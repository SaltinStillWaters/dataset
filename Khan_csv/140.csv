"What I want to do in the next few videos is try to see what happens to a line integral, either a line integral over a scalar field or a vector field, but what happens that line integral when we change the direction of our path?"
"So let's say, when I say change direction, let's say that I have some curve C that looks something like this."
We draw the x- and y- axis.
"So that's my y-axis, that is my x-axis, and let's say my parameterization starts there, and then as t increases, ends up over there just like that."
So it's moving in that direction.
"And when I say I reverse the path, we could define another curve."
"Let's call it minus C, that looks something like this."
"That is my y-axis, that is my x-axis."
"And it looks exactly the same, but it starts up here, and then as t increases, it goes down to the starting point of the other curve."
"So it's the exact same shape of a curve, but it goes in the opposite direction."
"So what I'm going to do in this video is just understand how we can construct a parameterization like this, and hopefully understand it pretty well."
"And then next two videos after this, we'll try to see what this actually does to the line integral, one for a scalar field, and then one for a vector field."
"So let's just say, this parameterization right here, let's just define it in the basic way that we've always defined them."
"Let's say that this is x = x of t, y = y of t, and let's say this is from t is =, or t, let me write this way."
"t starts at a, so t is greater than or = a, and it goes up to b."
"So in this example, this was when t = a, and the point right here is the coordinate x of a, y of a."
"And then when t = b up here, this is really just a review of what we've seen before, really just a review of parameterization, when t = b up here, this is the point x of b, y of b."
Nothing new there.
"Now given these functions, how can we construct another parameterization here that has the same shape, but that starts here?"
"So I want this to be, t = a."
Let me switch colors.
"Let me switch to, maybe, magenta."
"So I want this to be t = a, and as t increases, I want this to be t = b."
So I want to move in the opposite direction.
"So when t = a, I want my coordinate to still be x of b, y of b."
"When t = a, I want a b in each of these functions, and when t = b, I want the coordinate to be x of a, y of a."
Right?
"Notice, they're opposites now."
"Here t = a, x of a, y of a, here t = b, our endpoint."
"Now I'm at this coordinate, x of a, y of a."
So how do I construct that?
"Well, if you think about it, when t = a, we want both of these functions to evaluate it at b."
"So what if we define our x, in this case, for our minus C curve, what if we say x = x of, and when I say x of I'm talking about the same exact function."
"Actually, maybe I should write it in that same exact color."
"x of but instead of putting t in there, instead of putting a straight-up t in there, what if I put an a plus b minus t in there?"
What happens?
"Well, let me do it for the y as well."
"So then our y, y, = y of a plus b minus t."
a plus b minus is t.
"I'm using slightly different shades of yellow, might be a little disconcerting."
"Anyway, what happens when we define this?"
"When t = a, when t = a, let's say that this parameterization is also for t starts at a and then goes up to b."
"So let's just experiment and confirm that this parameterization really is the same thing as this thing, but it goes in an opposite direction."
"Or at least, confirm in our minds intuitively."
"So when t = a, when t = a, x will be = x of a plus b minus a, right?"
"This is when t = a, so minus t, or minus a, which = what?"
"Well, a minus a, cancel out, that's = x of b."
"Similarly, when t = a, y will be = y of a plus b minus a."
"The a's cancel out, so it's = y of b."
So that worked.
"When t = a, my parameterization evaluates to the coordinate x of b, y of b."
"When t = a, x of b, y of b."
Then we can do the exact same thing when t = b.
"I'll do it over here, because I don't want to lose this."
Let me just draw a line here.
I'm still dealing with this parameterization over here.
"Actually, let me scroll over to the right, just so that I don't get confused."
"When t = b, when t = b, what does x =?"
"x = x of a plus b minus b, right?"
a plus b minus b when t = b.
So that's = x of a.
"and then when she's able to be why = lie of a plus b minus b, and of course, that's going to be = y of a."
"So the endpoints work, and if you think about it intuitively, as t increases, so when t is at a, this thing is going to be x of b, y of b."
We saw that down here.
"Now as t increases, this value is going to decrease."
"We started x of b, y of b, and as t increases, this value is going to decrease to a, right?"
"It starts from b, and it goes to a."
"This one obviously starts at a, and it goes to b."
"So hopefully, that should give you the intuition why this is the exact same curve as that."
It just goes in a completely opposite direction.
"Now, with that out of the way, if you accept what I've told you, that these are really the same parameterizations, just opposite directions."
I shouldn't say same parameterizations.
"Same curve going in an opposite direction, or same path going in the opposite direction."
"In the next video, I'm going to see what happens when we evaluate this line integral, f of x ds, versus this line integral."
"So this is a scalar field, a line integral of a scalar field, using this curve or this path, but what happens if we take a line integral over the same scalar field, but we do it over this reverse path?"
That's what we're going to do in the next video.
"And the video after that, we'll do it for vector fields."
