Transcript for: Conceptual understanding of flux in three dimensions | Multivariable Calculus | 
Let's say we are operating.
.
.
.
.
.
in three dimensions.
And I have a function, rho, .
.
.
which is a function of (x, y, z).
.
.
.
.
.
and it gives us the mass density.
.
.
.
.
.
at any point in three dimensions, .
.
.
of some fluid.
Some particular fluid.
Maybe it's a gas, or a fluid, .
.
.
water.
Who knows what it is? Some type of substance.
It gives us the mass density.
.
.
.
.
.
at any point in three dimensions.
And let's say we have another.
.
.
.
.
.
function.
This is a scalar function.
It just gives us a number.
.
.
.
.
.
for any point in 3D.
And then, let's say we have another function, v, .
.
.
which is a vector function.
It gives us a vector.
.
.
.
.
.
for any point in three dimensions.
And this right over here tells us.
.
.
.
.
.
the velocity of that same.
.
.
.
.
.
the velocity of that same fluid or gas.
.
.
.
.
.
or whatever we're talking about.
Now let's imagine another function.
And this might all look a little bit familiar, because we did it.
.
.
We went through a very similar exercise.
.
.
.
.
.
in two dimensions when we talked about line integrals.
Now we're just extending it to three dimensions.
Let's say we have a function, f.
Let's say we have a function, f, .
.
.
and it =.
.
.
.
.
.
the product.
.
.
.
.
.
the product of rho and v.
So for any point in (x, y, z).
.
.
.
.
.
this will give us a vector, and then.
.
.
.
.
.
we'll multiply it times this scalar right over here.
.
.
.
.
.
for that same point in three dimensions.
So it's =.
.
.
.
.
.
rho times v.
Let me use the same color.
.
.
.
.
.
that I used for v before.
And there's a couple of ways you could conceptualize this, .
.
.
so you could view this as.
.
.
Obviously it maintains the direction of the velocity, .
.
.
but now its magnitude.
.
.
One way to think about it is.
.
.
.
.
.
kind of the momentum density.
And if that doesn't make too much sense, .
.
.
you don't have to worry too much about it.
Hopefully, as we use these two functions, .
.
.
and we talk think a little bit more.
.
.
.
.
.
about them relative to a surface, .
.
.
it'll make a little bit more conceptual sense.
Now, what I want to do.
.
.
.
.
.
is think about what it means.
.
.
.
.
.
what it means.
.
.
.
.
.
given this function, f, .
.
.
to evaluate the surface integral.
.
.
.
.
.
over some surface.
.
.
So we're going to evaluate over some surface.
We're going to evaluate f.
.
.
We're going to evaluate f dot n, .
.
.
where n is the unit normal vector at every.
.
.
at each point on that surface, .
.
.
dS.
d-surface.
So let's think about what this is saying.
So first, let me draw my axes.
So I have my z-axis.
z-axis.
.
.
This could be my.
.
.
Let's make that.
.
.
Let's make that my x-axis.
And let's say that this right over here.
.
.
.
.
.
is my y-axis.
And let's say my surface.
.
.
.
.
.
I'll use that same color.
.
.
My surface looks something like that.
So that is my surface.
That is the surface in question.
That is S.
Now let's think about the units, .
.
.
and hopefully that'll give us conceptual understanding.
.
.
.
.
.
of what this thing right over here is measuring.
It's completely analogous to.
.
.
.
.
.
what we did in the two-dimensional case.
.
.
.
.
.
with the line integrals.
So we have a dS.
A dS is a little chunk of area.
.
.
.
.
.
of that surface.
So that is dS.
So this is going to be area.
And if we want to break.
.
.
This is.
.
.
We want to pick particular units.
.
.
This could be square.
.
.
This could be square meters.
And I think when we do.
.
.
.
.
.
particular units, it starts to make.
.
.
.
.
.
a little bit more concrete sense.
Now, the normal vector.
.
.
.
.
.
at that dS.
.
.
The normal vector is going to.
.
.
.
.
.
point right out of it.
It's literally normal to that plane.
It's literally normal to that plane.
It has a magnitude 1.
So that is our unit normal vector.
And f is defined throughout this three-dimensional space.
You give me any (x, y, z), .
.
.
I'll know its mass density, .
.
.
I'll know its velocity, .
.
.
and I'll get some f.
I'll get some f at any point.
.
.
.
.
.
at any point in three-dimensional space, .
.
.
including on the surface.
Including right over here.
So right over here, f might look.
.
.
.
.
.
f might look something like this.
So that is f right at that point.
Right at that point.
So what does all of this mean? Well when you take the dot product.
.
.
.
.
.
of two vectors, this is essentially saying, "How much do they go together?" And since n is a unit vector, .
.
.
since it has a magnitude 1, .
.
.
it's this is essentially saying.
.
"What is.
.
.
" "What is the magnitude.
.
.
.
.
.
of the component of f.
.
.
.
.
.
that's going in the direction of n?" Or the component Or.
.
.
"What is the magnitude of the.
.
.
.
.
.
component of f that is.
.
.
.
.
.
normal to the surface?" Or "How much of f is normal.
.
.
.
.
.
to the surface?" So the component of f that is.
.
.
.
.
.
normal to the surface.
.
.
.
.
.
might look something like.
.
.
.
.
.
might look something.
.
.
.
.
.
like that.
Might look something like that.
And this right over here.
.
.
.
.
.
will essentially just give.
.
.
.
.
.
the magnitude of that.
And it's just going to.
.
.
It's just going to keep the units of f.
n, right over here, just specifies.
.
.
.
.
.
a direction.
It has no units associated with it.
It's dimensionless.
f's units are going to be.
.
.
.
.
.
units of mass density, So it could be.
.
.
It's going to be.
.
.
Let's say it could be.
.
.
.
.
.
kilogram per meter-cubed.
That's.
.
.
Well that's actually just the rho part.
So it's mass density times velocity.
Times meters per second.
Let me write it in those colors.
.
.
.
.
.
so we have.
.
.
.
.
.
clear what's happening here.
So the units of f.
.
.
.
.
.
are going to be the units of rho.
.
.
.
.
.
which are going to be.
.
.
.
.
.
kilogram per cubic meter.
.
.
That's mass density.
.
.
.
times the units of v.
.
.
.
.
.
which is meters per second.
Meters per second.
And we're going to multiply that times meters squared.
So what you have is.
.
.
You have a meter and then.
.
.
.
.
.
a meter squared in the numerator.
.
.
That's meters cubed in the numerator.
And meters cubed in the denominator.
That, that, that cancels out.
And so the units that we get for this.
.
.
The units that we get for this.
.
.
.
.
.
are kilogram per second.
And so the way to conceptualize it.
.
.
Given how we've defined f.
.
.
.
.
.
when we say what we say f represents.
.
.
The way to conceptualize this.
.
.
This is saying, "How much mass.
.
.
" "How much mass, given this mass density, .
.
.
this velocity, is going directly.
.
.
.
.
.
out of this little dS, .
.
.
this little.
.
.
.
.
.
'infinitesimally' chunk of surface.
.
.
.
.
.
in a given amount of time?" And then if we were to add up.
.
.
.
.
.
all of the dS-es, .
.
.
and this is what essentially that surface integral is, .
.
.
we're essentially saying, "How much mass, .
.
.
in kilograms per second, .
.
.
that's what we picked.
.
.
How much mass.
.
.
.
.
.
is traveling across this surface.
.
.
.
.
.
at any given moment in time?" And this is really the same idea we do with.
.
.
.
.
.
the line integrals.
This is essentially the flux through a two-dimensional surface.
So this is.
.
.
.
.
.
the flux through a 2D surface.
And this isn't like.
.
.
.
.
.
some crazy, abstract thing.
I mean, you could imagine.
.
.
You know, you could imagine.
.
.
.
.
.
something like water vapor in your bathroom.
Water vapor in your bathroom.
And I like to imagine that, .
.
.
because that's actually visible, .
.
.
especially when sunlight is shining through it.
And we've all seen water vapor.
.
.
.
.
.
through a.
.
.
.
.
.
water vapor in our bathroom when.
.
.
.
.
.
you have a ray of sunlight, and you can see.
.
.
.
.
.
how the particles.
.
.
.
.
.
how the particles are traveling.
And you see they have a certain density.
.
.
.
.
.
at different points.
And so you could imagine.
.
.
You could imagine.
.
.
You care about the surface.
.
.
.
.
.
the surface of your.
.
.
Maybe you have a window.
Maybe you have a window in the bathroom.
So you have a window.
And so, if you were.
.
.
If the surface was the window, .
.
.
and the window.
.
.
And let's say the window's open, .
.
.
so it's kind of a.
.
.
There's nothing physical there.
It's just kind of a.
.
.
.
.
.
a rectangular surface that.
.
.
.
.
.
things can pass freely through, .
.
.
if and f was essentially.
.
.
.
.
.
the mass density of the water vapor times.
.
.
.
.
.
the velocity of the water vapor, .
.
.
then this thing right over here will essentially tell you.
.
.
.
.
.
the mass of water vapor that is traveling.
.
.
.
.
.
through that window at any given moment of time.
Another way to think about it is.
.
.
Imagine a.
.
.
Imagine a river.
And I'm going to conceptualize this river.
.
.
.
.
.
as kind of a.
.
.
.
.
.
just a section of the river.
And I'm conceptualizing it.
.
.
This is kind of.
.
.
.
.
.
a river.
Obviously this would be the surface.
.
.
.
.
.
that we normally see.
But obviously it has some depth.
It's three-dimensional in nature.
And so we would know the density.
Maybe it's constant.
You know the density, and you know the velocity.
.
.
.
.
.
at any point.
That's what f gives us.
So that tells us.
.
.
As we said, we could view that as the.
.
.
.
.
.
momentum density at any given point in time.
And maybe our surface is some type of a net.
Our surface is some type of a net.
And the net doesn't even have to be rectangular.
It could be some weird-shaped net.
But I'll do it in rectangular, just because it's.
.
.
.
.
.
easier to draw.
It's some type of net that in no way impedes the flow.
.
.
.
.
.
of the fluid.
Then once again, .
.
.
when you evaluate this integral, .
.
.
it would tell you the mass of fluid that is flowing.
.
.
.
.
.
through that net.
.
.
.
.
.
at any given moment of time.
So hopefully this makes.
.
.
.
.
.
a little bit of conceptual sense now.
In the next few videos, .
.
.
we'll actually think about.
.
.
.
.
.
how to.
.
.
.
.
.
how to calculate this, .
.
.
and how we can actually represent it.
.
.
.
.
.
in different ways.
