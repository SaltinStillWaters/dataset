Transcript for: Calculus 1 Review -  Basic Introduction
this video is for those of you who might be going back to school and taking a calculus course let's start with limits so let's say we have some function f of x and it's equal to x squared minus four over x minus two what is the limit as x approaches two of that function so what exactly is a limit what does it do so basically what this question is asking is as x approaches 2 what does the y value or what does f of x approach now one of the first things you could try is direct substitution if we plug in 2 into the function it's going to be 2 squared minus 4 over 2 minus two two squared is four four minus four is zero and two minus two is zero zero divided by zero is undefined so that won't help us so what we can do instead is we can plug in a number that is very close to 2. let's try 1.9 so let's find the value of f of 1.9 so that's going to be 1.9 squared minus 4 over 1.9 minus 2. 1.9 squared minus 4 that's negative 0.39 1.9 minus 2 is negative 0.1 when you divide these two you're going to get positive 3.9 now what if we plug in a number that's even closer to 2 so let's say 1.99 what's going to happen well let's see what we're going to get so 1.99 squared minus 4. that's negative point zero three nine nine and one point nine this is supposed to be a two by the way not a four so let me just fix that 1.99 minus two that's equal to negative 0.01 and so let's divide these two numbers and this is equal to 3.99 so here's the question for you as x gets closer to two what happens to the y value or basically the value of the function notice that it gets closer and closer to four 3.99 is a lot closer to 4 than 3.9 is so therefore we can make the conclusion that the limit as x approaches 2 as we get closer and closer to 2 the value of this function approaches four and so this direct substitution technique can always work if you can't plug in the number directly you can plug in a number that's very close to this number and as you'll see the limit approaches a certain value now let's go back to the first problem it turns out that there's another way in which we could get the same answer so even though we can't plug in two directly because it's going to be undefined we can simplify the expression we can factor x squared minus 4. and it's a difference of perfect squares so it's going to be x plus two times x minus two so notice that we can cancel a factor we could cancel x minus two and so what we have now is the limit as x approaches two of x plus two at this point we can use direct substitution we're no longer going to have an undefined value so if we replace x with 2 it's going to be 2 plus 2 which is equal to 4 which confirms our previous answer so sometimes there are certain algebraic techniques that you can use to evaluate this limit other than using direct substitution with numbers that approaches two now that technique always works so it's a good fallback method but on a test you may have to show your work so you need to also learn the analytical methods with it as well so i'm going to give you four problems and i want you to evaluate the limit so let's start with this one what is the limit as x approaches 3 of x squared plus 5x minus 4. feel free to pause the video and work on this example now in this problem we could use direct substitution if we plug in 3 we're not going to get an undefined value we're not going to get a 0 in the denominator of a fraction so always check to see if direct substitution will work so this is going to be 3 squared plus 5 times 3 minus 4. 3 squared is 9. 5 times three is fifteen and fifteen minus four is eleven nine plus eleven is twenty and so this is the answer for this example now what about this one what is the limit as x approaches 3 of x squared minus 8x plus 15 divided by x minus 3. now if we try to use direct substitution if we plug in three three minus three is going to give us a zero in the bottom of the fraction which will make it undefined so therefore we don't want to do that let's see if we could factor the trinomial on top so what two numbers multiply to 15 but add to negative eight so we know that three times five is fifteen but we need it to add up to negative eight so we need to use negative three and negative five so therefore x squared minus eight x plus fifteen is equal to x minus three times x minus five and now we can cancel x minus three so we're left with the limit as x approaches three of x minus five by the way some teachers will require you that they want you to rewrite the limit expression until you replace x with three some teachers will take off points if you don't rewrite the limit expression so i just want to give you that warning so you don't lose points on a test so now let's plug in three so it's going to be three minus five at this point we don't need to rewrite the limit and this is equal to negative two and this is the answer now what about this one what is the limit as x approaches 4 given a complex fraction 1 over x minus 1 over 4 divided by x minus 4. now in this case we can't factor there's nothing to factor in this example but whenever you have a complex fraction here's my recommendation multiply the top and the bottom by the common denominator of the smaller fractions that you see so in this case let's multiply the top portion of the fraction by 4x and the bottom by 4x on top let's distribute 4x times 1 over x the x variables will cancel leaving behind four and don't forget to rewrite the limit expression so this is positive four and then if we multiply four x by one over four this time the fours will cancel leaving behind negative x on the bottom you don't need to change anything don't distribute the 4x just leave it the way it is notice that 4 minus x and x minus 4 are very similar they're not exactly the same at this point but there's something that we can do in the next step let's take out a negative one from four minus x let's factor it out if we factor out a negative one negative x changes to positive x and positive four will change to negative four so notice that now we can cancel x minus four so we're left with the limit as x approaches four of negative one divided by four x now we could substitute x with four and we don't need to rewrite the limit expression at this point so it's negative one divided by four times four and so the answer is negative one over sixteen so this is it now let's confirm that negative 1 over 16 is indeed the answer to this problem so if you're not sure you can always plug in a number that's close to 4. you can't plug in 4 directly because 4 minus 4 is 0. let's plug in a number that's close to 4. let's use 4.1 and then let's use 4.01 so let's find the value of f of point one so that's one over four point one minus one over four divided by four point one minus four now one over four point one minus one fourth that's equal to negative point zero zero six zero nine seven five and there's a six after that four point one minus four is just point one and so this gives you negative point zero six zero nine seven five six so let's keep this value for now now let's try f of 4.01 so that's 1 over 4.01 minus 1 4. over four point zero one minus four so the numerator has a value of negative point zero zero zero six two three four and the denominator is going to be point zero one so i'm gonna put this value up top since i'm out of space on the bottom so this is about negative point 0.0623 now let's say if we want to go further if we want to try f of 4.00 i'm not going to write it out i'm just going to type it in the calculator so this is going to be negative point zero six two four eight so notice that it's converging to a certain value here it was negative point zero six zero nine here it's a negative point zero six two three and now it's negative point zero six two four and i'm missing a zero it's supposed to be zero somewhere here so it's converging to a certain value which means that the limit exists now negative 1 over 16 if you type this in your calculator and convert it to a decimal this is negative point zero six two five as you can see these two answers are very close even though they're not exact but as x approaches the four as it gets closer and closer to four this value is converging to negative one over sixteen or negative point zero sixty five i keep forgetting the zero but that's supposed to be point zero six two five let's try one more problem evaluate the limit as x approaches nine given the function square root x minus three over x minus nine now if you're not sure what to do and if you have a multiple choice test you could find the value of f of 9.01 so that's close to 9. so let's see what this is equal to so this is 0.16662 so basically let's say 0.167 so the answer should be close to this value and if you want a better answer plug in 9.001 or even 9.001 the closer it is to 9 the more accurate the answer will be but if you have a free response test then you have to show your work whenever you have a square root inside a fraction what you want to do is you want to multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate of the numerator in this case by the square root of x plus 3 as opposed to minus 3 so don't forget to change the sign and whatever you do to the top you must also do to the bottom now on the numerator we're going to foil the square root of x times the square root of x is simply x and then here we have positive 3 square root x and then let's multiply negative 3 by root x so that's negative 3 square root x and then negative 3 times 3 is negative 9. now what i recommend is not to foil these two keep it the way it is it's going to work out nicely if you don't foil x minus nine with the square root of x plus three and let's rewrite the limit expression so now we can cancel positive three square root x and negative three square x three plus negative three adds up to zero so what we have left over is x minus nine divided by x minus nine times the square root of x plus 3. so notice now that we could cancel x minus 9. so once you get rid of this x minus 9 factor you can now plug in 9 because this it prevents us from do so it will give us a 0 on the bottom so once that's gone now we can use direct substitution with the exact value so once we plug it in we don't need to rewrite the limit expression so all of this is equal to one over the square root of nine plus three and the square root of nine is three and three plus three is six so the final answer is one over six that's the exact answer now one over six as a decimal is basically point one six six six six repeating so you could say point one six which is basically point one six seven it's close to that so these two values they're in harmony with each other so whenever you're evaluating limits analytically see if you can either factor or if you have a complex fraction multiply the top and the bottom by the common denominator or if you have a fraction with a square root symbol inside of it multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate of the square root factor now the next thing that you need to be able to do is you need to know how to evaluate a limit graphically so let's say if you want to find these four things what is the limit as x approaches negative 3 from the left side so that's a one-sided limit and what is the limit as x approaches negative 3 from the right side the right side is indicated by the positive superscript and what is the limit as x approaches negative three from either side and finally what's the value of f of negative three so these are common questions that you might see in a test when that'll went i lost my uh the cat caught my tongue when evaluating limits graphically so what is the value that f of x approaches as x approaches negative three from the left so first identify the value where x is negative three so that's this point here now if we follow the function from the left as we approach an x value of negative three we're going to be on this curve so we're approaching negative three and notice that the y value there is one so therefore as x approaches negative three from the left side f of x approaches one now what about from the right side so anywhere along this vertical line x is negative three so we're going to approach that x value starting from the right side and so it's going to take us to this vicinity where the y value is 2. so as x approaches negative three from the right side f of x is equal to two now what about the limit as x approaches negative three from either side if the left side and the right side if they differ then here's something important that you need to know the limit does not exist unless these two match the limit will not exist now what about the last one what is the value of f of negative 3 so when x is exactly negative 3 what is the function value so in this case we need to look for the closed circle at an x value of negative three and basically that closed circle has a value of negative one on the y axis so f of negative three is equal to negative one now whenever the limit doesn't exist you have a certain type of discontinuity this particular discontinuity is known as a jump discontinuity because there's a disconnect in a graph a jump discontinuity is also known as a non-removable discontinuity so let me give you some more questions relating to this topic so what is the limit as x approaches negative 1 from the left side and what is the limit as x approaches negative one from the right side now once you find those two values i want you to find the limit as x approaches negative one from either side and then find a value of f of negative one so anywhere along this vertical line x is equal to negative one so as we approach it as we approach an x value of negative one from the left side notice that the y value approaches negative three now as we approach it from the right side the y value is still negative three so notice that the left side and the right side have the same value therefore the limit exists and it's equal to negative three now what about f of negative one so along this line you want to look for the closed circle and here it is and it has a y value of negative two so f of negative one is negative two now this type of continuity or rather discontinuity where the limit exists but it doesn't equal to the function value is known as a whole and that type of discontinuity is known as a removable discontinuity so that's simply a whole now let's talk about another problem what is the limit as x approaches negative two from the left side and also what's the limit as x approaches negative two from the right side and also from either side and finally what's f of negative two so as x approaches negative 2 from the left side so here's where x is negative 2. as we approach from the left side notice that the graph goes higher and higher and higher so therefore it approaches positive infinity now as we approach negative two from the right side notice that it goes down towards negative infinity and these two they don't match so therefore the limit doesn't exist some teachers will also say that infinity because it's not a specific number they will define it as the limit not exist in two so just keep that in mind now what about f of negative two now there's no closed circle along that vertical line so therefore this value does not exist either you could say it's undefined because typically whenever you have let's say if you were to graph one over x minus two you're going to see a vertical asymptote at x minus two and at two if you plug it in you'd say it's undefined because f of two will equal one over zero so whenever the function doesn't exist due to a vertical line you could also say that it's undefined because that's why you have a vertical asymptote typically because there's a zero in the denominator so just keep that in mind now let's try one more set of problems what is the limit as x approaches 1 from the left one from the right one from either side and also let's find the value of f of one by the way you need to know what type of discontinuity this represents that's known as an infinite discontinuity and it's also a non-removable discontinuity now let's move on to the next problem as x approaches 1 from the left side notice that the y value approaches one and as x approaches one from the right side the y value is still negative one so because these two are the same as x approaches one from either side is going to be negative one the limit exists now f of one is also negative one because we have a closed circle at this point even if there's if there were no close circle if there was a straight line if we didn't have an open circle it would still be negative one now whenever all four of these values match up the function is continuous at x equals one whenever there's a mismatch it's discontinuous either it could be a whole it could be an infinite discontinuity or it could be a jump discontinuity when all four of these values match then we can say that the function is continuous at x equals one

Transcript for: Functions
number one calculate the value of f of two using the function shown below so all we need to do is replace x with two so we have two to the third plus five times two squared minus nine two times two times two is eight two squared or two times two is four and five times four is twenty twenty minus 9 is 11 8 plus 11 is 19. so therefore answer choice e is the right answer number two find the inverse function using the function shown below so feel free to pause the video and work on this example so let's replace f of x with y next switch x and y and then just solve for y in order to get rid of the radical we need to raise both sides of the equation to the fifth power so that these two will cancel so right now we have x to the fifth is equal to seven y plus three i mean minus three now let's add three to both sides so x to the fifth power plus three is equal to seven y and then divide both sides by seven so x to the fifth plus three divided by seven is equal to y which is also equal to the inverse function and so this is the answer number three if f of x is equal to negative 15 what is the value of x so let's replace f of x with negative 15. now since we have a negative in front of 2x squared let's take everything from the right side and move it to the left side so if we have a negative in front of the 2x squared on the right side on the left side is going to be positive 2x squared 5x is positive on the right side it's going to be negative on the left negative 3 is going to change to plus 3. and let's keep the negative 15 on the left side 3 minus 15 is negative 12. so now we need to factor we have a trinomial where the leading coefficient is not one so we need to multiply the leading coefficient by the constant term in order to factor it 2 times negative 12 is negative 24 and two numbers that multiply to negative 24 but add to the middle coefficient negative five that's going to be negative eight and three so now let's replace the middle term that is negative five x with negative eight x plus 3x and then we could factor by grouping so let's take out the gcf in the first two terms and that's going to be 2x 2x squared divided by 2x is x negative 8x divided by two x is negative four and now in the last two terms let's take out a three and so this is what we're gonna have now we can factor the gcf which is x minus 4. if we take that out we'll be left with 2x plus 3. now let's set x minus four equal to zero and two x plus three equal to zero so x is four two x is negative three and x is negative three over two so we have two answers but the only one that's listed is answer choice d number four what is f of g of x so what do we need to do here first let's replace g of x with what it's equal to that is x minus five so we're looking for f of x minus five which means that we need to take x minus five and plug it into each x value that we see here so it's x minus five squared plus three times x minus five plus two x minus 5 squared that's x minus 5 times x minus 5. if we foil it it's going to be x squared minus ten x plus twenty five if we distribute three to x minus five it's going to be three x minus fifteen and then plus two so now let's combine like terms we can add these two and then we can combine those negative 10x plus 3x is negative 7x 25 minus fifteen is ten ten plus two is twelve so the answer is x squared minus seven x plus twelve number five what is the value of g of f of two so first let's find the value of f two let's replace x with two two to the third is equal to eight five times two is ten and eight minus ten is negative two negative two plus one is negative one so that's the value of f of two and we're looking for g of f of two and since f of 2 is negative 1 we need to find g of negative 1. so now let's use this equation so it's 7 minus negative 1 squared negative 1 squared is negative 1 times negative one that's positive one and seven minus one is six so g of f of two is equal to six therefore b is the right answer number six are f and x and g of x are they inverses of each other how can we prove if they're inverses of each other so we have to show that f of g of x is equal to x and also g of f of x we need to prove that this is equal to x if we can do that that we know for certain that f and x and g of x are inverses of each other so let's start with the first one f of g of x let's plug in g of x into f so this is going to be f of one third x squared minus one so we're going to take this and insert it into this equation so it's going to be the square root of 3 and then instead of writing 3x we're going to replace x with 1 3 times x squared minus 1. then we have a plus one inside the square root three times one third is simply one so we have one times x squared minus one and that's just x squared minus one negative one plus one adds up to zero and the square root of x squared is x now let's move on to the other side let's replace f of x with the square root of three x plus one and let's plug this into this equation so it's going to be one third and instead of writing x squared we're gonna write square root three x plus one squared minus one so the square and the square root will cancel and so we're just going to get three x plus one and then we have a minus one outside of that one minus one adds up to zero so what we have left over is one third of three x which is equal to x therefore f of x and g of x are inverses of each other number seven which of the following graphs is not a function in order to find the answer we need to see which one does not pass the vertical line test starting with a if we draw a vertical line we can see that it touches it only once which means that a is a function if we do the same thing for b it touches the vertical line only once so b is a function and d is also a function it passes the vertical line test but c is not a function if we draw it at that location we can see that it touches the vertical line three times so the right answer is c number eight which of the following is not a one-to-one function is it a b c or d in order to find out which one is not a one-to-one function we need to see which one will fail the horizontal line test so starting with a if we draw a horizontal line we can see that the curve touches it once so a is a one-to-one function it passes the horizontal line test if a function is one-to-one that means that the inverse function is a function which means the inverse function passes the vertical line test so looking at b if we draw a horizontal line it passes the test it touches the point only once so b is a one-to-one function and the same is true for d d is one to one as well looking at c it does not pass the horizontal line test it touches the horizontal line at two points so therefore c is the answer c is not a one to one function if you were to draw the inverse function for c it will look something like this and since c is not a one-to-one function since c doesn't pass the horizontal line test the inverse will not pass the vertical line test and so the inverse function is not a function number nine if f of four comma y is 48 what is the value of y so we can replace this with 48 because the function is 48 and x is equal to four the first number corresponds to x the second number corresponds to y and our goal is to find the value of y four squared is four times four that's sixteen three times four is twelve and so this is what we have now we could divide everything by two because all the numbers that we see here are even so half of 48 is 24 half of 16 is 8 half of 12 is 6 half of 2 is 1. and now let's subtract both sides by 24. let's write it in standard form so it's y squared plus 6y and 8 minus 24 is negative 16. so let's go ahead and factor what two numbers multiply to negative 16 but adds a positive six so this is eight and negative two so this is going to be y plus eight and y minus two so therefore y is equal to negative eight and it's equal to 2. 2 is the answer because that's the one that's listed so b is the right answer number 10 what is the domain of f divided by g so f divided by g that's going to be seven x minus three divided by x squared plus two x minus fifteen so x can be anything except any value that's going to produce a zero in the denominator so therefore x squared plus 2x minus 15 cannot equal zero let's go ahead and factor the expression what two numbers multiply to negative 15 but add to the middle coefficient too this is positive five and negative three so it's going to be x plus five times x minus three so therefore x plus five cannot equal zero and x minus three cannot equal zero so x cannot equal negative five and x cannot equal three so x is all real numbers except those two values so to write the answer using interval notation it's going to look like this negative infinity to negative five that means x could be anything from negative infinity to negative five but it doesn't include negative five union x could be anything between negative five and three but not negative five or three and then union three to infinity x can be anything greater than three so that's the domain of f divided by g 

Transcript for: Vertical Line Test
in this video we're going to talk about how to tell if a graph represents a function using the vertical line test so let's start with a linear function y equals x and this function looks like this is basically a straight line so now we need to do is draw a vertical line notice that the function touches the vertical line only at one point so that means this graph is a function now let's try another example so this graph is associated with the equation x is equal to y squared is it a function now if we draw a vertical line notice that it touches the line more than one point it touches out two points so therefore this is not a function it doesn't pass the vertical line test now here's another example for you so let's say if we have a parabola this is y is equal to x squared is it a function what would you say well let's see if it passes the vertical line test notice that it touched it only at one point so this passes the vertical line test now what if we have a circle let's say the equation is x squared plus y squared is equal to nine is it a function well we can clearly see that it's not going to be a function it touches the vertical line at two points so therefore that's not a function now what about this equation y equals three does it pass the vertical line test y equals three is a horizontal line and so if we draw a vertical line it's going to pass the vertical line test it touched it only at one point but now what about x equals four will that pass the vertical line test so x equals four is a vertical line and if you draw a vertical line on it it's going to touch it at an infinite number of points so that's not going to be a function now what about these two graphs let's say the square root of x and also the absolute value of x go ahead and try these two determine if they're functions or not so the square root of x looks like this and the absolute value function is like a v shape so this one passes the vertical line test and so there's this one so they both represent functions here's another two examples that you could try try that one and also this one on the right this is the graph for sine x so looking at the first one we can clearly see that it does not pass the vertical line test it touches it at least three points for that particular vertical line now the sine function is a function and it passes the vertical line test but this one does not now what about this function x cubed and also the cube root of x now the fact that i call it a function indicates that it's probably going to pass the vertical line test so x cubed looks like this and the cube root of x looks like that and both of them are functions as you can see they pass the vertical line test and let's consider one more example so is this graph a function well we can see that it does not pass the vertical line test it touches at two points so now you know how to tell if a function or if a graph represents a function using the vertical line test you 

Transcript for: Domain and Range of a Function From a Graph
in this video i want to give you a basic introduction into domain and range and how to write the expression using interval notation given the graph of a function so what is the domain and range of this particular function now the domain tells you the x values of the function the range tells you the y values of the function so let's focus on the domain first what is the lowest x value of the function the lowest x value as seen here is negative four the highest x value is three and this function contains every x value in between negative four and three so in interval notation we could say that the domain is from negative four to three and we're going to use brackets because it includes negative four and three so that's how you can write the domain for this particular function now what about the range what's the range of this particular function well let's focus on the y values the lowest y value that we see this is negative five now the highest y value is four and there's no breaks in the graph this graph is continuous from negative five to four along the y axis so therefore the range is going to be negative 5 to 4 and so that's a simple way to determine the domain and range of a function using a graph now go ahead and try that example find the domain and range of the function so let's start with the x values the lowest x value is at negative six and the highest we could see is positive six now notice that we have an open circle at negative six so negative 6 is not included so i'm going to use the parentheses for that so it's going to be negative 6 to 6 but here we have a closed circle so that's going to be associated with a bracket and so that's the domain for this particular function now what about the range so let's focus on the y values the lowest y value occurs at negative 4 and the highest y value occurs at five but negative four is not included so it's going to be negative four to five but five is included so that's the range for this particular function go ahead and try this example what's the domain and range of that function so let's start with the x values the lowest x value is one now notice we have an arrow so this goes all the way to infinity so therefore the domain is going to be from 1 to infinity now how about the range the lowest y value is 2 and because of this arrow it's going to go up and to the right indefinitely so therefore the highest y value technically is infinity because this doesn't end so the range is going to be from 2 let me write that better 2 to infinity and 2 is included because we have a closed circle now here's the next example we have a downward parabola and how can we determine the domain and range of it so let's start with the x values so once again we have an arrow that means it's going to go down as it slowly goes to the left so it's going to keep going to the left forever and we have an error on the right side so it keeps going to the right side forever so therefore the lowest x value because it goes all the way to the left is negative infinity and because it goes all the way to the right the highest x value is positive infinity so the domain is going to be negative infinity to infinity always use a parenthesis symbol next to an infinity symbol now let's focus on the range the y values the lowest y value we can clearly see that it's a negative infinity because it keeps going down forever but the highest y value is stream and never goes beyond three so the range starting from the lowest value to the highest value is negative infinity to three including three and so that's how you can determine the domain and range of a parabola now let's try some harder examples if you want to pause the video and work on this one so let's start with the domain let's focus on the x values so the lowest x value is negative six the highest x value is five and notice that there's a jump in the graph at negative one however x can be negative one so x could be anything between negative six and five except negative six because we have an open circle at negative six but it can be negative one because we do have a closed circle at negative one so the domain for this one is going to be negative six to five because it could be any x value between negative six and five just not negative six now what about the range what about the y values so the lowest y value that we see is negative four and the highest is positive four now notice that there's nothing between negative one i mean negative two and one so y can't be anything between there it could be negative two though because we do have a closed circle at negative two but it can't be negative one negative point five point eight it can't even be one because we have an open circle at one so how can we describe the range using interval notation in this example what we need to do is we need to use the union symbol that will connect the range of this expression with the range of this expression omen and everything in between since there's nothing there so we're going to go in this direction from the low value to the high value so the lowest value the lowest y value that is is negative 4 and we need to use parentheses because we have an open circle so it goes from negative four to negative two now we have a closed circle at negative two so we're gonna use brackets and then union so this is for the first graph so let's connect it to the second part of the graph we're going to start back up at 1 and end at 4. now 1 is not included we have an open circle but we have a closed circle at 4 so 4 is included and so this represents the range of this particular function so hopefully this makes sense to you and the best way to learn this is to do a few examples so this is going to be the last example for this video go ahead and determine the domain and range let's see if you understand how to do it now so let's start with the x values the first x value of interest is at negative eight the next x value that i want to take note of which ends this portion of the graph that's that negative four and then the second part of the graph starts back up at negative two and it ends at five now the third part of the graph it starts back up again at seven and then we have an arrow so it goes to infinity so basically these numbers that we see here we just have to use that to write the domain so the lowest x value it starts at negative eight and it includes negative eight and then it stops at negative four but it doesn't include negative four so let's use parentheses union now for the second part of the graph it starts at negative two and it includes it and it stops at five and it doesn't include 5. and then union it starts back up at 7 and then ends at infinity so that's the domain for this particular graph now let's focus on the y values the range so let's focus on this one the lowest value that i see here is negative six now this is not the highest value of this function so i'm not going to worry about it the highest value is here which is that one so this graph includes everything from negative six to one notice that this open circle is not relevant it's not equal to negative 4 at this point but it is equal to negative 4 at this point if you draw a horizontal line notice that there's two possible locations at which it can equal negative 4 here and here it doesn't equal negative four here but it does equal negative four here so y can be negative four so we have everything from negative six to one now let's focus on this one i don't need to worry about this point because it's already included in this graph the highest y value here is two so notice that y could be anything from negative six to two it could be one here and here so i don't need to worry about this one now notice that there's nothing between two and five there's no graph in this region so that's where i need a union now the highest y value is going to be infinity because of the arrow so these are the points of interest so the range is going to be negative six to two it does include two and then union five it does include five to infinity now if this section confuses you here's what you can do now let's focus on these two parts separately let's say if we want to write the range of each one separately the first one just this portion is going to be negative six to one and it includes one now the second part is going to be this starts at negative three by the way and it stops at two now if we want to find the union between these two expressions or these two sets represented in interval notation what would it be the union of those two is going to be negative six to two let's say if we drew a number line here's negative six here's one and then for the second one this is going to be negative three and this is going to be two so here's the first one negative six to one and here's the second one negative three to two so if we combine those two into one number line if we found a union between them it's going to look something like this it's going to start at negative 6 in a different color and then it's going to stop at 2. which gives us this expression so what you could do is find the range for each portion of the graph separately and then just find a union for anywhere they overlap and that would still give you the range or if you could see it graphically i would just do it the first way but that's it for this video thanks again for watching you 

Transcript for: Evaluating Piecewise Functions | PreCalculus
in this lesson we're going to focus on evaluating piecewise functions a piecewise function is a function that can be broken up into many parts so this particular piecewise function can be equal to 4x plus 5 or 3x minus 8 depending on the x value so let's say it's equal to 4x plus 5 when x is less than 2 and it's equal to 3x minus 8 when x is equal to or greater than two so go ahead and find the value of f of negative two f of two and f of five feel free to pause the video and work on this problem so let's evaluate the function when x is negative 2. so should we use this portion of the piecewise function or the bottom part should we use 4x plus 5 or 3x minus 8. negative two is less than positive two it's not equal to or greater than positive two so therefore negative two corresponds to this range so we need to use the first part of the piecewise function so let's replace x with negative two four times negative two is negative eight negative eight plus five is negative three so f of negative two is negative three now what about f of positive two should we use four x plus five or three x minus eight now x is equal to two in this equality not in this one so we have to use three x minus eight so it's going to be three times two minus eight three times two is six six minus eight is negative two and that's the answer now what is the function value at five so once again five is greater than two so we need to use three x minus eight so it's gonna be three times five minus eight three times five is fifteen fifteen minus 8 is 7. and that's it let's work on some more examples so let's say if we have the function f of x and it's equal to x squared plus three x minus seven when x is less than negative one and it's equal to five x plus six when x is greater than or equal to negative one actually let me change that let's say when x is greater than or equal to negative one but less than two and let's say it's uh equal to x cubed plus four when x is greater than two and is equal to twelve when x equals two so with this information i want you to evaluate f of negative 4 f of let's say 0 f of two and f of three so feel free to pause the video and try that so let's evaluate the function at x equals negative four so negative four is less than negative one therefore we need to use x squared plus three x minus seven so this is going to be negative four squared plus three times negative four minus seven negative four squared or negative four times negative four that's sixteen three times negative four is negative twelve and six minus twelve is four four minus seven is negative three so f of negative four is equal to negative three so that's the first answer i believe my math is correct i don't think i made any mistakes on that now let's evaluate f of zero zero is between negative one and two so we need to use five x plus six so this is going to be five times zero plus six five times zero is zero zero plus six is six now what about the next one f of 2. now when x is exactly 2 the function is equal to 12. so f of 2 is 12. there's no math involved in that step now what about the last one f of three when x is three we need to use x cubed plus four because that's when x is greater than two when x is three so therefore this is going to be 3 raised to the third power plus 4. so 3 to the third power is 27 27 plus 4 is equal to 31 and that covers that problem you 

Transcript for: Increasing and Decreasing Functions | Pre-Calculus
in this video we're going to focus on increasing and decreasing functions so a function is increasing when the graph is going up as you move from left to right it's constant when it's just maintaining the same y value if it's horizontal and it's decreasing if it's going down as you move from left to right so in this region the function is relatively constant i know my graph is not perfect but we're going to be reasonable with it in the second part it's increasing it's going up in a third part it's constant and then in the last part it's decreasing it's going down so let's focus on the intervals where it's increasing first so it's increasing and we're going to use the x values to describe it it's increasing starting from negative 2 and ending at negative one so we're going to write negative two to negative one now it doesn't include negative two or negative one because at this exact point you can't say it's increasing our constant so we're gonna use parentheses now let's talk about when it's decreasing so it's decreasing when it's going down and it's going down starting at one but ending that three so it's decreasing from one to three now when is the function constant let me use a different color to describe it so it's constant starting from negative four to negative two and starting back up from negative one to one so for the first part it's constant from negative four to negative two and then union we need to connect that with the second part where it's constant and that's from negative one to one and so that's it so now you know how to determine when the function is decreasing when it's increasing and when it's constant you know what i put d for this one this should be c for constant so let's just fix that so let's work on some more examples let's try this one so notice that in the first part the function is decreasing at this section and then in this section it's increasing so i'm going to put i there for increasing and then it's constant and then after that it's decreasing so let's put a d there and then it goes up it's increasing so let's determine the intervals where the function is increasing first so it's increasing starting around negative four doesn't have to be exact and then it stops approximately at negative two and then it increases again starting around two ish and we have an arrow so that's gonna continue on to infinity so we could say that it's increasing starting from negative 4 to negative 2 that's the first part and then union let's connect it to the second part from 2 to infinity now when is the function decreasing so it's decreasing in this section all the way to the left it starts from negative infinity and then it stops decreasing at negative four and then it starts back up around zero that's an x value of zero to two let me write that better now it's constant only from negative two to zero and that's it so here's the last example finding intervals on which the function is increasing decreasing a constant so during the first part notice that the function is increasing and then in this part here notice that it's decreasing and then here it's increasing again and then finally it's decreasing so it's not constant for any significant period of time so we could say the function is increasing starting from negative infinity and then it changes direction at negative two this is known as a local maximum or a relative max this is called a relative minimum and here is a relative maximum so it's increasing from negative infinity to negative two and then union it starts to increase again from at this point zero to two and then it's decreasing from negative two to zero and then union it decreases again starting from two and then based on this arrow it continues forever to infinity and so that's it you 

Transcript for: Even, Odd, or Neither Functions The Easy Way! - Graphs & Algebraically, Properties & Symmetry
in this video we're going to talk about how to tell if a function is even odd or neither we're going to talk about how to do it the easy way and also how to do it the way that your teacher wants you to do it so let's begin the first thing you need to know is how to tell if it's even a function is even if F of NE X is equal to F ofx so if you replace x with X and there's no change the new function that you get looks exactly like the original function then it's even now what about if it's odd it's odd if f ofx is equal toga F ofx so that is if you replace Negative X with X everything in the function every term has to change sign if one term changes sign and the rest do not it's not going to be odd now what about the last category when is a function neither even nor odd it's going to be neither if you plug in Negative X and if you do not get negative f ofx so what does that mean well let's say if you replace x with negative X and some signs change While others don't then it's going to be neither also if it doesn't equal F of X2 it's also neither so it can't equal negative f ofx or F ofx so basically as long as it's not even or odd it's neither so let's start with our first example let's say that f ofx is equal to x 4 + 3x^2 so is the function even odd or is it neither well here's how you do it the easy way look at the exponents is four even or odd four is an even number now what about two is it even or odd two is even so if all the exponents are even then the function is going to be even but now let's prove it let's show our work let's replace x with X so this is going to Bex raised to the 4th power + 3 * x^2 now what ISX raised to the 4 power that's basically x times itself four times x^2 ISX * itself 2 times two negatives is a positive three Nega will give you a negative result but four negatives will give you a positive result anytime you have an even number of negative signs it's going to produce a positive sign so this is going to be positive X 4th plus 3x^2 two negative signs will produce a positive result now notice that the function that we have is the same as the original function therefore this is equal to F ofx so we can make the statement that f ofx is equal to F ofx which is the definition of an even function now let's try our next example let's say that f ofx is equal to x to the 5th power + 2 x the 3 power is it even odd or neither now don't worry about the coefficient this is unimportant even though two is an even number that's not going to help us determine if it's even or odd look at the exponent five is it even or odd five is an odd number and three is also an odd number since all of the exponents are odd the function is going to be an odd function and now let's prove it let's replace x with negative X now whenever you have an odd number of negative signs the result will be negative for example x to the 3 powerx * X is POS x^2 time another Negative X that's X Cub so this is going to Bex to 5th power - 2x cub and all of that is equal to F ofx now what should we do in our next step in order to prove that this function is an odd function what you want to do is you want to factor out a Nega 1 if you take out 1X 5 /1 is postive x 5 all the signs will change -2X Cub will become posi 2x Cub now notice that this portion inside the brackets X 5th + 2x Cub is equal to the original function so at that point what you want to do is replace it with the original function f ofx so therefore we can say that f ofx is equal toga F ofx which is the definition of an odd function and that's how you can prove it now what about this one let's say that f ofx is equal to x^2 + 6 is it even or odd well you know X2 is an even component because it has an even exponent what about six well 6 is the same as 6 x to the 0 anything raised to the 0 power is one so X to Z is 1 which 6 * X to Z is 6 * 1 that's 6 and zero is an even exponent so the whole thing is going to be even so let's go ahead and prove it now let's replace x with negative X so this is going to be x^2 + 6 x * X is POS x^2 so we have x^2 + 6 notice that the function did not change so on the right side we can replace x^2 + 6 with f ofx on the left side we still have F of negx so whenever F of negx is equal to a positive F ofx then it's an even function so if you see a number it's even think of that number as being multiplied times x is z and Z is an even number like 2 4 6 what about X Cub - 8X is that even or is it odd well whenever you see an X it's basically x to the first power now one and three are odd numbers so therefore this is going to be an odd function now let's prove it so let's find find F ofx this ISX 3 power - 8 * xx^ the 3 power ISX Cub 8 * X is POS 8X so now notice that all signs change so to verify that it's odd take out a negative 1 if we factor out netive 1 is going to be positive X Cub - 8x and as we can clearly see X Cub - 8X is basically the same as F ofx so therefore f ofx is equal to F ofx which means that it's an odd function now what about this example x 3r - 5x^2 + 2 is it even or is it odd so notice that three is an odd exponent two is an even exponent whenever you see even and odd exponents together you know that it's going to be neither it's not even or odd so that's how you can tell when it's neither but let's prove it so let's plug in negative XX to the 3 power ISX Cub andx to the 2 power is POS x^2 so this is what we have now let's check to see if it's an even function if it's an even function right now the original function should be the same as a new function but notice that it's not the same the sign for X Cub changed but the sign for X2 and for two did not change so therefore it's not the same as the function so we can make the statement F ofx does not equal FX it's not even now to check to see if it's an odd function we need to take out or factor out negative 1 so all the signs will change Negative X Cub will become POS X Cub 5x^2 will become POS 5x^2 and 2 will become -2 now do we have the same function as the original function notice that these two are not the same X Cub looks very similar however NE 5x^2 is not the same as 5x^2 so therefore we can say that F ofx does not equal Nega F ofx which means that it's not an oddd function so so if it's not even and if it's not odd then by default it has to be neither so that's how you can prove if it's neither now let's spend a few moments talking about graphs an even function will be symmetric about the Y AIS an odd function is symmetric about the origin and if it's not symmetric about the origin or about the y- axis then it's neither so let's take a look at X2 because it has an even exponent we know it's an even function the graph of X2 looks like this it's basically a u let's do that again it's an upward u notice that there's symmetry about the Y AIS so that means that it's an even function now if you have a constant let's say like three that's an even function f ofx is the same as y by the way if you were to plot y equals 3am it's going to be a horizontal line at three and notice that this line is symmetric about the y- axis the left side looks exactly the same as the right side so therefore a constant by definition has even properties now what about the graph x Cub or Y y = XB we know it's an odd function this graph is an increasing function it looks like this as you can see there's symmetry about the origin this side in quadrant one looks exactly the same or it looks like a mirror image of the other side in quadrant 3 so that's an example of an odd function it's symmetric about the origin and then there's the graph f ofx = x or yal x to the first P one is an odd number but let's see why this function is odd using a graph so yal X is basically a line that increases at a 45° angle and as you can see it's symmetric about the origin the side in quadrant one looks like the same as the one in quadrant 3 so there symmetry about the origin which is the property of an odd function how would you describe a function that looks like this is it even odd or neither now here there's no symmetry about the X I mean about the Y AIS or the origin so this is neither now what about this one is it even odd or neither notice that the left side looks the same as the right side so therefore it's symmetric about the y- AIS which means that it's an even function here's another example for you determine if this one is even or if it's odd or if it's neither now it's not drawn perfectly to scale so use your good judgment so what would you say is it even odd or neither is it symmetrical about the Y AIS the origin or neither it's not symmetric about the y- axis the right side does not look the same as the left side however there is symmetry about the origin notice that quadrant 1 looks similar to quadrant 3 now this blue line could keep on going down so even though the height doesn't seem the same it can keep going in that direction and notice that Quadrant 4 looks like a reflection of quadrant 2 as you can see there symmetry about the origin which makes this function an odd function here's another one for you is this an even or is it an odd function so notice that the right side looks the same as the left side therefore it's an even function it's symmetric about the y- AIS what about this example is it even odd or is it neither well we know it's not even the right side does not look the same as the left side and it's not odd you can clearly see a difference between this section and this section it's not symmetric about the origin because quadrants uh four and quadrant 2 doesn't have the Symmetry about the origin they don't look the same so in this case this function would be uh neither it's neither even nor is it odd let's try one more example now what if we have let's say a circle let me draw better Circle it's not perfect but let's say it's it's a a well-rounded circle is it even odd or neither well the circle does have even properties as you can see the right side looks the same as the left side this whole side they're the same so there is symmetry about the Y AIS now what about about the origin is it um symmetric about the origin what would you say notice that the side in quadrant one looks like a reflection as the one in quadrant 3 so there's some symmetry about the origin and quadron 2 and four are symmetrical about the origin so this graph is symmetrical about the y axis and about the origin as well so that is does that make it even or odd now technically speaking we can't really say even or odd because it's not a function this function doesn't pass the vertical line test so we can't say it's an odd function it's not an even function maybe it's neither because it's not a function so think about that one 

Transcript for: Linear Functions
in this video i'm going to go over some basic questions relating to linear functions so let's start with this problem what is the slope of the line passing through the points 2 comma negative 3 and four comma five so to calculate the slope between two points you need to use this formula it's y two minus y one divided by x two minus x one the first number is x the second one is y so let's call two negative three x one y one and four comma five x two y two so y two in this example is five y one is negative three x two is four x 1 is 2. now 5 minus negative 3 is the same as 5 plus 3 and 5 plus 3 is 8 4 minus 2 is 2 and 8 divided by 2 is 4. so that's the slope that passes through these two points number two what is the slope and y-intercept of the line y equals two x minus three now you need to know that this equation is in slope intercept form which is y equals mx plus b so m represents the slope and b is the y-intercept so we could see that the slope is equal to 2 and the y-intercept is negative 3. and so that's it for this question now the y-intercept you can write it as an ordered pair if you want you could say it's zero negative three or simply the y-intercept is equal to negative three you can write it both ways but that's it for this problem number three graph the equations x equals two and y equals three so let's start with x equals two how can we graph this particular equation now whenever x is equal to a number the type of graph you're going to get it's going to be a line but specifically a vertical line at x equals 2. now for the other one y equals 3 the graph is simply a horizontal line where y is string and that's it that's all you need to do in order to graph these two equations number four graph the equation using the slope-intercept method so we have the equation y is equal to three x minus two so we could see that the slope is equal to three and a y-intercept is negative two i'm just going to write the ordered pair so we have the point zero negative two so here's the first point at zero negative two now the slope is 3 which represents the rise over the run so we need to rise three units and go over one unit to the right to get the next point so the next point is going to be at one comma one and then we could do it again rise three over one so the next point is going to be two comma four and then we can just connect these points with a straight line and so that's a rough estimate of the graph y equals three x minus two number five graph the equation two x minus three y is equal to six using the x and y-intercepts now to find the x-intercept replace y with zero negative three times zero is simply zero and so zero is nothing so this just disappears so 2x is equal to 6 and if we divide both sides by 2 we can see that x is equal to 3. so that's the x-intercept which means we have the point 3 comma 0. now to calculate the y-intercept we need to replace x with zero and solve for y so two times zero is nothing and so we have negative three y is equal to six and now let's divide both sides by negative three so then positive six excuse me divided by negative three that's negative two and so that's the y intercept so we have the point zero negative two at this point we can make the graph so the first point is three zero that's the x-intercept the next one is zero negative two that's the y-intercept and then just connect these two points with a straight line and it appears i missed it so there it is so that's how you can graph a linear equation in standard form there's three forms you need to be familiar with this is known as slope intercept form this is called standard form and then this equation is the point-slope form number six write the equation of the line passing through the point two comma five with a slope of three so whenever you're given the point and a slope it's best to use the point-slope formula to write the linear equation so x one is two y one is five and m is three so it's going to be y minus five is equal to three times x minus two so that's the linear equation in point slope form now let's convert it to slope intercept form so i'm going to distribute the three three times x that's three x and then it's three times negative two which is negative six so now let's add five to both sides negative six plus five is negative one so this is the linear equation in slope intercept form and that's the answer number seven write the equation of the line passing through the points negative three comma one and two comma negative four now we can't use the point slope formula yet because i don't have the slope so we need to calculate the slope first so it's y2 minus y1 divided by x2 minus x1 so this is going to be x1 and that's going to be y1 and this is x2 and y2 so y2 is negative 4 y1 is positive 1. x2 is 2 x one is negative three so negative four minus one is negative five two minus negative three is the same as two plus three that's five negative five divided by five is negative one so that's the slope it's equal to negative one now we can use the point slope formula so i'm going to use the first point negative three comma one so y minus y one is equal to m times x minus x one so y one is one m is negative one and x one is negative three so this is y minus one equals to negative x negative one times x plus three these two negative signs will become positive now let's distribute the negative one so it's going to be negative x minus three and then let's add one to both sides so y is equal to negative x and negative three plus one is negative two so this is the final answer it's negative x minus two number eight write the equation of the line passing through the point three negative two and parallel to the line two x plus five y minus three so what you need to know is that parallel lines have the same slope so if the slope here is two then the slope of the other line will also be 2. so we already have the point passing through or that's part of that line we need to find the slope of this line which will be the slope of the line of the equation that we're looking to find so let's turn this equation and change it into its slope intercept form so first i'm going to move the 3 to this side so it's going to be positive 3 on the right side and then i'm going to take the 2x move it to that side where it's going to be negative 2x so i have 5y is equal to negative 2x plus 3 and then divide every term by 5. so y is equal to negative two over five times x plus three over five so the slope of this line is the number in front of x when it's in slope intercept form so the slope is negative two over five so now i can use the point slope formula to write the equation of the line so this is going to be x1 and y1 so y one that's negative two m is negative two over five x one is three so this is gonna be y plus 2 and then let's distribute the negative 2 over 5 to x minus 3. now negative 2 over 5 times negative 3 negative 2 times negative 3 is 6. so this is going to be 6 over 5. and now let's subtract both sides by two now two over one i'm going to multiply this by five over five to get common denominators so negative 2 is the same as negative 10 over 5. now 6 minus 10 is 4. so this is going to be negative 4 over 5. and this is the answer so that's the equation of the line in slope-intercept form number nine write the equation of the line passing through the point negative four negative three and perpendicular to the line three x minus four y plus five so first we need to find the slope of this equation so let's get y by itself i'm going to move the 3x and the 5 to the other side so it's going to be negative 3x and negative 5 on the right side now i need to divide each term by negative four so y is equal to three over four times x plus five over four whenever you divide two negative numbers you're going to get a positive result so the slope of this line is 3 over 4. now let's say if we have two lines line k and line out and let's say that these two lines are perpendicular which means that they meet at right angles or at a 90 degree angle now let's say that the slope of line k is 2 over 5. what do you think is the slope of line l perpendicular lines have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of each other so this slope is positive the other one will be negative and then you need to flip the fraction so the reciprocal of two over five is five over two and so that tells us that these two lines are perpendicular so the slope for this equation is three over four so therefore the slope of the perpendicular line that we want to find is going to be the negative reciprocal of that fraction which is negative four divided by three now let's finish this problem so let's use the point slope formula so x1 is going to be negative 4 y1 is negative 3. so it's going to be y minus negative 3 and the slope is negative 4 over 3 and then x1 is negative 4. so this becomes y plus 3 and that's equal to negative 4 divided by 3 times x plus 4. so that's the answer in point slope form now let's distribute the negative 4 over 3. let's convert it to slope intercept form so this is going to be negative 4 over 3 times x and then negative 4 times 4 is negative 16. now let's subtract both sides by three now we need to get common denominators so i'm going to multiply this 3 by 3 over 3 so it becomes negative 9 over 3. negative 16 minus 9 is negative twenty five so this is the final answer it's negative four over three x minus twenty five over three you 

Transcript for: How To Graph Absolute Value Functions - Domain & Range
in this lesson we're going to talk about how to graph absolute value functions using transformations so this is going to be the parent function of the absolute value of x so basically it's a graph that looks like a v pointing in the upward direction now if you want to plot it using points here's what you need to do the center is zero so you want to choose two points to the right and two points to the left and then plug in the numbers to find the y value the absolute value of zero is zero the absolute value of one is the same thing it's one the absolute value of negative one is positive one and the absolute value of negative two is positive soon and then you can plot the points if you do that you're going to get a graph that looks like this now what about the absolute value of negative x let's say if the negatives on the outside how would the graph look like if the negative is on the outside it's going to reflect over the x-axis so instead of opening in the upward direction it's going to open downward now what if the negative is on the inside if it's on the inside doesn't matter it's still going to open upward the absolute value of any negative number will produce a positive result for example if you plug in positive 1 absolute value of negative one will still be positive one so the negative on the inside will not cause the graph to open downward but the negative on the outside will now what are the domain and range of these two functions the domain represent all of the possible x values as you can see x can be anything the lowest x value all the way to the left is negative infinity and the highest is infinity so it's all real numbers for the domain you can plug in any value into x now what about the range the domain for the other one is the same by the way it's negative infinity to infinity that's going to be true for all absolute value functions if there's no fractions no radicals no logarithmic equations it's going to be all numbers now as for the range what's the lowest y value that we see in the graph on the left notice that it goes down towards negative infinity and the highest y value is zero so the range is from negative infinity to zero now for the graph on the right the lowest y value is zero the highest is infinity so the range is from zero to infinity and zero is included so we need to use a bracket instead of a parenthesis now what about graphing an equation that looks like this this graph is going to shift two units to the left and so it's going to open upward because it's a positive outside of the absolute value function now if you want to plot points need to realize that the slope is 1. so once you plot the vertex as you travel one unit to the right go up one unit so that will take you to the point negative one one and as you travel one unit to left go up one because the slope is one on the right side the slope is positive one but on the left side the slope is negative one and then to find the next point travel one to the right and up one and the left side is just going to be reflection of the right side so the graph is going to look like this if there was a 2 in front the slope would be 2 it would the graph would be like more steeper so to speak it would be narrow and not as wide now what about the graph for this one x minus three this one is going to shift three units to the right and it's still going to open in the upward direction with a slope of one now what about the absolute value of x plus two and also negative absolute value of x minus 3. what's going to happen to the graph in the first example it's going to shift up 2 units and because we have a plus sign in front it's going to open in the upward direction for the second example it's going to shift down three units that's a vertical shift left and right represents a horizontal shift and it's going to open downward due to the negative sign now what are the range for the graph for each of these let's start with the first one what's the range notice that the lowest y value is 2 the highest is infinity so the range is going to be from 2 to infinity and 2 is included now for the one on the right the lowest y value is negative infinity the highest is negative three and negative three is included so the range is from negative infinity to negative three you start from the low y value and you stop at the highest y value and there's no breaks in between so what if we have a combination of transformations let's say this graph so it's going to shift two units to the right and up three units so here's the vertex and it's going to open upward with a slope of one to the right and with a slope of negative one to the left by the way for those of you who prefer to use tables here's what you want to do if you set the inside part equal to zero this will give you the x coordinate of the vertex which is two after that you want to make that your center point choose two points to the right of two and two points to the left and find the y values at those points when you plug in two y is going to be three when you plug in three the absolute value of three minus two is one plus three that's going to be four if you plug in one it's gonna be the same thing if you plug in four four minus two is two plus three is five if you plug in 0 you're going to get the same thing and once you plot it you're going to get a graph that looks like this the domain for that graph is all real numbers but the range the lowest y value is 3 the highest is infinity so the range is going to be 3 to infinity try this one 4 minus the absolute value of x plus 1. so the graph is going to shift one unit to the left and it's going to shift up four units so the vertex is at the point negative one comma four and the slope the number in front of the absolute value function is one and because there's a negative sign in front of it we know it's going to open in a downward direction but let's plot points though to get the next point as you travel one unit to the right you need to go down one same thing one to the left go down one and then one to the right go down one again and just repeat the process and so this is going to be a rough sketch of the graph and i missed all the points there so that's how you can graph it if you want to draw a more accurate sketch using points and as we can see the range is from negative infinity to four the highest y value is four and don't forget to put brackets because it includes four let's try one more example so let's graph this one so this time the slope is going to be 2. the graph is going to shift one unit to the right and it's going to shift up three units so it starts at the point one three as we travel one to the right we need to go up two units on the y axis so the next point is over here one to the left we need to go up two units and as we travel uh one more unit to the right and one to the left we need to go up two more units but i'm out of space so i'm just gonna have to go with this because i'm out of space let's do one more example so let's say if we have five minus three x minus one so i'm going to put this over here and draw a bigger graph this time so as we travel one unit to the right we need to go up five units based on this it shifts one to the right horizontally and vertically up five units so the first point is that one comma five now we have a slope of three and because it's negative we know it's going to open downward so as we travel one unit to the right needs to go down three units five minus three is two so that will take us to the point two comma two and then one to the left we need to go down three units so that's the point zero two and then if we go one more to the right we need to go down three units two minus three is negative one so we'll get this point here and another one here and if we go one more to the right and one to left we need to go down three more units so the graph is going to look something like this so now you know how to graph absolute value functions 

Transcript for: Graphing Quadratic Functions Using a Data Table | Algebra
now let's talk about how to graph quadratic functions using a table so let's start with y is equal to x squared for this graph we know that the vertex is going to be at zero it's centered at the origin so what you need to do is pick two points to the right of the vertex and two points to the left the left side is going to have the same y values as the right side for instance if you plug in 1 1 squared and negative 1 squared they both equal the same thing positive 1. if you plug in 2 squared you're going to get 4. if you plug in negative 2 squared you're going to get negative 4. because they're equally distant about the vertex these two points will have the same y value and the other two points will also have the same y value and then you could plot it so the vertex is at the origin we have the point one one and negative one comma one and then we have the point two four and negative two four and then we can graph it now what is the domain of this function and what's the range the domain is all of the possible x values all the values that x can be and for quadratic functions there's no limitation on x x can be anything so it's going to be from negative infinity to infinity it's all real numbers if you analyze the graph from the left side x the graph starts all the way from the left and it keeps going towards the right as it travels to the right it keeps going up now the range has restrictions the range represents all of the y values the lowest y value is zero and the highest is infinity so therefore the range is from zero to infinity and since zero is included we're going to use brackets for parentheses i mean for infinity you should always use parentheses the vertex for this graph is the origin 0 0 and what is the axis of symmetry sometimes you might get questions on this the axis of symmetry is basically the x coordinate of the vertex it's x equals 0. if you draw the axis of symmetry notice that the right side is symmetric across that line now anytime a graph opens upward it has a minimum value the minimum value is basically the y coordinate of the vertex the lowest y value is zero now let's talk about graphing a quadratic function in vertex form using a table in vertex form here's the general equation y is equal to a x minus h squared plus k the vertex is h comma k so let's make a table the first thing we want to do is find the coordinates of the vertex so you got to change this sign if you see a one it make a negative one whatever sign is out here don't change it the vertex is negative one negative three now choose two points to the right of the vertex and two points to the left and then find the y values now keep in mind negative two and zero because they're equally distant from the vertex they will share the same y values the same is true for negative three and one that's why you want to set it up this way it requires less work to graph it so let's plug in zero when x is 0 what is the value of y 1 squared is 1 1 minus 3 is negative 2. so when x is 0 or negative 2 y is going to be negative 2. now what about when x is one one plus one is two two squared is four and four minus three is one so that's it now let's go ahead and graph it let's start with the vertex which is negative one negative three then we have the point zero negative two and negative two negative two next is one one and negative three one so that's the graph now go ahead and find the domain the range the axis of symmetry the maximum or the minimum value and that's about it so the domain for any quadratic functions is all real numbers negative infinity to infinity now for the range let's identify the lowest y value which is basically the y coordinate of the vertex it's negative three and the highest is infinity so the range is from negative three to infinity including negative three the axis of symmetry is simply the x coordinate of the vertex so the aos is x is equal to negative one that's how you write it and because the graph opens upward there's going to be a minimum value which is the y coordinate of the vertex the minimum value is negative three the location of the minimum value is x equals negative one the x value represents the location the y value represents the minimum value or sometimes the maximum value if the graph opens downward now let's work on one more example let's say that y is equal to negative x squared plus four x plus one so this time we have a quadratic function in standard form let's graph it using a data table so the first thing we need to do is find the vertex the x coordinate of the vertex is negative b over 2a it's very useful to use this equation if you have the quadratic function in standard form b is the number in front of x which is 4. a is a number in front of x squared if you don't see one it's a 1 but since we have a negative sign it's negative one so negative four divided by negative two is positive two so that's the x coordinate of the vertex now choose two x values to the right of two and two to the left now let's plug in the vertex into this equation first so negative two squared plus four times two plus one that's negative four plus eight plus one which is four plus one that's five so that's the y coordinate of the vertex now let's plug in one one and three will have the same y value but it's easier to deal with one rather than three negative one squared is negative one four times one is four negative one and one cancels so it's gonna be four and that's gonna be the same thing now if we plug in zero zero squared is zero four times zero is zero plus one the whole thing is one so that's what we're gonna have now we can go ahead and graph at this point so the vertex is at two comma five the next point is that one four and we have one at three four and then zero one and four one and so we're going to get a nice symmetric graph as long as we pick two points to the right of the vertex and two points to the left now the domain is going to be everything negative infinity to infinity go ahead and find the range the axis of symmetry and then the maximum or minimum values the range let's see the lowest y value for the range is negative infinity and the highest is 5 which is the y coordinate of the vertex so the range is from negative infinity to positive five and it includes five so we're gonna put a bracket there the axis of symmetry is the x coordinate of the vertex which is two so it's x equals two and here it is now because the graph opens downward it's not going to have a minimum value rather it's going to have a maximum value the maximum value is the y coordinate of the vertex so it's five and so that's it for this lesson you 

Transcript for: Graphing Piecewise Functions - Precalculus
in this tutorial we're going to focus on graphing piecewise functions so let's start with this particular example f of x is equal to x when x is less than zero and it's equal to five when x is equal to or greater than zero now let's graph these two functions separately so we can get an idea of what they look like so the graph f of x equals x or y equals x is basically a straight line with a slope of one so it rises at a 45 degree angle so that's y equals x now the second graph f of x equals five or y equals five it looks like this it's a horizontal line at five now we only need this portion of the graph when x is less than zero and we need this portion of the graph when x is greater than or equal to zero so the piecewise function is going to combine the left side of this graph with the right side of that graph so let's put it all together so when x is less than zero but not including zero we're going to have to graph y equals x so i'm going to put an open circle at zero because it does include zero but it's going to look like y equals x on the left side now on the right side it looks like y equals five but it includes zero so i'm going to use a closed circle at 5. so keep in mind the y value there is 5. and that's how you can graph this particular piecewise function let's work on another example so let's say that f of x is equal to two when x is less than one and it's equal to x plus three when x is greater than two so feel free to pause the video and try this example so it's equal to two when x is greater than one i mean when x is less than one i take that back and it doesn't include uh one itself it's less than one not equal to one so we're going to have a an open circle at one comma two and because it's just a constant it's going to be a horizontal line but less than one so we got to graph it to the left now at two we're gonna have the graph x plus three now this particular graph has a y intercept of three and it has a slope of one so it has these points so when x is 2 this graph is going to be at 5. so it's going to be up here already and then it's just going to increase at a 45 degree angle with a slope of so i'm running out of space but this is how the graph is going to look like if we take this part out so this has a y value of five we don't have any closed circles in this example because there's no underline with the inequality it's just x is less than one or greater than two here's another example let's say that f of x is equal to two x plus one when x is less than one and it's equal to one when x is equal to one and it has a value of negative x squared when x is greater than one so let's start with this so when x is one if we plug in one into this expression that's going to be two times one plus one so that's going to give us the point one comma three and that's going to be an open circle because it does include one now this graph it has a slope of two and a y-intercept of 1. keep in mind it's a linear equation in the form y equals mx plus b so the number in front of x is the slope and this number is the y-intercept so we also have this point when x is zero y is one so we can say this graph looks like this we can only plot the left side of the graph where x is less than one now here when x equals one y is one so that's just a point we don't have a straight line there's no range of x values it's just one single x value so we got the point one comma one so when x is one y is one so this can be a closed circle right here now when x is greater than one we have the graph negative x squared positive x squared looks like this it's a parabola that opens upward and what do you think negative x squared looks like this is a parabola that opens downward so if we plug in a 1 into this expression that's going to give us negative 1. so it's going to have a point in this region but we're going to use an open circle because this doesn't include one now when x is 2 this will be negative 2 squared which will be negative 4. and that should be somewhere down here so it's going to look something like this we need to give it a curved shape it won't be a straight line and so that's the general shape of this particular piecewise function as long as you take your time graph it step by step you should be fine it's not that difficult but let's work on some more examples so let's say that f of x is three x plus four when x is less than zero it's equal to two when x is equal to zero and then it's equal to the square root of x when x is greater than one so go ahead and take a minute and try that so let's start with this so once again we have a linear equation y is equal to mx plus b m is 3 and b is 4. so the y intercept is form when x is 0 y is 4. so we're going to have an open circle at 0 comma four now we can only graph the left side of that function so if we plot the point x equals negative one the y value will be one three times negative one plus four that's negative three plus four so that's one so we got the point negative one comma one also you could use the slope the slope is three so if you go backwards you need to go one into left down three that'll give you the point one comma one so this graph looks like this when plotting a linear equation or linear function you only need two points to graph it and then connect it with a straight line now let's focus on the next part so when x is zero y is two so we got the point zero comma two and that's going to be a closed circle let me put that in red and then when x is greater than one we have the square root of x so if we plug in one into the square root of x function the square root of one is one so we got the point one comma one but we need to use an open circle it doesn't include one and then the next point i would plug in to this expression is four because the square root of 4 is 2 so that will give us the point 4 comma 2. and so the square root function looks like that it's an increase in function that increases at a decreasing rate it increases slowly and so this is the piecewise function that we have for this particular example now let's try one last example so let's say that f of x is one over x when x is less than zero it's equal to three when x is between zero and three and it's equal to negative x plus five when x is equal to or greater than three so one over x looks like this it's negative on the left side but positive on the right side so that's the graph of one over x now we only need a portion where x is less than zero so we only need that portion of the graph so let's get rid of this stuff on the right now between zero and three the y value will be equal to three so it includes x equals zero we're going to have a closed circle here but it doesn't include x equals three so i'm going to put an open circle at this point so it's a straight line at three at a y value of three now when x is equal to or greater than three we have negative x plus five so if we plug in three into that expression it's going to be negative three plus five which is 2 so we're going to have a closed circle at 3 comma 2. now the next point if we plug in 4 negative 4 plus 5 is 1. we can see why it's going down because it has a slope of negative one if we plug in five negative five plus five will be zero so that will be the x intercept of this piecewise function and so we can see it's going down like that and so that's it for this example you 

Transcript for: How To Graph Polynomial Functions Using End Behavior, Multiplicity & Zeros
in this video we're going to talk about how to graph polynomial functions using things such as end behavior multiplicity and even finding the zeros so let's begin by taking down some notes first let's begin our discussion with the graph of y equals positive x squared so this is an even function with a degree of two even functions are symmetrical about the y axis and so this is the shape of the y equals x squared graph the end behavior towards the left is up and the end behavior towards the right is up now there's other ways in which you can describe the end behavior of this graph on the right side as x approaches positive infinity y approaches positive infinity so here's how you can visualize it as you move towards the right along the x-axis as you go towards positive infinity the values along the y-axis are increasing you're going up towards positive infinity on the y-axis now the end behavior for this graph on the left as x approaches negative infinity y approaches positive infinity as we go to the left we can see the y values are increasing so this is another way in which you can describe the end behavior of that graph now let's consider another example in this case it's going to be y equals negative x squared now this is also an even function so we're going to have symmetry along the y-axis but we have a negative sign the leading coefficient is negative so this is going to reflect over the x-axis so the graph is going to look like this as we could see the end behavior on the left is down and it's also down on the right but we can express it this way just like before so on the left side as x approaches positive infinity that is as we go towards the right what happens to the y value well we could see that the y value is decreasing it's becoming more negative so it's approaching negative infinity so that's the end behavior i put left this should be on the right side because x is going towards positive infinity so that's the end behavior towards the right side now towards the left side that is when x goes to negative infinity so we're going towards the left notice what's happening to the y values they're also becoming more negative so y is approaching negative infinity so that's one way in which you could describe the end behavior of a particular graph now for the sake of practice go ahead and describe the end behavior for these two graphs y equals positive x cubed and y equals negative x cubed and i'll give you the shape of these graphs so positive x cubed looks like this it starts from the bottom and then let me draw this better it curves towards zero it's actually almost horizontal at the origin and then it goes back up so right here you have like a horizontal tangent now for y equals negative x squared it reflects about the origin so it looks like that and we still have that same horizontal tangent where it touches the x-axis so go ahead and describe the left and the right end behavior for these two graphs so let's start with the left side as x approaches negative infinity what happens to y well as we go towards the left we can see that the y values are becoming more negative y approaches negative infinity now for the right side as x goes to positive infinity y goes up it goes towards positive infinity as well so that's the end behavior for positive x cubed now let's do the same for negative x cubed as x approaches negative infinity what happens to y as we go towards the left the y values are increasing in the positive y direction so it goes towards positive infinity it's going up and for the right end behavior as x approaches positive infinity as we move towards the right side we can see that the curve is going down so y approaches negative infinity so now let's put everything together let's start with the even functions so y equals positive x squared what you need to know is that the end behavior is up up now the same is true for y is equal to positive x to the fourth this graph looks similar the end behavior is up on the left and up on the right so anytime you have a polynomial with an even degree and a positive leading coefficient the end behavior will be up up now if we have negative x squared that does not look like a 2 let's do that again the end behavior is going to be down on the left and down on the right so i'm just going to use d to represent down now for y equals negative x to the fourth the situation is similar it's going to be down on the left and down on the right as well so anytime you have an even exponent it's either up up or down down the difference is based on the sign of the leading coefficient if it's negative it's down down but if the lean coefficient is positive it's going to be up up now let's consider the examples where the exponent is odd so going back to positive x cubed the end behavior is down on the left up on the right now this is similar to y is equal to positive x to the first power but this is going to be a straight line but the end behavior is still the same it's down on the left up on the right so anytime the exponent is odd the end behavior is going to alternate it's going to be either down up or up down if the leading coefficient is positive it's going to go from down to up so it's going to be increasing now if the leading coefficient is negative we're going to get the reverse situation so instead of going from down up it's now going to be up and then it's going to go down and the same is true for y equals negative x to the first power it's a straight line but it's going to go in this direction it's initially up on the left but it's going to be down on the right so now let's summarize this in a table you may want to write this down so when the exponent or the overall degree of the polynomial function is even and if the leading coefficient is positive the end behavior will be up up if we have a degree that's even but the leading coefficient is negative then it's going to be down down that's the end behavior now if we have an odd degree with a positive leading coefficient it's going to be down at first and then it's going to be up if it's odd or negative it's going to be up and then down now let's talk about the behavior of the graph near an x-intercept i'm going to explain this more late in this video but for now you want to write this down so let's say the multiplicity of a particular x-intercept or particular zero is one this is going to look like the graph y equals x to the first power so at that zero it's simply just gonna cross the x axis basically in a straight line now the angle of the straight line can vary so you don't have to be too specific about that if the multiplicity is 2 it's going to look like the graph y equals x squared it's not gonna cross the x-axis but it's going to touch or bounce on the x-axis much in a similar way to the graph y equals x squared if the multiplicity is 3 for a particular 0 or x-intercept it's going to look similar to x cube but at at that x intercept so if you think of the graph of x cube it looks something like this so you're going to have that same shape here but you're going to have the behavior at that 0 is going to be horizontal so make sure you understand that if the multiplicity is 1 the behavior at the x intercept is going to be like a straight line it's going to cross the x axis in a straight line if the multiplicity is 2 at that x-intercept it's not going to cross the x-axis but it's going to bounce on you know that point and then if the multiplicity is 3 it's going to cross the x axis but not in a straight line but rather with a horizontal tangent so now let's work on some example problems consider the polynomial function y is equal to x plus 2 times x minus 1 squared times x minus 4. so we're given a polynomial function not in standard form but in factored form how can we graph this particular function well the first thing we need to do is we need to identify the zeros that is the x-intercepts so we're going to set y equal to 0 and we're going to solve for x so in this equation what are the possible solutions according to the zero product property in order to solve it we need to set each factor equal to zero if one of these factors is zero the entire expression on the right side will equal zero because zero times anything is zero so we're gonna set x plus two equal to zero we're gonna set x minus one equal to zero and x minus four for the first equation if we subtract two from both sides we'll get that x is equal to negative 2. for the second one if we add 1 to both sides we'll find that x is equal to positive 1. and here we just need to add 4 to both sides and then we'll get x is equal to four so that's how we could find the zeros or the x-intercepts of the polynomial function so all we need to do to quickly find the zeros is simply replace the sign if you see x plus two the zero is going to be negative two if you see x minus one the intercept is going to be positive one here x minus four just change negative four to positive four and that will give you the x-intercepts now the next thing we need is the multiplicity of each zero the multiplicity is going to be equal to the exponent of each factor so for this zero the multiplicity is going to be what we see here positive one for the factor x minus one or for the zero x equals one the multiplicity is going to be two and for the last one it's 1. and so now we have everything that we need in order to graph this polynomial function so let's go four units to the left and four units to the right so the first x-intercept on the left is that negative two the second one is at positive one and the last one is at four now there's one more thing that we need we need to determine the overall degree of the polynomial to find the overall degree simply add the exponents one plus two plus one is four so we have a degree four polynomial if you were to foil this entire expression the first term will be x to the fourth and it's positive all of the signs here in front of x are positive so we have a polynomial with an even degree and a positive leading coefficient what is the end behavior for this polynomial if it's even it's either up up or down down because this is positive the end behavior will be up up so let's put an up arrow above the first x-intercept and another up arrow above the last one so now we're going to sketch the graph from one arrow we're going to try to connect it to the other arrow so let's approach the first x-intercept now what is the behavior of the curve at this x-intercept in order to find the the behavior around that x-intercept we need to look at the multiplicity the multiplicity is one so the behavior is going to be similar to y equals x to the first power all we're going to do is draw a straight line through that x-intercept it's going to be linear at that point so because the multiplicity is 1 we're simply going to cross the x-axis now we need to turn towards the next x-intercept which is that positive one for this one the multiplicity is two so think of the graph y equals x squared the behavior of the curve at the x-intercept going to look like this so therefore we're going to bounce off the x-intercept so we're going to draw something that looks like a y equals x squared graph there but upside down and now for the last x-intercept the multiplicity is one so we're going to cross the x-axis with a straight line and so that's it that's how we can graph for this particular polynomial function now the only thing we don't know is how low the peak is or how high it is and the only way to get a good idea of the heights of those peaks is to plug in numbers so we're gonna try negative 1 and positive 2. and let's see what the y values are for those numbers so let's plug in negative 1 into the original expression so we're going to have negative 1 plus 2 and then negative one minus one squared and then negative one minus four negative one plus two is one negative one minus one is negative two and negative one minus four is negative five negative two squared is positive four four times negative five is negative twenty so that's the y value for that point now let's see what it is for two so this is going to be two plus two to the first power two minus one to the second power and then two minus four two plus two is four two minus one is one two i feel like i'm missing something here two minus negative four is negative two so for this one we get negative eight which is not as low as negative twenty let's try this one let's try one actually you know what i put the wrong number i take that back i see the mistake i made this is 3 and this intercept should be 4. so this should be 3 plus two and then three minus one squared and then three minus four three plus two is five three minus one is two three minus four is negative one two squared times four times negative one that's negative twenty okay so these two peaks are of the same height for this particular example and you can see why there's symmetry so to speak these two zeros have the same multiplicity and the distance between these two x-intercepts they're the same so due to the fact that this graph is symmetric about x equals 1 we can see why these two values are the same now this is not going to be the case for every other example it's just for this particular example so the best way to determine the relative heights of the peaks is simply to plug in numbers in this case they just happen to be the same 

Transcript for: How To Graph Radical Functions & Determine The Domain and Range
now in this lesson we're going to talk about how to graph radical functions particularly using transformations so here's the parent function of the square root of x and increases at a decrease in rate and it travels towards quadrant one now what if we put let's say a negative sign in front of it what's going to happen if we put a negative sign this is going to flip over the x-axis it reflects over the x-axis now what if we put a negative on the inside of the radical what's going to happen now relative to the original function it's going to reflect over the y-axis and this is the y-axis this is the x-axis if we have a negative on the outside and on the inside then relative to the parent function it's going to reflect over the origin so it's going to look like that now if you ever forget these things this is something that can help you this is what i use the sign that's in front of x i'm going to associate it with x the sign outside of the radical i'm going to associate it with y when x is positive you need to travel towards the right and when y is positive you need to go up which leads you to towards quadrant one now in the second example x is positive but y is negative so x is positive towards the right y is negative going down so this will take you towards quadrant four and this is quadrant one now on the third example x is negative y is positive x is negative towards the left y is positive as you go up this will take you towards quadrant two and in the last example x is negative and y is negative so that will take you towards quadrant three so you can use the signs to help determine in what direction the graph is going to travel towards now let's say if we have the square root of x minus two what's the general shape of the graph what's going to happen this graph is going to shift two units to the right if you set the inside part equal to zero x is equal to 2. that's going to be the new origin 2 comma 0. and it's going to go that one since there's a positive sign in front of the x and in front of the y so let's say if we had square root x plus three this graph will be shifted three units to the left and it's going to travel towards quadrant one now what about this one the square root of x plus one so this graph is going to go up one unit and it's going to open towards the right and if we have let's say negative square root x minus 2 this graph is gonna shift down to now instead of going towards quadrant one it's going to be reflected so it's going to go towards quadrant four it's gonna look like that due to the negative sign go ahead and graph this function the square root of x minus one plus two and also determine the domain and the range of the function so this graph is going to shift one unit to the right and up two units so the new origin is that one comma two now to find the next two points here's what you can do the parent function is the square root of x the square root of one is one so as you travel one unit to the right go up one to get the next point so that's going to be two comma three now the square root of four is equal to two so as you travel four units to the right go up two units to get the next point so this is going to be five comma three and so this is how the graph is going to look like now what's the domain and range of this graph so let's start with the domain the domain has to do with the x values the lowest x value is one the highest is infinity so the domain is going to be one to infinity and since it includes 1 we need to use a bracket now the range is associated with the y values the lowest y value is 2 the highest will be infinity so the range is from 2 to infinity let's try another example let's graph the square root of three minus x plus one so if we set the inside equal to zero we can see that x is equal to three that means that it's going to shift three units to right and because of the plus one it's gonna shift up one now we need to know what direction to go towards that is towards quadrant one towards quadrant two three or four it's going to be in one of those directions so here's how we can tell we have a negative sign in front of x and a positive sign next to y so x is negative it's going to go towards the left and y is positive it's going to go up so it's going to go in that general direction now we know that the square root of one is one so what that tells us is that as we travel one unit to the left because we need to go to the left the graph is going to go up one unit so the next point is the point positive two two now as we travel four to the left the square root of four is two it needs to go up 2 units so that will take us to the point negative 1 comma 3. and so the graph let's do that again it's going to look something like that so what's the domain and range of this function the lowest x value is negative infinity and the highest history so therefore the domain is going to be from negative infinity to 3. you always want to write it from left to right from the low x value to the highest x value now the range the lowest y value is 1 and the highest is infinity so from the lowest to the highest value it's going to be from 1 to infinity and so that's how you can write the domain and range of a radical function let's try one more example let's say y is equal to 3 minus the square root of 4 minus x feel free to graph this problem and let's put a 2 in front of the radical so first let's set four minus x equal to zero so x is four that means that the origin shifts four units to the right and because we have a plus three in front it's gonna shift up three units so the graph starts at four comma three that's the new origin now what direction is it going to travel towards towards quadrant one two three or towards quadrant 4. so we have a negative sign in front of x which means it's going to go towards the left and we have a negative sign in front of the radical which means negative y which is going to go down so it's going to go towards quadrant 3. so now that we have the direction let's go ahead and get some points now because we have a 2 in front of it everything is doubled when x changes by one y will change by two when x changes by four y will change by 4 as well so be careful with these things and if x were to change by 9 y will change by 6. so as we travel let's say one unit to the left we need to go down two units because of this instead of going down one we have to go down two the two is gonna double the change in the y value so this will take us to the point three one now as we travel four units to the left relative to the new origin the y value will decrease by four so four units will take us to an x value of zero we need to go down four which will take us to a y value of negative one so here's the next point and as we travel let's say 9 units to the left we need to go down six units so that's going to take us to the point negative five negative three so now let's go ahead and graph it now what is the domain and range of the function starting with the domain the lowest x value is negative infinity and the highest x value it stops at positive four so it's from negative infinity to four now as for the range the lowest y value is negative infinity and the highest history so it's negative infinity to three and so that's it for this example now i'm going to do one more example for those of you who like to use a table let's try this 2 square root x plus 1 minus 3. so we can see that the graph is going to shift one unit to the left and down three units so the new origin is at negative one negative three so let's plot that point first now you wanna choose x values that will lead to a perfect square so once you have your new origin the next x value that you want should be one unit away from the origin so one unit away from negative one is zero and we know that this graph is going to go towards quadrant one because x and y are both positive so you want to choose one point to the right of negative one then you want to travel four units to the right of negative one which will take you to an x value of three and if you want another point travel nine units to the right of negative one which will lead you to eight negative one plus nine is eight the reason why you want to do this is because one four and nine are perfect squares if we replace x with zero zero plus one is one the square root of one is one times two is two two minus three will give us a y value of negative one if we plug in three three plus one is four the square root of four is two times two is four minus three this is going to be one if we plug in eight a plus one is nine square root of nine is three three times two is six six minus three is three and now all we need to do is simply plot the points so the next point is zero negative one and then it's a three comma one and then eight comma three so this graph looks something like this and so the domain the lowest x value we see is negative 1 the highest is infinity the domain is going to be from negative 1 to infinity and as for the range the lowest y value is negative 3 the highest is positive infinity so it's from negative 3 to infinity and that's it 

Transcript for: Graphing Rational Functions Using Transformations With Vertical and Horizontal Asymptotes
in this video we're going to focus on graphing rational functions using transformations so let's start with this function 1 over x the curve exists in quadrants 1 and three so this is quadrant one and here we have quadrant two this is quadrant three and this is quadrant four now what are the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of this graph the vertical asymptote is basically the y-axis the vertical asymptote is x is equal to zero you could find it by setting the denominator equal to zero so that's the vertical asymptote the horizontal asymptote is the x-axis and is equal to the equation is y is equal to zero now what about the graph negative one over x how is it different from the graph on the left the only difference is it reflects over the origin so to speak well technically you can see it as a reflection over the y axis this side switches to this side which we can see it here and this side switches over here you can also describe it as a reflection over the x-axis because if you take this side and move it here it looks like this portion the vertical asymptote and the horizontal asymptote are the same for these two graphs so what's the domain and the range for the graph on the left the domain includes all possible x values the only thing that you need to remove from the domain in this example is the vertical asymptote which is x equals 0. if you plug in zero the function is undefined that's why the curve does not exist there so the domain includes every x value except zero so it's from negative infinity to zero union 0 to infinity now for the range you need to remove the horizontal asymptote so the range is going to be the same as the domain so as we've seen in the last example 1 over x and negative 1 over x were symmetric about the origin which means they're odd functions now what about this graph 1 over x squared and also negative 1 over x squared what do you think the general shape for these two graphs will look like so these two graphs still have a vertical asymptote at x equals 0 and also a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero but they're going to be even functions they're symmetric about the y axis which is the vertical asymptote so the first one is going to exist above the x axis because 1 over x squared is always positive if you were to replace x with negative 5 and then square it that would be positive 25 so it's always going to be positive or above the x-axis negative one over x squared it's going to reflect over the x-axis but as you can see it's still symmetric about the y-axis which means that these two functions are even functions the domain for both graphs will be the same it's negative infinity to zero union zero to infinity so the way you find a domain is you start from the left side negative infinity and the graph continues all the way to the right side however it doesn't touch zero as you can see there's the red line never intersects the x value of zero it never touches the y axis so you have to remove zero from the domain now the range of these two functions are not the same what is the range for the first one so when dealing with the range you have to look at the y values the lowest y value is zero the highest is infinity so the range is going to be zero to infinity and it does not include zero so you need to use parentheses instead of brackets now what about the range for the graph on the right notice that the lowest y value is negative infinity and the highest is zero so it's going to be negative infinity to zero that's the range and zero is not included what about this graph one over x plus two how can we graph it this graph is going to look similar to one over x but it's going to shift two units to left if you set the denominator equal to zero you'll see that x is equal to negative two that is the vertical asymptote so let's plot that first and we know that one over x exists in quadrants one and four so relative to the vertical asymptote is going to exist in the upper right section and the lower left section so that's going to be the graph of one over x plus two using transformations now if you want to get an accurate sketch you can plug in points but my focus is not that in this lesson i just want to focus on the general shape so now that we have the general shape what's the domain and what's the range so the lowest x value is negative infinity the highest is infinity and we have to take out the vertical asymptote negative two because if the vertical asymptote is negative two that means in the function x cannot equal negative two it will be undefined because you'll get a zero in the denominator so the domain is going to be from negative infinity to negative two union negative two to infinity and the horizontal asymptote is still y equals zero it hasn't changed which means that y varies from negative infinity to positive infinity but it doesn't include the horizontal asymptote the curve doesn't touch it so the range is negative infinity to zero union zero to infinity so keep this in mind always remove the horizontal asymptote from the range and remove the vertical asymptote from the domain let's try this one negative one over x minus three so what kind of transformations do you see in this graph there's two of interest x minus three means that the graph the vertical asymptote is going to shift three units to the right if you set the denominator equal to zero you'll see that the vertical asymptote is x is equal to three that's the first transformation which is basically a horizontal shift right three units now we have a negative in front of the function so that means that it's going to you could say reflect over the x-axis if you want to so one over x will typically exist in the upper right and upper left section but it's going to flip this part instead of being at the top is not going to be at the bottom so it's going to exist here and here and that's just a rough sketch it's not an accurate sketch i'm implanting points just a simple rough sketch so now what are the domain and range of this function we know the range is going to be the same the horizontal asymptote is y is equal to zero and y can vary from negative infinity to infinity but it doesn't include zero so the range hasn't changed in this example but the domain has because the vertical asymptote has changed the lowest x value is negative infinity the highest is positive infinity and we need to take out three which is the vertical asymptote so the domain is going to be from negative infinity to three you view it from left to right and then union this side the right side is from three to infinity not including three consider this one one over x plus two how can we graph it what type of transformations exist in this graph so the plus two means that it's going to shift up two units now we know that for one over x the horizontal asymptote is y is equal to zero so if we add two to it it's going to be zero plus two so therefore the horizontal asymptote is y is equal to two it's basically this number here that you see so whatever that constant is out in front that's going to be the horizontal asymptote the vertical asymptote is based on this number or that variable if you set the bottom equal to zero well x will be equal to zero so that's the the va or the vertical asymptote so let's plot the asymptotes so the horizontal asymptote is that y is equal to two and the vertical asymptote is the y-axis which x is equal to 0. now it's positive 1 over x so like 1 over x it's going to exist in the upper right corner and the lower left corner now what's the domain and what's the range for this function so starting with the domain the lowest x value is negative infinity it's going to stop at the vertical asymptote which is x is equal to 0 and the highest x value is infinity so the domain is going to be from negative infinity to 0 union 0 to infinity now what about the range the lowest y value that we see is negative infinity and then it's going to stop at 2 which is the horizontal asymptote and the highest y value is positive infinity so the range is going to be from negative infinity to 2 union 2 to infinity so always remove the horizontal asymptote from the remain i mean excuse me from the range now let's move on to our next example let's try one over x squared minus three so how can we graph this function so we could see that the horizontal asymptote is based on the constant negative three so it's y is equal to negative three and if we set the denominator equal to zero we'll get the vertical asymptote which is simply x is equal to zero so that's everything that we have so far so let's plot the vertical asymptote which is just the y-axis and let's plot the horizontal asymptote which is at y equals negative three so here's the horizontal asymptote and this is positive one over x squared one over x squared is going to be symmetric about the vertical asymptote which is in this case the y axis it's an even function and because it's positive it's going to be above the horizontal asymptotes so it's going to look like this it's the same as 1 over x squared but it's been shifted down 3 units so what's the domain and range of the function so analyzing the domain the graph starts from the left negative infinity it stops at the vertical asymptote and it continues all the way to the right to positive infinity so it's negative infinity to zero union zero to infinity as for the range notice that the lowest y value is negative three and the highest is positive infinity so the range is from negative 3 to infinity and that's it for this example try this problem 3 minus one over x plus two so using everything you know go ahead and draw a rough sketch identify the horizontal and the vertical asymptote and also write the domain and range using interval notation so let's start with the horizontal asymptote so we could see that we have a constant three in front so it's going to be y is equal to positive three and for the vertical asymptote if we set x plus two equal to zero x will be equal to negative two so therefore the graph shifts two units to the left and up three units so this is the vertical asymptote at x equals negative two and then we have the horizontal asymptote at y equals string so here's the question for you will the graphs this graph exist in the upper right corner and the lower left corner or will it exist in the upper left corner and the lower right corner what would you say so is it similar to 1 over x or negative 1 over x notice the negative in front so it's going to reflect over the horizontal asymptote so relative to 1 of x so it's going to exist in the upper left corner and the lower right corner now with this information what is the domain and the range of the function so starting with the domain the lowest x value is negative infinity the vertical asymptote is negative two and the highest is infinity so the domain is going to be from negative infinity to negative two union negative two to infinity as for the range you can see that the lowest y value is negative infinity the horizontal asymptote is positive three and the highest y value is positive infinity so the range is going to be negative infinity to three union three to infinity let's try this one y is equal to 3 divided by 1 over x minus 2 square so what is the horizontal asymptote and what is the vertical asymptote so the horizontal asymptote is based on that number so it's going to be positive 3 again and the vertical asymptote if we set x minus 2 equal to 0 then we can see that x will be equal to positive two and this is similar to the graph one over x squared so it's going to be symmetric about the vertical asymptote so the graph shifts two units to the right and up three units the first thing you should do is always plot the asymptotes so you can draw a good rough sketch now we said that because the squared is going to be symmetric about the vertical asymptotes so it can be like this above the horizontal asymptote or it can look like this now because of the negative sign it's going to reflect over the horizontal asymptote so it's going to be below it so it's going to exist in the lower left and the lower right region so now what are the domain and range of this function how can we figure this out so let's start with the domain all we need to do is take out the hor i mean the vertical asymptote which is 2. so it's going to be negative infinity to 2 union 2 to infinity now what about the range the lowest y value is negative infinity and the highest is the horizontal asymptote in this case which is three so the range is going to be negative infinity to three so now you know how to graph rational functions using transformations 

Transcript for: Graphing Logarithmic Functions
now let's talk about graphing logarithmic functions let's go over the four basic shapes so let's say if you have log x where x and y are both positive kind of like what we did in the last lesson in this case the graph is going to travel towards quadrant one logarithmic functions are basically the inverse of an exponential function exponential functions contain a horizontal asymptote logarithmic functions contain a vertical asymptote exponential functions they increase at an increase in rate logarithmic functions they increase at a decrease in rate so let's say if we were to put 2 to the x and log to the x on the same graph this is the basic curve of 2 to the x and the graph log base 2 dx looks like this i'm going to highlight it in blue these two functions are inverse functions an inverse function reflects across the line y equals zero with its counterpart so let's say this is f this is the inverse of f they reflect about the line y equals x now what is the graph of log of negative x this graph is going to reflect across the y axis so it's going to go towards quadrant two in quadrant two x is negative and y is positive now the next shape we need to be familiar with is this one let's say if we have negative log positive x if the negative is in front instead of reflecting over the y axis it's going to reflect over the x-axis so it's going to travel towards quadrature in quadrant 3 x is positive but y is negative and the last one where y and x are both negative this is going to occur in quadrant three so this reflects relative to the origin it reflects across the origin relative to the original function so those are the four basic logarithmic functions they need to know using transformations of course so now let's work on some examples let's graph log base two of x so the first thing you want to do is you want to set x equal to three things you want to set it equal to zero this is going to be the vertical asymptote next you want to set it equal to one and also whatever the base is the base is this number so you want to set it equal to two next make a table with the two points one and two log of one is always zero now log base two of two if these two numbers are the same it's going to be equal to one so now we can graph it so the vertical asymptote is x equals zero which is basically the y-axis and now we have the points 1 0 which is the x intercept and 2 1. so we're going to start from the y axis and follow those two points and that's how you graph now for exponential functions the domain was all real numbers for logarithmic functions the range is all real numbers notice that the lowest y value is negative infinity and the highest is infinity this function will continue to increase forever so the range is from negative infinity to infinity the range of exponential functions was restricted the range for i mean the domain for logarithmic functions is also restricted the lowest x value is zero and the highest is infinity so the domain is going to be from zero to infinity another way you can find the domain is take the inside and set it greater than zero x is greater than zero from zero to infinity not including zero because zero is their vertical asymptote here's another one that you could try log base three of x minus one plus two feel free to pause the video and go ahead and graph it so let's take the inside part x minus one and let's set it equal to three things zero 1 and whatever the base is equal to in this case the base is 3 and find the value of x for the first one this is going to give us the vertical asymptote so x equal 1 that's the vertical asymptote the next one will have two and then three plus one is four so the two points that we're going to plug in contain the x values two and four and x equals one just keep that in mind this is the vertical asymptote now let's find the y values what is y when x is two so log base three two minus one plus two two minus one is basically one log of one is always zero so this is zero plus two which is two now what is the y value when x is four so this is going to be four minus one four minus one is three log base 3 of 3 because the numbers are the same it's going to be 1 and 1 plus 2 is 3. so now we have everything that we need in order to graph it so let's go ahead and do that now so first let's plot the vertical asymptote which is at x equals one so next we have the point two comma two which is not there but here and then we have the point 4 comma 3 which is there so the graph starts from the vertical asymptote and then it increases towards those points and so that's how you can plot it now go ahead and identify the domain and the range for this graph the lowest y value is negative infinity and the highest is infinity so the range is always going to be all real numbers negative infinity to infinity now let's talk about the domain the lowest x value in this case is the vertical asymptote it's one the highest is positive infinity so it's going to be from one to infinity and so that's the domain for this function now let's try one more example three minus log base four five minus x so let's set five minus x equal to three things zero one and whatever the base is in this case the base is four so x is equal to five that's the vertical asymptote five minus four is one so x is four and five minus one is four so x is one the two x values that we're gonna need are one and four and the vertical asymptote is x equals five now let's fill in the table so let's replace x with one five minus one is four log base four of four because the numbers are the same is equal to one so this is going to be three minus one which is two now let's find the next point five minus four is one and log of one regardless of what the base is is always equal to zero three minus zero is three so all we need is two points and the asymptote once we have that we can go ahead and graph it so let's begin by plotting the vertical asymptote which is at x equals five now we have the point one comma two and also four comma three so the graph is going to start from the vertical asymptote and then it's going to follow these two points let's see if i can uh draw a better graph and i miss it again one more time so it's going to look something like that so notice that the graph is going towards quadrantry eventually it's going to get towards quadrant 3 but it's going to take a while before it gets there you can look at the signs in front of x and y to determine that so notice that the sign in front of x is negative which means that the graph is going to go towards the left and the sign in front of the log is negative which is associated with y if y is negative that means that it's going to go down so relative to this point it's traveling towards quadrant three so just by looking at the signs you can determine what direction it's going to go if you don't want to do that the points will tell you where to go always start from the vertical asymptote and follow the two points and you're gonna get it right as long as you start from the asymptote you can't graph it like this it's just this is not going to work the only way to graph it is to start from the asphalt and follow the two points 

Transcript for: How To Graph Exponential Functions
in this lesson we're going to focus on graphing exponential functions so what we need to do is pick two points let's use zero and one anything raised to the zero power is always one and two to the first power is itself two you can think of this as two to the x plus zero this number here is the horizontal asymptote so if you don't see a number there the horizontal asymptote is the x-axis so y is equal to zero that's the horizontal asymptote so now let's go ahead and graph it so the first point is 0 1 that is the y-intercept and the next point is 1 comma 2. so we're going to start from the horizontal asymptote which is the x-axis and then it's going to increase exponential functions they increase at an increase in rate and that's how you can graph it now what is the domain of the function and what is the range so the domain has to do with the x values the lowest x value is negative infinity and the highest is infinity so for all exponential functions the domain will be all real numbers now the range is limited the range has to deal with the horizontal asymptote the lowest y value is zero the highest y value is infinity so the range is from zero to infinity but it does not include zero the graph never touches the horizontal asymptote it gets very close to it but never touches it there's no value that you can plug in for x that will give you a y value of zero it just doesn't happen here's the next example graph this one 1 over 3 raised to the x so if you had a fraction like this what should we do the best thing to do is to rewrite it if we move the three to the top positive x will change to negative x and so that's it now let's set negative x equal to two things zero and one if you solve and find the value of x x will be zero and negative one those are the values that you want to plug in so if we plug in zero three to the negative zero is simply one and if we plug in negative 1 into this equation 3 raised to the negative negative 1 that's going to be 3 to the 1 which is equal to 3. now the horizontal asymptote is this number so it's still y equals zero which means it's the x axis so if we plot it we have the point zero one which is the y intercept and negative one three so the graph is going to start from the x-axis and then it's going to follow those two points let's do that again so that's the graph the domain is going to be all real numbers unlike the other one the range the y values vary from 0 to infinity so that's going to be the range let's try this example three raised to the x minus two plus one so what we're going to do is set x minus two equal to two things zero and one and let's solve the value of x when x minus two is zero is going to be two if we add two to both sides one plus two is three so those are the two x values that we're gonna use so what is the value of y when x is two so three raised to the two minus two plus one two minus two is zero and three to the zero is one one plus one is two now let's plug in three three minus two is one three to the first power is three three plus one is four so those are the points of interest the horizontal asymptote is based on this number so its y is equal to one now let's go ahead and graph it so we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals one and we have the points two comma two and three comma four so here's two comma two and this is the point three four so it's going to start from the horizontal asymptote and then it's gonna increase towards those points and so that's how you can graph it as always the domain is all real numbers and as for the range it starts from the horizontal asymptote of one and it goes to infinity the lowest y value is when the highest is infinity so the range is from one to infinity and so that's it for this one let's try one more example five minus two raised to the three minus x so to find the two points that we need let's set three minus x equal to zero therefore that means x is equal to three and if we set it equal to one three minus two is one so x is two now let's make a table and let's use the points two and three so what is y when x is two three minus two is one and two to the first power is two so five minus two is equal to three now what is y when x is three three minus three is zero two to the zero is one five minus one is four now what is the horizontal asymptote the horizontal asymptote is the constant in the equation in this case it's y is equal to 5. now we can graph it so let's start with the horizontal asymptote f5 so we have the point two comma three and also three comma four so the graph is going to start from the horizontal asymptote and then it's gonna follow the two points so it's decreasing in this case due to the negative sign in front and that's how you can graph it the domain is all real numbers negative infinity to infinity now what is the range notice that the lowest y value is negative infinity the highest is positive five so the range is from negative infinity to five now let's review four generic shapes of exponential functions the first one we've considered 2 raised to the x so this function increases towards quadrant one the next one is two raised to the negative x and this graph reflects over the y axis so it increases towards quadrant two next we have negative two raised to the positive x this graph reflects over the x-axis and so it travels towards quadrant form and then finally negative two raised to the negative x this graph reflects across the origin relative to the first one and so it travels towards quadrant three so here's what i like to do to keep this in mind this is the way i remember it we have positive x and positive y positive x travels towards the right positive y travels upward so therefore this graph is going to go towards quadrant one now the next one which goes towards quadrant two notice that x is negative and y is positive x is negative towards the left y is positive going up so you're heading towards quadrant two in the third example we're going towards quadrant four x is positive y is negative x is positive towards the right y is negative as you go down so we're going towards quadrant four and the last one which is towards quadrant three both x and y are negative x is negative towards left y is negative as you go down so we're heading towards quadrant dream 

Transcript for: Function Operations
let's say that f of x is equal to two x plus five and g of x let's say g of x is x squared minus four perform the indicated operations so what is f plus g what's the sum of the two functions all you gotta do is add them 2x plus five plus x squared minus four and combine like terms so all we can combine is five and negative four which adds up to one so it's x squared plus two x plus one and so that's the sum of f and g now what about f minus g f is two x plus five and then it's gonna be minus x squared minus four so this is going to be negative x squared plus two x and then we have five minus negative four five minus negative four is like five plus four which is nine so that's equal to f minus g now what about f times g this is just going to be two x plus 5 times x squared minus 4. and we can go ahead and foil it 2x times x squared that's 2x cubed and then 2x times negative 4 that's negative 8x and then we have 5 times x squared that's 5x squared and then 5 times negative 4 it's negative 20. so in standard form it's 2x cubed plus 5x squared minus 8x minus 20. now what is the domain of the three functions that we found let's start with f plus g what is the domain for that whenever you have a polynomial be it a binomial trinomial or many terms where you don't have any fractions no radicals or logarithmic functions the domain will be all real numbers there's no restrictions on the value of x in this expression x can be anything so for these three functions f plus g f minus g and f times g we don't have any fractions or radicals so the domain is all real numbers it's negative infinity to infinity now what about f divided by g what's the domain for this f divided by g is simply two x plus five divided by x squared minus 4. now that we have a fraction the domain is restricted is not all real numbers to find the domain you want to find the x values that do not exist the values that x cannot be to do that set the denominator equal to zero x squared minus four cannot be zero if it is we're going to get a vertical asymptote which means it's undefined at that point now we can factor x squared minus four it's x plus two times x minus two so therefore x cannot equal negative two and it can't equal two these are the vertical asymptotes but they're also infinite discontinuities there's no we can't plug in negative two for x the function will be undefined anytime you have a zero on the bottom it's undefined so how can we write the domain using interval notation if x cannot equal negative two or two it's going to be from negative infinity to negative two union negative two to two union two to infinity so here's another example let's say if we have the function one over x minus three x minus three the denominator cannot be zero so x cannot be three therefore the domain is everything except three that's how you write it let's say if we have this x cannot equal 4 and it can't equal negative 3. just change the sign if you set x minus four to zero x you'll get four facts now to write the domain it's gonna be negative infinity to negative three negative three comes before four union negative three is a four union 4 to infinity so that's the domain for this function so let's say that f of x is equal to 4x plus 5. and g of x let's say it's equal to 8 minus x squared what is f of 2 plus g of three to find f of two we need to replace x with two in the equation four x plus five so that's four times two plus five and that is a terrible looking two to find g of 3 we need to plug it into that equation so it's plus 8 minus 3 squared and then let's add 4 times 2 is 8 and 3 squared is nine eight plus five is thirteen eight minus nine is negative one thirteen minus one is twelve so that's the value of f of two plus g of three you just find the two values and you add them let's try another example so what is f of negative 2 multiplied by g of two so let's do it separately let's find f of negative two first using this formula so it's gonna be four times negative two plus five which is negative eight plus five and so that's negative three now let's calculate g of two using this equation so that's eight minus two squared two squared is four eight minus four is four so now that we have these two values let's replace f of negative two which is negative three and let's replace g of two with four so negative three times four is negative twelve so that's the value of f of negative two times g of negative two i mean times g of positive two so all you gotta do is simply find the values and then multiply them 

Transcript for: Composite Functions
now in this lesson we're going to talk about composite functions so let's say that f of x is equal to 3x minus 4 and that g of x let's say it's equal to x squared minus three what is f of g notice that this is different from f times g if you see a closed circle it's multiplication it's 3x minus 4 times x squared minus 3. but if you see like an open circle what it means is it's a composite function one function is inside of another g is inside of f so this is equivalent to f of g of x so how can we find f of g of x well let's replace g g is x squared minus three and notice that x squared minus three is inside of f so we're going to have to replace x with x squared minus 3. so this is going to be 3 times x squared minus 3 minus 4. so now let's distribute the 3. so that's 3x squared minus 9. minus four which is three x squared minus thirteen now what about g of f how can we find the value of g of f so this time f is inside of g so you can write it like this that's an equivalent expression let's replace f of x with three x minus four and now let's replace uh x with three x minus four so we're going to take this and plug it into here so instead of x squared minus 3 it's 3x minus 4 squared minus 3. 3x minus 4 squared is 3x minus 4 times 2x minus 4. so if we foil it 3x times 3x that's going to be 9x squared and then 3x times negative 4 that's negative 12x negative 4 times 3x is also negative 12x and then negative 4 times negative 4 is 16. negative 12 minus 12 is negative 24 16 minus 3 is 13. so this is the value of g of f of x now let's say that f of x let's say it's 5x plus 2. and now let's say that g of x is equal to x cubed minus four evaluate this function f of g of two how can we do so so first let's find the value of g of two so let's replace x with two this is going to be two raised to the third power minus four two times two times two three times is eight eight minus four is four so g of two is four so f of g of two is equivalent to f of four and now we can take four and plug it into that equation so it's five times four plus two five times four is twenty twenty plus two is twenty two so that's how you can find the value of f of g of two so try this one evaluate g of f let's say negative one so first evaluate f of negative one that's five times negative one plus two so make sure you're using this equation that's negative five plus two which is negative three so f of negative one we can replace it with negative three so now we're looking for g of negative three which we can plug it into here so it's negative three to the third power minus four which is negative 27 minus four and so the final answer is negative thirty one so that's how you can evaluate composite functions you 

Transcript for: Introduction to Inverse Functions
consider the function f of x let's say that it's equal to three x plus nine what is the inverse function given f of x how can we find it in order to find the inverse function the first thing we want to do is replace f of x with y so y is equal to three x plus nine next switch x and y so you need to understand what the inverse function is let's say if you have the point two comma seven the inverse point is 7 2. all you need to do is switch x and y so those points are inverses of each other so once you switch x with y or y with x go ahead and solve get y by itself so we need to subtract both sides by nine first and then to isolate y we need to divide by three so the function x minus 9 over 3 that's the inverse function that's how you can find it so now let's try another example let's say f of x is equal to x squared minus 4. go ahead and determine the inverse function feel free to pause the video so first let's replace f of x with y next let's switch x and y and then solve for the variable y so let's add 4 and then let's take the square root of both sides so the inverse function is simply the square root of x plus four that's the answer let's not forget to add plus or minus since we took the square root of both sides here's another one that you could try let's say that f of x is equal to the cube root of three x plus eight go ahead and determine the inverse function so let's replace y with f of x next let's switch x and y and then let's solve for the variable y so to solve it we need to raise both sides to the third power so x cubed is equal to three y plus eight the cube root and the cube will cancel so now we need to subtract both sides by 8 and then we need to divide both sides by 3. so now we have the inverse function so the inverse function is simply x cubed minus eight over three and so that's it consider the functions f of x which is equal to three x plus nine and g of x which is equal to x minus nine over three how can we determine if these two functions are inverses of each other here's what we need to do f of g of x we need to show that is equal to x and if we can also prove that g of f of x is equal to x then the two functions are inverses of each other so let's go ahead and do that so let's replace g of x with what it's equal to that's x minus nine divided by three and now let's take that and plug it into f so let's replace the x portion with what we see here that is x minus nine over three three divided by three cancels three divided by three is one so we have x minus nine plus nine negative nine plus nine is zero so we simply get x which is what we want now let's focus on the other one let's plug in f of x first let's replace f of x with three x plus nine and now let's plug this into g so let's replace x with three x plus nine so it's three x plus nine minus nine over three nine minus nine is zero so that leaves behind three x divided by three which is x so because both composite functions equal x f of x and g of x are inverses of each other consider the graph f of x is equal to x squared let's find the inverse of this function and let's graph it at the same time so y is equal to x squared to find the inverse we need to switch x and y and we need to find the value of y we need to isolate it so y is equal to plus or minus the square root of x which is the inverse function so the original function is f of x is equal to x squared and the inverse function is plus or minus root x this is the right side of the graph y is equal to x squared and the graph y is equal to the square root of x it looks like this let me draw that better notice that these two they're symmetric about the line y is equal to x that's a property of inverse functions the other side of y equals x squared is over here this is positive root x and then the other side of it negative root x is over here this portion is equidistant from the line y equals x they're still symmetric about it and so that's a property of inverse functions they're symmetric about that line so let's say if we have a function that looks like that and we want to draw the inverse function all we need to do is simply draw the reflection about that line so if the red line is f of x the blue line is the inverse function consider this function let me use a different color so let's say that's f of x the inverse of this function can you determine if the inverse is a function we know how to tell if f of x is a function if f x passes the vertical line test it's a function it touches it only once so f of x is a function now what about the inverse what can we do from this graph to determine if the inverse is a function there's something called the horizontal line test the graph touches the horizontal line test once which means that it's a one-to-one function for every x-value there's only one y-value and for every y-value there's only one x-value so if f of x passes the horizontal line test which means it's one to one that means that the inverse will pass the vertical line test which means the inverse is a function so let's say this is f of x is f of x a function does it pass the vertical line test and yes it does it only touches it once so f of x is a function now what about the inverse the inverse of f of x is that a function well let's see if f of x passes the horizontal line test it does not it touches the horizontal line more than once so because f of x is not a one-to-one function because it does not pass the horizontal line test the inverse is not a function the inverse will not pass the vertical line test so now let's prove it using a graph so let's draw the right side of y equals x squared and just the top part of y equals the square root of x that's y equals positive square root of x these two are inverses of each other but notice that this curve passes the horizontal line test it touched it once so the right side of y equals x squared is a one-to-one function and so the inverse which is y is equal to the square root of x notice that the inverse function it passes the vertical line test so because the original function passes the horizontal line test the inverse will pass the vertical line test which means that the inverse function is a function now let's draw the entire function y equals x squared not just the right side the inverse function of that entire graph is the blue line so notice that the function in red does not pass the horizontal line test it touches it at two points which means that it's no longer one to one and therefore the inverse function will no longer pass the vertical line test which means that the inverse function is not a function so you can use the horizontal line test to determine if the inverse function will pass the vertical line test if it passes it that means the inverse function is a function so if f x does not pass the horizontal line test the inverse function will not pass the vertical line test and so the inverse is not a function you 

Transcript for: Horizontal Line Test and One to One Functions
consider this function let's use a linear function as our example and let's call it f of x so does f of x have an inverse function determine if f of x have an inverse function you have to show that it's a one-to-one function you have to show that it passes the horizontal line test so if we draw a horizontal line that's a terrible horizontal line if f x touches the horizontal line more than once that means f of x is not a one to one function it does not have an inverse function but in this example it only intersects the horizontal line only at one point so f of x is a one-to-one function which means that it has an inverse function so let's look at some other examples so what about this parabolic function does it have an inverse function well if we draw a horizontal line notice that it touches the horizontal line at two points so therefore let's call this function g of x g of x does not have an inverse function if you try to draw the inverse relation it's not going to be a function it's going to look something like this this is just like a rough sketch and notice that it does not pass the vertical line test so therefore the inverse relation is not a function so we can say that g of x does not have an inverse function because it's not a one to one function let's look at some more examples so go ahead and determine if the following functions have inverse functions let's call this f of x let's call this one g of x so f of x does not pass the horizontal line test it is not a one-to-one function and so it doesn't have an inverse function g of x passes the horizontal line test it touches it only at one point so g of x has an inverse function and it is a one-to-one function so what about this one this function does not pass the horizontal line test it touches it at three points and so it's not a one to one function and it does not have an inverse function so that's it for this video now you know how to determine if a function contains an inverse function and if it's a one-to-one function so keep in mind if you have some function f of x if it's a one-to-one function that means that it passes the horizontal line test and it does have an inverse function let's say we have g of x if it doesn't have if it doesn't pass the horizontal line test it is not a one-to-one function and it doesn't have an inverse function you 

Transcript for: Properties of Logarithms
in this video we're briefly going to go over some properties of logs that you need to be familiar with the first one is the power rule let's say we have log a raised to the n you can move the exponent in front so this is equal to n log a the second is the product rule log a times log b is equal to log a plus log b and then you have the quotient rule log a divided by log b is log a minus log b so we can use this in order to evaluate logs so for instance let's say if we want to simplify log base 5 of 5 raised to the 7. so what we can do is move the seven to the front so this is equal to seven log base five of five a log base five of five because they're the same it's equal to one and 7 times 1 is 7. let's try another example like that log base 2 of 8 raised to the fifth power so let's move the 5 to the front so this is equal to 5 times log base 2 of 8. now how many twos do we need to multiply to get to 8 we need to multiply 3 2s 2 to the third is 8 so log base two of a is three and five times three is fifteen now let's work on this example log base two of sixteen times eight so we can use the product rule to separate the 16 and the 8. if you recall log of a times b is equal to log a plus log of b so therefore log base 2 of 16 times 8 is going to be log base 2 of 16 plus log base 2 of 8. now log base 2 of 16 that's 4 because 2 to the fourth power is sixteen log base two of eight is three so the final answer is four plus three which is seven try this one log base three 27 times 81 so first let's separate it into two logs this is log base 3 of 27 plus log base 3 of 81 3 to the third power is 27 so log base 3 of 27 is 3 log base 3 of 81 is 4 because 3 to the fourth power is 81 and this adds to 7. now what about division what is log base 4 of 256 minus 64. so using the quotient rule log a divided by b is equal to log a minus log b so therefore this is going to be log base 4 of 256 minus log base 4 of 64. 4 to the fourth power is 256 and four to the third power is 64. and four minus three is one and so that's going to be the answer try this one log base two of 128 over 8. so this is equal to log base 2 of 128 minus log base 2 of 8. now 2 to the 7th power is 128 and 2 to the third is 8 so 7 minus 3 is 4 and that's going to be the answer here's the last example log base 2 of 128 times 64 divided by 8 times 16 raised to the fifth power so the first thing we should do is move the five and it's going to be distributed to everything now every number that's on top will have a positive sign the numbers on the bottom will have a negative sign so it's going to be log base 2 of 128 plus log base 2 of 64 since they're multiplied to each other minus log base 2 of 8 since it's divided by and also minus log base 2 of 16. log base two of one twenty eight we know it's seven two to the sixth power is sixty four two to the third is eight two to the fourth is sixteen negative 3 and negative 4 adds up to negative 7 which cancels with the positive 7. so the final answer is 5 times 6 which is 30. you 

Transcript for: Natural Logarithms
in this lesson we're going to focus on simplifying natural logs with e so let's start with the basics what is the natural log of one log of one is always zero a log can have any base it could be base 4 it can be base 10 it could be anything however when it has the base e a log becomes a natural log so natural logs only have base e and e is a number it's like 2.718 something but that's e so now what is the natural log of e because the base is the same as e ln base e of e is one so the natural log of e is always equal to one make sure you know that by the way now what is the natural log of e raised to the seventh we could take the seven and move it to the front so this is seven lne and we know that lne is one so this is equal to seven now what about e raised to the ln 8 what is that equal to do you recall what 5 log base 5 of 9 is equal to since these are the same the answer is simply not the natural log has the base e and so these are the same and the answer is simply 8. now what about e raised to the natural log of x cubed so once again the base is e and so these will cancel and this is simply equal to x cubed let's try one more example e raised to the seven l and y what is that equal to we can't just say it's y because of the seven however what we can do is take the seven and move it here so this is equivalent to e ln y to the seventh and the base is e so we can get rid of these two and the final answer is simply y to the seventh you 

Transcript for: Solving Exponential Equations
consider the following exponential equation three raised to the x plus two is equal to nine raised to the two x minus three how can we find the value of x without using logs what you need to do is change base nine into base three three squared is equal to nine so we can replace nine with three squared and whenever you raise one exponent to another exponent you need to multiply so we got to multiply two by two x minus three so on the right side this is going to be three raised to the four x minus six now if the bases are the same then the exponents must be equal to each other therefore x plus 2 is equal to four x minus six now let's subtract both sides by x and let's add six to both sides so these two will cancel two plus six is eight four x minus x is three x so we can see that x is equal to eight over three and so that's the answer for this one now let's work on another example 8 raised to the 4x minus 12 is equal to 16 raised to the 5x minus 3. so go ahead and find the value of x now what we need to do is convert 8 and 16 into a common base 2 is a multiple of 8 and 16 so 2 is the common base 2 to the third power is 8 2 to the fourth power 16. so let's replace 8 with 2 to the third power and let's replace 16 with 2 to the fourth power now we need to multiply 4x minus 12 by 3. 4x times 3 is 12x 3 times negative 12 is negative 36. now we need to multiply 5x minus 3 by 4. so that's going to give us 20x minus 12. so we could set these two equal to each other now that we have the same base so 12x minus 36 is equal to 20x minus 12. let's subtract both sides by 12x let's add 12 to both sides so negative 24 is equal to 8x therefore x is equal to negative three let's try one more example 27 raised to the 3x minus 2. let's say that's equal to 81 raised to the two x plus seven so try this problem now three to the third power is equal to twenty seven and three to the fourth power is equal to eighty one so let's replace twenty seven with three cubed and let's replace eighty-one with three to the fourth power three times three x minus two that's going to be nine x minus six and four times two x plus seven that's eight x plus twenty eight so now that we have the same base we can set the exponents equal to each other so nine x minus six is equal to eight x plus twenty eight so let's subtract both sides by eight x and let's add six to both sides so these will cancel nine x minus eight x is x twenty eight plus six is thirty four so x is equal to thirty four in this example three raised to the x is equal to eight what is the value of x in order to find it we can take the log or the natural log of both sides it really doesn't matter which one you're going to use let's take the log of both sides once you do that you can move the exponent to the front so x log 3 is equal to log 8. so x is log eight divided by log three if you type this in you should get 1.8928 and you can check your answer what is 3 raised to the 1.8928 if you type that in the calculator will give you this answer eight point zero zero zero zero nine granted this is rounded so this is going to be very close to eight what about this one if e raised to the x is equal to 7 what is the value of x now whenever you're dealing with base e it's better to use the natural log as opposed to the regular log so we're going to take the natural log of both sides and we're going to move x to the front so x ln e is equal to ln7 and e is one so x times one is x so the answer is l and seven this is the exact answer and then you could type it in if you want the decimal answer so the decimal answer is 1.9459 so that's the approximation now let's work on this example 5 plus 4 raised to the x minus 2 is equal to 23 let's find the value of x so let's begin by subtracting both sides by 5. we can't take the log of both sides yet it wouldn't be wise 23 minus 5 is 18. now at this point we can't really convert 18 into a base two two to the fourth is 16 2 to the fifth is 32 so we can't really change 18 to a base two so we have to take the log of both sides you can also use the natural log too it will work as well now we can move the exponent to the front and so it's x minus 2 in parentheses times log 4 and that's equal to log 18. i wouldn't recommend distributing log 4 to x minus two instead it's better to divide both sides by log four so x minus two is equal to log 18. well let's get the exact answer first so this is equal to log 18 over log 4. the exact answer is this x is equal to 2 plus log 18 over log 4. log 18 divided by log 4 that's about 2.08496 and if we add 2 to it we can see that x is equal to 4.08496 so that's the answer let's try this problem 3 plus 2 e raised to the 3 minus x let's say it's equal to 7. go ahead and find the value of x so before we take the natural log of both sides let's subtract both sides by three so two e to the three minus x is equal to four next let's divide both sides by two so e to the three minus x is equal to two and now we can take the natural log of both sides now let's move the exponent to the front so three minus x times ln e is equal to ln2 and lne is one so this is just gonna be three minus x now what i'm gonna do is take the negative x move it to this side it's negative x on the left side but it's gonna be positive x on the right side now i'm going to take ln 2 move it to this side which is going to change from positive to negative so x is 3 minus ln 2. that's the exact answer the decimal value is 2.3069 how would you solve this equation three raised to the x squared plus four let's say that's equal to one over twenty seven what would you do in order to find the value of x in this case we know that three to the third is equal to twenty seven so three to the negative three is one over twenty seven we need to make the bases the same so this is 3 to the negative 3. because the bases are the same we can now make the exponents equal to each other which means that x squared plus 4x is equal to negative 3. now let's move the negative three to the left side in which case is going to be positive three and we could factor two numbers that multiply to three but add to four are three and one so this is x plus three and x plus one so therefore x can be equal to negative three and x is equal to negative one here's another example two raised to the x squared times two raised to the three x is equal to sixteen find the value of x two to the fourth is equal to sixteen so let's replace sixteen with that now let's say if you're multiplying by a common base you can add the exponents 2 plus 3 is 5. in this case 2 is the common base so we can add x squared and three x so this is two x squared plus three x so now we can set x squared plus three x equal to four now let's subtract both sides by four so x squared plus three x minus four is equal to zero and let's factor two numbers that multiply to negative four but add to positive three are positive four and negative one so it's x plus four times x minus one which means that x is equal to negative four and it's equal to positive one try this 4 raised to the 2x minus 20 multiplied by 4 raised to the x plus 64 is equal to 0. so what can we do in order to find the value of x what i think we should do is factor but factor by substitution this equation can be reduced to a quadratic equation we're going to set a equal to 4 raised to the x which means that a squared is 4 to the 2x so let's replace 4 to the 2x with a squared and let's replace 4 to the x with a what two numbers multiply to 64 but add to negative 20. this is negative 16 and negative 4. so to factor it it's a minus 16 and a minus 4. so therefore a is equal to 16 and a is equal to 4. and we know that a is 4 to the x so therefore 4 raised to the x is equal to 16 and 4 to the x is equal to 4. 4 is basically 4 to the first power so we can clearly see that x is equal to 1. now 16 is equivalent to 4 squared so 4 to the x is equal to 4 squared which means that x is equal to 2 and so those are the two answers let's try one more example three to the two x minus three to the two x minus one let's say it's equal to eighteen go ahead and find the value of x so we can't really factor in this example because 2x is not twice the value of 2x minus 1. but we could factor the gcf we could take out a 3 to the 2x 3 to the two x divided by itself is equal to one now three to the two x minus one divided by three to the two x if we uh write it out notice what we'll get let's ignore the negative sign for now we know the overall answer is going to be negative when you divide by a common base you need to subtract the exponents 2x minus 1 minus 2x the 2x will cancel and so it's going to be 3 to the negative 1. and so that's what we have right now and if you distribute you can see that you're going to get the original equation 3 to the 2x times 1 gives you this term and 3 to the 2x times 3 to negative 1 you add the exponents 2x plus negative 1 is 2x minus 1. now let's divide both sides by this three to the negative one is basically one third so we have a complex fraction let's multiply the top and the bottom by three so eighteen times three is fifty four three times one is three three times a third is one and three minus 1 is 2 54 over 2 is 27 so 3 to the 2x is equal to 27 and 27 is 3 to the third power so 2x is equal to 3 which means that x is 3 over 2 and so that's the answer you 

Transcript for: Solving Logarithmic Equations
in this lesson we're going to focus on solving basic logarithmic equations let's start with this one log base 2 of 16 is equal to x go ahead and find the value of x what we need to do is convert it to exponential form 2 raised to the x is equal to 16. now you might already see the answer but i'm going to go ahead and solve it now we know that 2 to the 4th power is 16. so therefore x is equal to four you can also do this log of 16 divided by log of two if you type that in that's equal to four which is x using the change of base formula try this one log of x log base x of 81 is equal to four what is x so let's convert it to its exponential form x to the fourth is 81. so now let's find the value of x to do that we need to take the fourth root of both sides so the fourth root of 81 is equal to 3 because three to the fourth is eighty-one now what about this one log base five of x is equal to three convert it to its exponential form five to the third is equal to x that's five times five times five five times five is twenty-five and five quarters is a dollar twenty-five so twenty-five times 5 is 125. let's try some more examples log base 32 of x let's say it's equal to 4 over 5. go ahead and try this one so 32 raised to the 4 over 5 is equal to x and what is that equal to what is 32 raised to the 4 over 5 how can we simplify this exponential fraction so first you want to find the fifth root of 32 and then raise it to the fourth power so what number multiplied it by itself five times is 32 2 to the fifth power is 32 so therefore 32 to the one fifth is two so now we got to find out what two to the fourth is equal to two to the fourth is sixteen and so x is sixteen here's the next one log base three of five x plus one is equal to four find the value of x so let's convert it to its exponential form three to the fourth is equal to what's inside and three to the fourth is eighty-one let's subtract both sides by one eighty-one minus one is eighty and if we divide by five 80 divided by 5 is 16. so that's the value of x if log x is equal to 24 what is the value of x now we don't have a base if there are no bases written it's assumed to be base 10. so this is going to be 10 raised to the 24th which is a very very big number so i'm going to leave it as 10 to the 24th now what about this one ln x is equal to 7 what is the value of x natural logs have the base e so e to the 7th is equal to x and that is the answer now if you want the decimal value x is approximately 1096.65 try this one log base 7 x squared plus 3x plus 9 is equal to 2. so let's convert it to its exponential form 7 raised to the second power is equal to what's inside that is it's equal to x squared plus three x plus nine seven squared is forty nine and let's subtract both sides by nine so forty is equal to x squared plus three x let's move the 40 to the right side so x squared plus 3x minus 40 is equal to zero now what two numbers multiply to negative 40 but add to three this is going to be 8 and negative 5. so this can be factored to x plus 8 times x minus 5. so x is equal to negative 8 and positive 5. let's try this example the natural log of three x minus two let's say it's equal to five what is the value of x so keep in mind the base is e so e raised to the fifth power is equal to the stuff inside that is it's equal to three x minus two so now let's get x by itself so let's add two to both sides so e to the fifth plus two is equal to three x and if we divide by three x is equal to e to the fifth plus two over three and as a decimal this is approximately 50.14 let's try one more example four times the natural log of two x minus one plus three is equal to eleven go ahead and find the value of x so let's begin by subtracting both sides by three so eleven minus three is eight now let's divide both sides by four eight divided by four is two at this point we can convert it into its exponential form so e raised to the second power is equal to 2x minus 1. so let's add one to both sides and then let's divide by two so x is equal to e squared plus one over two and as a decimal that is approximately 4.1945 consider this equation log base 3 5 x plus 2 and let's say that's equal to log base 3 7 x minus eight what is the value of x now because the bases are the same that means that the stuff inside of the log must be equal to each other so therefore five x plus two is equal to seven x minus eight so now we can find the value of x let's subtract both sides by five x and let's add eight to both sides two plus eight is ten seven x minus five x is two x so therefore x is ten divided by two which is equal to five and that's all you need to do for this example so now it's your turn try this example let's say that log base 2 of x squared plus 4x is equal to log base 2 of 5. feel free to pause the video so because the bases are the same that means that x squared plus four x must equal five now we have a quadratic equation so let's move the five to the left side it's going to be negative five on the left and now let's factor what two numbers multiply to negative five but add to the middle term four this is positive five and negative one so we have x plus five times x minus one is equal to zero so x is equal to negative five and x is equal to one and so those are the answers now let's work on a different example log base 2 of x plus log base 2 of x plus 4 is equal to 5. go ahead and calculate the value of x now let's review a basic property of logs log a plus log b is equal to log a times b we need to use this equation to combine the two logs into a single log so if log base 2 of x plus log base 2 of x plus 4 is equal to 5 then log base 2 of x times x plus 4. that has to be equal to 5 as well so now let's convert it to its exponential form 2 to the fifth is equal to what's inside and let's distribute the x so x times x is x squared x times four is four x and two to the fifth power is thirty two so now let's move the 32 to the other side it's positive on the left side which means it's negative on the right side so now let's factor what two numbers multiply to negative 32 but add to four so we have eight and negative four so this is going to be x plus eight times x minus four so x is equal to negative eight and positive four in this example we need to check the answers we need to check for extraneous solutions if we replace x with negative eight notice that this is not going to work you cannot have a negative number inside a log and you could type it in your calculator type in log negative eight it's going to give you an error so this answer is it doesn't work now let's plug in 4. so log base 2 of 4 plus log base 2 of 4 plus 4 which is 8 is that equal to 5. well we know 2 squared is 4. so log base 2 of 4 is 2 log base 2 of 8 is 3 because 2 to the third power is 8 and 2 plus 3 isn't 8 5. so that works try this one log base 3 of x plus 1 let's say it's equal to 3 minus log base 3 of x plus 7. so what do you think we need to do here in this example we cannot set x plus one equal to x plus seven because of the three here however we could take this log and move it to this side and it's going to be similar to the last problem if we do that so it's going to be positive log 3 x plus 7. so now we can combine the two logs into a single log by multiplying the stuff on the inside so we need to multiply x plus one times x plus seven so now let's convert it to its exponential form three to the third power is equal to the stuff inside and let's go ahead and foil x plus one times x plus seven x times x is x squared x times seven that's seven x and then we have one times x which is x and one times seven that's seven three to the third power is twenty seven seven x plus x is eight x and now let's subtract both sides by twenty seven so we have 0 on the left and 7 minus 27 is negative 20. so what two numbers multiply to negative 20 but add to the middle number eight this is going to be ten and negative two so we're gonna have x plus ten and x minus two so x is equal to negative ten and positive two so let's see which one works and which one does not work so the original equation is log base three x plus 1 which is equal to everything on the right side so we can see that negative 10 is not going to work if you plug in negative 10 negative 10 plus one is a negative number and we cannot have a negative number inside the log if we plug in two two plus one is three two plus seven is nine that's okay so two is gonna work that's the answer so here's another equation that you'll see as well so this time instead of having a plus sign in between the two logs we're gonna have a minus sign and if you recall log of a minus log of b is equal to log a divided by b so we need to combine the two logs using division so we're going to write it as a single log and the one that's positive is going to go on top that is 2x plus 6. x minus 1 has a negative sign in front of the log and all of this is equal to 1. so now let's convert it to its exponential form four to the first power is equal to what's inside so that's equal to two x plus six divided by x minus one four is the same as four over one so now let's cross multiply 1 times 2x plus 6 is 2x plus 6 and 4 times x minus 1 is 4x minus 4. now let's subtract both sides by 2x and let's add 4 to both sides 6 plus 4 is 10 4x minus 2x is 2x and 10 divided by 2 is 5. so this is the answer and if you plug in 5 into x minus 1 that will give you a positive number if you plug it into here that will also give you a positive number so we won't get any negative numbers inside a log so x is equal to five this is the last example for this video feel free to try so whenever you have an equation with two logs and a number you want to get the two logs by itself on one side of the equation so let's move this to this side so log base 2 x plus 3 minus log base 2 x minus 3 that's equal to 4. so let's combine this two logs into a single log using division the one that's positive will go on top and now let's convert it to its exponential form so 2 to the fourth power is equal to what's inside and two to the fourth is 16 so now let's go ahead and cross multiply so we have x times i mean 1 times x plus 3 which is x plus 3 and then 16 times x minus 3 that's 16x minus 48. now let's subtract both sides by x and let's add 48 to both sides so these will cancel 48 plus 3 that's 51 and let's see 16x minus x is 15x so if we divide by 15 x is 51 over 15. now both numbers are divisible by 3. 51 divided by 3 is 17 15 divided by 3 is 5. so it's 17 over 5. let's say that log x raised to the log x is equal to 49. what is the value of x what would you do first in this problem what we can do is move this in front so we'll have log x times log x is equal to 49 log x times log x is equivalent to log x squared and now what we can do is take the square root of both sides the square root will cancel with the square so on the left it's just going to be log x on the right the square root of 47 i mean not 47 but 49 is plus or minus 7. so log x is equal to positive 7 and log x is equal to negative seven now keep in mind the base is ten so let's convert it into its exponential form ten raised to the seven is equal to x so x is equal to ten to the seventh which is ten million ten to the negative seven is also equal to x and so this is the answer ten to the negative seven is like point zero zero zero zero zero zero one so it's a positive number and if you plug in a positive number into a log there's nothing wrong with that there's no issue with that so both answers are acceptable you can't plug in a negative number inside the log but these are positive numbers one is just very large the other is simply very small here's the next one log of x squared is equal to log x squared what is the value of x in this problem the first thing i would recommend doing is moving the two so this is uh 2 log x you can't move this 2 because the 2 applies to everything this 2 means that you have log x times log x which is completely different so we can't move that 2 to the front so right now this is what we have now i'm going to take 2 log x and move it to the right side so 0 is equal to log x squared minus two log x now let's factor the gcf is log x log x squared divided by log x is log x negative two log x divided by log x is simply negative two now we can set each factor equal to zero so log x is equal to zero and also this part log x minus two is also equal to zero now let's be careful because this is log x minus two is equal to zero the x is part of the log but the 2 is not now the base of log is 10 10 raised to the 0 is equal to x and anything raised to 0 power is 1 so therefore x is equal to 1. now let's get the other answer so first let's add 2 to both sides so log x is equal to 2 and the base is ten so ten squared is equal to x ten squared is equal to a hundred so x is equal to one hundred now let's make sure that we do indeed have the right answers so let's check each one and let's write the original equation which was log x squared is equal to log x squared so let's start with one log one squared is that equal to log one squared log one is zero and zero squared is also zero so that is a true statement so x is indeed equal to one now let's plug in a hundred log one hundred squared is that equal to log 100 squared well we can move the 2 to the front so this is 2 times log 100 and log 100 keep in mind the base is 10 ten squared is a hundred so log one hundred is two so two times two is is equal to two squared they both equal four so x is indeed equal to one and one hundred try this log of log of x is equal to four go ahead and find the value of x if you don't see a base it's base ten so ten raised to the four is equal to what's inside which is log x now ten to the four is ten thousand it's a one with four zeros now keep in mind the base of this log is also 10 and 10 raised to the 10 000 is equal to the stuff inside which is x so that's the answer it's 10 raised to the 10 000. here's another one like that log base 3 of log base 2x let's say that's equal to 2. so 3 raised to the second power is equal to what's inside which is log base 2 of x and 3 squared is 9. and we know that two raised to the nine is equal to the stuff inside which is x so x is two to the ninth power so what exactly is two to the ninth power two to the ninth is two to the fourth times two to the fourth times two to the first power because four plus four plus one is nine two to the fourth is sixteen sixteen times sixteen is two fifty-six two fifty-six times two is 512 and you can also just type this in your calculator you should get 512 as well you 

Transcript for: Logarithms - Practice Problems
number one condense the following expression into a single logarithm so go ahead and try this problem the first thing we need to do is move the coefficients to their exponent positions so this is equivalent to log x to the third power minus log y to the fifth power plus log z raised to the two thirds so now we can write it as a single log expression the logs that have a plus sign will go on the top so x cubed and z to the two-thirds are going to go in the numerator of this fraction this one is associated with a negative log so y to the fifth is going to go on the bottom and so that's how you can write it as a single log and if you want to you can write z to the two thirds as the cube root of z squared number two expand the following logarithmic expression into a sum or difference of logs the first thing that we can do in this problem is we can move the 5 to the front so this is going to be 5 log cube root of a b squared over c to the fourth now i'm going to rewrite this as 5 log i'm going to change the cube root of a b squared that's equivalent to a b squared raised to the one third and i'm going to distribute the one third so it's a to the one third b to the two thirds over c to the fourth so now we can expand into uh multiple logs so it's going to be five log a to the one third plus log b to the two thirds and because c is on the bottom it's going to be negative log c to the fourth power now the last thing that we need to do is move the exponents back and write them as coefficients so it's five times one third log a plus two thirds log b minus four log c so that's the answer and if we want to we could distribute the five but we don't have to we can leave it like this number three what is the domain of the logarithmic function shown below in order to find this you can graph the function and then you can literally see what the domain is going to be another technique that you can use is you can set the inside portion of the log greater than zero you cannot have a zero inside a log log of zero does not exist and log of a negative number does not exist so only positive numbers can exist inside the log function so now let's subtract both sides by five negative x is greater than negative five now if we divide both sides by negative one the inequality will change direction so x is less than five if we plot this on a number line we have an open circle at five and because x is less than 5 we're going to shade to the left so the domain is going to be from negative infinity to 5 but not including 5. therefore b is the right answer to this problem number four what is the range of the exponential function shown below this time we're going to go ahead and graph it so let's take the exponent and we're going to set it equal to two things zero and one so if we solve for x x is going to be three and four so we're gonna make our table based on those values three and four now when x is equal to three what is the value of y three minus three is zero two to the zero is one one plus one is two and when x is equal to four three minus i mean four minus three is one so we get two to the first power plus one that's two plus one that's three and then we have the horizontal asymptote which is y is equal to one now let's draw a rough sketch so let's start with the horizontal asymptote and then we have the point three comma two which is here and four comma three so the graph is going to start from the horizontal asymptote and then it increases now the range has to do with the y values the lowest y value is the horizontal asymptote it's 1 and the highest is infinity but it doesn't include one so it's from one to infinity so a is the answer number five calculate the value of x in the equation shown below now if you recall log a plus log b can be combined into a single log by multiplying a and b and that's what we're gonna have to do in this problem so we're going to have log base 2 and then we can multiply x plus 1 together with 5 x plus 1 and all of that should equal 6. now let's convert this equation into its exponential form two raised to the sixth power is equal to the stuff inside and now let's go ahead and foil x plus one times five x plus one x times x i mean x times five x rather that's 5x squared and then we have x times 1 which is simply x and then 1 times 5x and finally 1 times 1. two to the sixth power that's equal to sixty-four x plus five x is six x and now let's subtract both sides by 64. so 0 is equal to 5x squared plus 6x minus 63. so what two numbers that multiply to the product of five times negative 63 adds up to six five times sixty is three hundred five times three is fifteen so this is negative three fifteen factors of 63 are nine and seven so we could try to divide negative three fifteen by nine if we do that that will give us a negative thirty-five factors of nine are three and three so we have five three three and seven so those are some prime numbers so we could use seven and three which is twenty one three fifteen divided by twenty one is 15 and these two differ by six so let's replace 6x with 21x and negative 15x now we can factor it now let's factor by grouping so let's take out the gcf in the first two terms let's reverse the order it might be easier to put the negative 15x with 5x squared so now let's take out the gcf in the first two terms which is going to be 5x 5x squared divided by 5x is x negative 15x divided by 5x is negative 3. and we could take out a 7 from 21 and 63. so this is going to be actually we could take out a 21. and this is going to be x minus 3. 21 times negative 3 is negative 63. so this is going to be x minus 3 times the stuff on the outside which is uh 5x plus 21. so therefore we can see that x is equal to 3 and if we set 5x plus 21 equal to 0 x is going to be negative 21 over 5. so clearly the right answer is answer choice c number six what interest rate compounded quarterly is required to double an 8 000 investment in 10 years so let's write the equation a is equal to p 1 plus r over n raised to the nt so the initial investment is 8 000 and if we're going to double it we need it to turn into sixteen thousand our goal is to solve for r since it's compounding quarterly n is four and we want it to double in ten years so t is ten let's begin by dividing both sides by eight thousand sixteen thousand divided by eight thousand that is equal to two and four times ten is forty so to get rid of the parentheses on the right we need to raise both sides to the reciprocal of 40 which is 1 over 40. 40 times 1 over 40 is one so these two will cancel so the fourth fruit or rather the 40th fruit of 2 is equal to 1 plus r over 4. if we subtract both sides by 1 we'll get this and now to get r by itself we need to multiply both sides by four so r is going to equal four times the 40th root of two minus one so as a decimal r is point zero six nine nine and if we multiply by a hundred percent this will give us six point nine nine percent so that is the interest rate that is needed in order to double the investment in 10 years so b is the right answer if you round it to the nearest whole number number seven which of the following is equivalent to the logarithmic expression shown below so what we need to do is we need to split the log into two separate logs using this formula log a b is equivalent to log a plus log b so therefore log 16 times 32 is log 16 plus log 32 and log 9 times 27 is log 9 plus log 27 and we'll have to distribute the negative sign so what is log base 2 of 16 two to the what power is sixteen how many twos do you have to multiply to get to sixteen two to the fourth power is sixteen so log base two of sixteen is four you can also type in log sixteen divided by log 2 in your calculator and that will also give you 4. 2 to the fifth power is 32 and 3 squared is 9 so log base 3 of 9 is 2. log base 3 of 27 is 3 because three to the third power is twenty-seven it takes three threes to get to twenty-seven four plus five is nine two plus three is five nine minus five is four so therefore d is the right answer number eight calculate the value of x in the equation shown below so what we need to do is convert one over 16 and 64 into a common base such as two or four i think four is easier now we know that four squared is equal to sixteen which means that four raised to the negative two is one over sixteen and also four cubed is sixty-four so let's replace one over sixteen with four to the negative 2 and let's replace 64 with 4 to the third now whenever you have one exponent raised to another exponent you can multiply the two exponents so let's multiply negative 2 by 2x minus three and so that's going to be negative four x plus six and let's multiply three by five x plus one so it's going to be fifteen x plus three now since the bases are equal to each other the exponents must be equal to each other so therefore negative 4x plus 6 has to equal 15x plus 3. so let's add 4x to both sides and let's subtract 3 from both sides 6 minus 3 is 3 15 plus 4 is 19. so therefore x is equal to three over nineteen and so that's the answer number nine determine the value of x in the logarithmic equation shown below so what we need to do is combine the two logs into a single log log a minus log b is equivalent to log a over log b so let's go ahead and use that equation so this is going to be log base 3 on top it's going to be 10 x plus 1 divided by x plus 1 and that's going to equal 2. now let's convert it into its exponential form 3 to the second power is equal to what's inside now three to the second power is nine and what we need to to do at this point is um we need to cross multiply so nine times the stuff on the bottom that's going to be nine x plus nine and then one times the stuff on the top is ten x plus one so now let's subtract both sides by nine x and also by one so ten x minus nine x is x nine minus one is eight so therefore x is equal to eight which means that d is the right answer number 10 the half-life of element x is 8 days how long will it take for 100 grams of element x to decay such that only 12.5 grams of element x remains so there's two ways we're going to do this conceptually and using an equation so let's start with 100 grams of element x the half-life is eight days the half-life is the time it takes for half the substance to decay which means half is going to remain so after eight days there's going to be 50 grams left over after another 8 days 25 and half of 25 is 12.5 so it takes three half-lives or eight times three which is 24 days for element x to decay to a final amount of 12.5 grams so 24 days is the answer but now let's get the same answer using an equation so let's use this equation a is equal to p e raised to the rt so first we need to find the value of r so let's say the initial amount is a hundred and the half-life is eight days so in eight days the final amount is going to be half of 100 it's going to be 50. so let's calculate r if we divide both sides by 100 50 divided by 100 is 0.5 so 0.5 is equal to e raised to the 8r so now let's take the natural log of both sides this will allow us to take the exponent and move it to the front so ln of 0.5 is equal to 8r lne the natural log of e is one and so r is going to be ln point five divided by eight so r is negative point zero eight six six four three so now that we have that let's go and find out how long it's going to take to decay to a final amount of 12.5 so a the final amount is 12.5 p is a hundred r is negative point zero eight six six four three and our goal is to find the value of t so let's divide both sides by a hundred so 12.5 divided by 100 is 0.215 and so it's equal to this now let's go ahead and take the natural log of both sides and then let's move the exponent to the front so the natural log of 0.125 is equal to negative .086643 t lne and lne is one so t is equal to ln 0.125 over negative point zero eight six six four three so let's go ahead and type that in so this will give you 24.0001 which we could just round it to 24. so that's how you can get the answer using the compound and continuous equation or you can just figure it out conceptually but sometimes you might have a perfect number like 12.5 because 12.5 is half of 25 which is half of 50 which is half of 100 they may give you a number like 9.6 or 11.4 in which case you can estimate it using the the first method but if you want to find the exact answer you use the equation as we've used it in this problem 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 - Introduction to Limits
in this video we're just going to go over a basic introduction into limits and how to evaluate them analytically and graphically so here's a simple example let's say if we want to find the limit as x approaches two of the function x squared minus four divided by x minus two so how can we do so well one way is to use direct substitution if we plug in two notice what will happen two squared is four four minus four is zero so zero over zero is undefined which we don't know what value that represents now sometimes you could find the limit by plugging a value that's close to two and that's what you want to do you want to plug in a number that's close to two but not exactly two so for example let's call this f of x so let's calculate f of 1.9 and let's see what's going to happen actually let's make it 2.1 so let's get a positive answer instead of a negative one two point one squared minus 4 that's about 0.41 and 2.1 minus 2 is 0.1 so this is going to be 4.1 now what if we pick a value that's even closer to 2 for example let's try 2.01 so if you type this in the way you see it in your calculator you may have to put this in parenthesis you should get 4.01 so notice what's happening as we get closer and closer to two the limit approaches four so we could therefore say that the limit as x approaches two of this function is equal to four and this technique works for any limit as long as you plug in a number that's very close to whatever this number is but not exactly that number if the limit exists it's going to converge to a certain value now sometimes you have to use other techniques to get the answer in this particular example we could factor x squared minus four you can write it as x plus two times x minus two now we need to rewrite the limit expression until we replace x with two now notice that we can cancel x minus two so when this term is gone we can now use direct substitution because the x minus two factor was giving us a zero in the denominator which we don't want so now all we need to do is find the limit as x approaches two of x plus two so now we can replace x with two and two plus two is four and so that's the limit it approaches a value of 4. now let's look at another example what is the limit as x approaches 5 of x squared plus two x minus four so notice that we don't have a fraction we're not going to get a zero in the denominator so for a question like this you can use direct substitution so all you got to do is plug in five so it's going to be five squared plus two times five minus four so that's 25 plus 10 minus four and 25 plus 10 is 35. so the limit is going to be 31. and so that's it for that example but now what about this one what is the limit as x approaches 3 of x cubed minus 27 over x minus 3. now if we try to plug in 3 it's going to be 0 over 0 so we don't want to do that in this case if you have a fraction like this see if you can factor the expression so how can we factor x cubed minus 27 so what we have is a difference of cubes and whenever you see that you can use this formula aq minus b cubed is a minus b times a squared plus a b plus b squared so in our example a to the third is like x to the third and b to the third is 27. so a is the cube root of x cubed which is x and b is the cube root of 27 which is three so this is going to be x minus 3 and then a squared that's x squared and then plus a b so that's 3 times x and then plus b squared or 3 squared which is 9. so now we can cancel the factor x minus three so what we have left over is the limit as x approaches three of x squared plus three x plus nine so at this point we now can use direct substitution so it's three squared plus three times three plus nine which is nine plus nine plus nine adding nine three times is basically multiplying nine by three and so this limit is equal to twenty-seven now here's another problem that you can work on so what is the limit as x approaches three of one over x minus one over three divided by x minus three so for these examples feel free to pause the video if you want to and try these problems so in this example we have a complex fraction so what do you do in a situation like this if you get a complex fraction what i recommend is to multiply the top and the bottom by the common denominator of those two fractions that is by x and by 3. so i'm going to multiply the top and the bottom by 3x so if we multiply 3x by 1 over x the x variables will cancel and so what we're going to have left over is simply 3 and if we multiply 3x by 1 over 3 the 3s will cancel leaving behind x but there's a negative sign in front of it now for the terms on the bottom i'm going to leave it in its factored form so notice that 3 minus x and x minus 3 are very similar if you see a situation like this factor out a negative one if we take out a negative one the negative x will change to positive x and positive three will change to negative three so notice that we can cancel the x minus 3 factor at this point and so what we have left over is the limit as x approaches 3 of negative 1 over three x so now we can use direct substitution so let's replace x with three so it's going to be three times three which is nine so the final answer is negative one divided by nine so now you know how to evaluate limits that are associated with complex fractions so here's another example what is the limit as x approaches nine of square root x minus three over x minus nine so what should we do if we're dealing with square roots what i recommend is to multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate of the expression that has the square root so the conjugate of square root x minus 3 is square root x plus 3. so in the numerator we need to foil so the square root of x times the square root of x is the square root of x squared which is simply x and then we have the square root of x times three so that's going to be plus three square root x and then these two will form negative three square root x and finally we have negative three times positive three which is negative nine now on the bottom i'm not going to foil the two expressions i'm gonna leave it the way it is because my goal is to get rid of the x minus nine i want to cancel it so now negative three and positive three add up to zero so what we have left over is the limit as x approaches 9 of x minus 9 divided by x minus 9 times the square root of x plus 3. so now at this point notice that we can cancel x minus nine and so what we have left over is the limit as x approaches nine of one over square root x plus three so now what we can do is replace x with nine so i'm just going to continue up here so it's going to be 1 over square root 9 plus 3 and the square root of 9 is 3 and 3 plus three is six so the final answer is one over six now let's look at this example what is the limit as x approaches four of the expression one over square root x minus one over two divided by x minus four so this time we have a complex fraction with radicals that means we need to multiply the top and the bottom not only by the common denominator but also by the conjugate but let's start with a common denominator so i'm going to multiply the top and the bottom by these two that is by 2 square root x so when i multiply 1 over square root x times 2 square root x the square root x terms will cancel leaving behind positive two so i have the limit as x approaches four with a two on top and if i multiply these two the twos will cancel leaving behind the square root of x and so on the bottom i have 2 square root x times x minus 4. so now my next step is to multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate of the radical expression that is by 2 plus square root x now i'm only going to foil the top part not the bottom so we have 2 times 2 which is 4 and then we have 2 times the square root of x and then these two that's going to be negative 2 square root x and negative square root x times positive square root x is going to be negative square root x squared which is negative x and in the denominator don't foil just rewrite what you have if you follow these steps it won't be that difficult so now 2 and negative 2 adds up to 0. so what we have left over is the limit as x approaches 4 of 4 minus x divided by all the stuff that we have on the bottom now what we're going to do at this point is we're going to factor out a negative one so this is now the limit as x approaches four so negative one and this is going to change to positive x and plus 4 is going to change to negative 4 just like we did before so now notice that we can cancel the x plus four terms at this point so this is what we have left over so now let's replace x with four so it's negative one divided by two square root four times two plus square root four so the square root of four is two and two times two that's going to be four and two plus two is four and four times four is sixteen so the final answer is negative one divided by sixteen and so that's going to be the limit now let's talk about how to evaluate limits graphically so let's say if we want to calculate the limit as x approaches negative 3 from the left side and let's say this graph represents the function f of x so what can we do so to evaluate the limit you're looking for the y value so first identify where x is negative three x is negative 3 anywhere along that vertical line now we want to approach that vertical line from the left side so therefore you want to follow the curve from the left until you get to that point so notice that the y value here corresponds to positive one so therefore the limit as x approaches three from the left side is one now what about from the right side so you want to approach the vertical line at negative 3 from the right so we got to follow this curve so notice that the y value here is negative 3. so therefore the limit as x approaches negative three from the right side that's a negative three now what about the limit as x approaches negative three from either side if the left-sided limit and the right-sided limit are not the same then the limit does not exist so these two are known as one-sided limits now what about f of negative three what is the value of the function when x is negative three to find it identify the closed circle which has a y value of negative three so this is it now let's work on some more problems so what is the limit as x approaches negative two from the left side go ahead and try this one so identify the vertical line at negative two so we want to approach that line from the left side so notice that the y value is negative two so what is the limit as x approaches negative two from the right side so this time we want to approach the vertical line from the right and it points to the same value negative two so therefore the limit as x approaches negative two from either side does exist because these two they match so therefore it's going to be negative two now what is the function value when x is negative 2 so look for the closed circle that's on this vertical line and so that's this point where the y value is positive 2. so as you can see is not very difficult to evaluate limits graphically now let me give you a new set of problems evaluate the limit as x approaches positive one from the left side from the right side and from either side and also find the function value when x is one so x is one anywhere along that vertical line so if we approach it from the left side notice that the y value is positive one there and if we approach it from the right side the y value is three so because these two do not match the limit as x approaches one does not exist now the function value at one is the closed circle which has a y value of two now here's the last set of problems like this what is the limit as x approaches positive 3 from the left side and from the right side and from either side and then find the function value at 3. so notice that at x equals 3 we have this vertical asymptote so as x approaches 3 from the right i mean from the left side notice that it goes down to negative infinity and as we approach 3 from the right side it goes all the way up to positive infinity now these two do not match so therefore the limit does not exist and the function value at 3 is going to be undefined so a good example of having a vertical asymptote at x equals 3 would be a function like this one over x minus three and if you plug in three you're gonna get one over zero which is undefined so whenever you have a zero in the denominator at that point you have a vertical asymptote and it's undefined at that point now at negative 3 we have what is known as a jump discontinuity the graph doesn't connect at negative two we have what is known as a hole a hole is a removable discontinuity a jump discontinuity is not removable so this is another example of a jump discontinuity it's a non-removable discontinuity and here we have an infinite discontinuity which is also non-removable 

Transcript for: Introduction to Limits
let's talk about limits what exactly is a limit so let's say if we want to find the limit as x approaches 2 of the function x squared minus 4 divided by x minus two now this is different than plugging in two if you want to find the value of the function and when x is two you would substitute this would be 2 squared minus 4 divided by 2 minus 2. 2 squared is 4 and 4 minus 4 is 0 2 minus 2 is 0. 0 over 0 we don't know what that is it could be 0 it could be infinity it could be undefined it could be eight we don't know so the function is not defined at two when x is two we don't have a specific value however as x approaches 2 it does converge to a specific value let me explain so let's plug in a number that is not exactly 2 but something that's close to 2. and let's make a table so we're going to have our x values and the values of the function so let's just try 1.9 1.9 squared minus 4 divided by 1.9 minus 2. what does that equal if you type that in your calculator you should get 3.9 now let's pick a number that's even closer to 2. for example 1.99 let's see what's going to happen type this in your calculator to see what answer you get this will give you 3.99 now let's try 1.99 well 1.999 do you see a pattern what number is the limit converging to this is equal to 3.999 so notice that as x approaches 2 the expression x squared minus four over x minus two it approaches the number four it gets closer and closer to four so therefore the limit is four evaluate the limit as x approaches 3 of x cubed minus 27 divided by x minus 3. now we can't use direct substitution if we plug in 3 the way it is this will give us a 0 divided by 0 which is indeterminate and we can't find the value of that so we're not going to do it that way instead let's plug in numbers that are very close to three so let's start with 2.9 2.9 to the third power minus 27 divided by 2.9 minus 3. when you type this in feel free to use parentheses if you're not getting the answer that i have so this will give you 26.11 now what about when x gets closer to 3. let's try 2.99 let's see if it converges to a specific value so this will give you 26.91 and if we try 2.999 let's see what's going to happen by now you can see the answer so this is going to be 26.99 so therefore we can see that as x approaches 3 as it gets closer and closer to 3 the y value approaches 27 so therefore the limit as x approaches 3 of x cubed minus 27 over x minus 3 is equal to 27. what is the limit as x approaches 3 of the function x squared plus seven x plus three so we need to find the limit of this polynomial function how can we do so well the first thing that you should try to do is direct substitution plug in three if you don't get a zero on the bottom of a fraction then you should be fine in this case there is no fraction so we don't have to worry about that so we can use direct substitution to evaluate this limit analytically so if we plug in three it's going to be three squared plus seven times three plus three three squared is nine seven times three that's 21 and nine plus 21 is 30 and 30 plus three is 33 so therefore the limit as x approaches 3 for this function is 33. so as you can see direct substitution is a nice technique hopefully you'll get more questions like this on the test let's try another example let's say if the limit as x approaches five let's find it given this rational function x squared minus three x plus four divided by x plus two so let's go ahead and use direct substitution so this is going to be 5 squared minus 3 times 5 plus 4 divided by 5 plus 2. 5 squared that's 25 three times five is fifteen and five plus two is seven twenty five minus fifteen is ten ten plus four is fourteen so we got fourteen divided by seven which in the end is equal to two what is the limit as x approaches two square root x plus seven divided by x plus one go ahead and use direct substitution to get the answer so this is going to be the square root of two plus seven divided by two plus one now two plus seven is nine and two plus one is three the square root of 9 is 3 and 3 divided by 3 is 1. so that's the answer as you can see direct substitution is a nice simple and easy technique to use what is the limit of this particular trigonometric function sine x as x approaches pi over four now what is that equal to now it might be helpful to know what pi over four is in degrees to convert radians to degrees multiply it by 180 over pi so notice that the pi values cancel 180 divided by 4 is 45 degrees so basically you can plug in pi over 4 or 45. so what is sine 45 using a unit circle is equal to the square root of 2 divided by 2. you can also use your calculator to get that answer let's try another example what is the limit as x approaches pi over 3 of the function of tangent x now tangent is equivalent to sine divided by cosine so we could use direct substitution again so this is going to be sine pi over 3 divided by cosine pi over three so what is sine pi over three pi over three is sixty by the way 180 is the same as pi so 180 over 3 is 60. sine 60 is root 3 divided by 2 cosine six t is one half so if we multiply the top and the bottom by two these two will cancel we're going to get the square root of three on top and two times a half is one so the final answer is root three now what about this one the limit as x approaches pi over six of the function secant x now secant is equivalent to 1 divided by cosine so we can use direct substitution what is cosine pi divided by six pi over six or 180 divided by six is thirty cosine thirty is root three divided by two now what is one divided by root three over two to figure this out you can multiply the top and the bottom by two so on top one times two is two on the bottom the two's cancel so we have this two divided by root three now we need to rationalize it the square root of three times the square root of three is the square root of nine which is three so this is the answer two root three divided by three you 

Transcript for: Properties of Limits
now let's talk about how to evaluate limits using properties of limits for example let's say that the limit as x approaches a of the function f of x say that's equal to four and the limit as x approaches a of the function g of x let's say that's equal to negative 3. so using that information what is the limit as x approaches a of 4 f of x so what you're supposed to do is take the constant and move to the front so this is equivalent to four times the limit as x approaches a of f of x instinctively you know it's just four times four but if you want to show your work this is how you should write it now we can replace this expression with this value because that's what it equals to and so in the end it's 4 times 4 which is sixteen but some teachers will want you to write out every step and you just gotta do it that way here's another one what is the limit as x approaches a for this expression three f of x plus five g x let's rewrite it this is equivalent to 3 times the limit as x approaches a of f of x plus 5 times the limit as x approaches a of g of x so we know this is equal to four so what we have is three times four and this portion here is equal to negative three so that's plus five times negative three three times four is twelve five times negative three is negative fifteen and twelve minus fifteen is negative three try this one what is the limit as x approaches a of the expression f of x times g of x show your work as well now instinctively you know it's 4 times negative 3 which is negative 12. but to show your work write it like this first you want to separate f of x and g of x and then substitute so this is going to be 4 times negative 3 which is negative 12. now what about this one what is the limit as x approaches a of g of x raised to the fourth times the square root of f of x how can we rewrite the expression so first we have the limit as x approaches a of g of x which is all raised to the fourth power times the limit as x approaches a of f of x you can raise it to the one half or take the square root of the entire thing so this portion is equal to negative three so we have negative three raised to the fourth power times the square root of four negative three to the fourth power is eighty-one the square root of four is two so this is equal to one sixty-two here's another example what is the limit as x approaches a of f of x divided by g of x so how would you rewrite that expression to evaluate it here's what i would do to separate f and g i would write first the limit as x approaches a for f of x times the limit as x approaches a of one over g of x f times one over g is the same as f divided by g so we know the first part is simply equal to four the second part it's going to be one divided by negative three so the final answer is negative four over three and so now you know how to use properties of limits to evaluate limits you 

Transcript for: How To Find The Limit of a Polynomial Function - Calculus
in this lesson we're going to talk about how to find the limit of a polynomial function the simplest fastest way to do this is by direct substitution so let's work on this example now sometimes you may be required to show your work so here's what you can do we're going to break up this polynomial into three parts so this is going to be 4 times the limit as X approaches 2. of the variable x cubed and then minus 5 times the limit as X approaches 2. this is of x squared Plus for limit as X approaches 2 so the constant nine once you break it up like this you can now use direct substitution so the limit as X approaches 2 for X cubed that's just going to be 2 to the third power the limit as X approaches 2 for x squared will simply be 2 squared and the limit as X approaches 2 for the constant nine and that's going to remain nine because there's no X variable associated with the nine so now at this point we just have to do the math 2 to the third power two times two times two is eight two squared is four and so we have this now 4 times 8 is 32. 5 times 4 is 20. and 32 minus 20 is 12. and 12 plus 9. is 21. so that's how you can evaluate the limit of a polynomial function now let's work on another example problem for the sake of practice feel free to pause the video if you want to try this so we're going to have the limit as X approaches 4 of the polynomial function three x squared minus 2x Plus 7. so feel free to take a minute to work on this example problem so we're going to follow the same process this is going to be 3 times the limit as X approaches 4. of x squared minus 2 times the limit as X approaches 4. of x and then Plus the limit as X approaches 4 for the constant seven now let's use direct substitution so this is going to be three times four squared minus 2 times 4. 7 4 times 4 is 16. two times four is eight and three times sixteen is Forty-Eight negative 8 plus 7 is negative 1. 48 minus 1 is 47. so this is going to be the final answer for this problem so that's basically it for this video now you know how to evaluate the limit of a polynomial function and you simply need to use direct substitution now for those of you who want more example problems on evaluating limits this could be limits of rational functions limits of trigonometric functions limits at Infinity feel free to check out the links in the description section below I'm going to be posting more video content relating to this topic 

Transcript for: How To Evaluate Limits From a Graph
now let's talk about how to find the value of a limit from a graph let's just make some points first so let's say if we have an open circle at this point a closed circle and also another open circle what is the limit as x approaches 2 from the left side so this is known as a one-sided limit and let's call this function f of x so basically this question is asking you as x approaches 2 from the left what is the y value so here is an x value of 2 as we approach it from the left side notice that the y value of that curve is three this is one two three now what is the limit as x approaches two from the right side of f of x now if we follow the curve from the right side as we approach an x value of 2 notice that the y value is negative 4. now how about the limit as x approaches 2 from either side because the left side and the right side do not match this limit does not exist now what about the value of f of 2 when x is exactly 2 what is the y value so we have to look at the closed circle the y value is 1 so f of 2 is equal to 1. now let's try another example let's say if we have an open circle at that point and a closed circle here what is the limit as x approaches positive 3 from the left side and this is the graph of f of x so here is an x value of three as we approach it from the left side notice that the y value is two so this is equal to two now what is the limit as x approaches three from the right side so as we approach an x value of 3 from the right side the y value is still 2. now what is the limit as x approaches 3 from either side because these two values are the same the limit exists it's equal to 2. finally what is the value of f of 3 when x is exactly three what is the value of y so whenever you get a question like that look for the closed circle the closed circle has a y value of four so f of three is equal to four consider this one so what is the limit as x approaches 2 from the left side and what is the limit as x approaches 2 from the right side and then find the limit as x approaches 2 from either side and in addition to that find the value of f of 2. so go ahead and pause the video go ahead and find the answers to these problems so let's start with the first one so here's an x value of two as we approach that point from the left side notice that the y value is also two now as we approach x equals two from the right side the y value is still two so therefore the limit as x approaches two from either side must be two as well because the left side and the right side have the same y value now what is the value of f of 2 so when x is exactly 2 what is the y value notice that there's no closed circle in this particular example so therefore it does not exist if you don't see a closed circle at an x equals two f of two is not defined now let's look at a fourth example what is the limit as x approaches 4 from the left side and also find the limit as x approaches 4 from the right side and as x approaches 4 from either side and also find the value of f 4. so what is the limit as x approaches 4 from the left looking at the graph here's an x value of four so as we approach from the left side notice that the y value is approximately negative two now as we approach positive four from the right side the y value is still negative two so the limit exists since the left side is the same as the right side the limit as x approaches four from either side is also negative two now what about f of four notice that we do have a closed circle at x equals four so it's also equal to negative two so therefore everything is the same the function is continuous at an x value of four here's another problem you can try so what is the limit as x approaches 3 from the left side let's start with that so what do you think it's equal to so here's three it's the vertical asymptote and as we follow the curve as we approach three from the left side notice that it doesn't converge to a specific y value it keeps getting lower and lower and lower so therefore it goes to negative infinity now what about the limit as x approaches 3 from the right side if we follow the curve towards the vertical asymptote with an x value of 3 notice that it keeps going higher and higher and higher so therefore it approaches positive infinity now what is the limit as x approaches 3 from either side because these two do not match the limit does not exist now what about f of 3 we don't have any closed circle at x equals 3 so therefore f 3 is not defined it doesn't exist let's try another similar example what is the limit as x approaches positive 4 from the left side given the graph of f of x so here is the x value of four and as we approach it notice that the curve increases it keeps getting higher and higher so the y value approaches infinity that is positive infinity now as we analyze the limit as x approaches 4 from the right side as we follow the curve towards positive 4 from the right it also keeps going higher and higher it goes towards positive infinity so therefore what is the limit as x approaches 4 from either side since these two are the same you can see that it approaches positive infinity now granted infinity is not really a number i mean you infinity could be a million a billion a trillion or just something that just it's never ending it's just keep increasing so because it does a conversion specific value you could also say that this limit does not exist some textbooks will have this answer some will have infinity so infinity really doesn't exist it's just a way of describing what happens as x approaches four that is the curve gets bigger and bigger and bigger the y value that i say it gets higher and higher and higher and we know that f of 4 is undefined it doesn't exist we don't have a closed circle at x equals 4. now let's work on some examples with horizontal asymptotes so let's say if we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals three and another one at y equals negative four and let's say the first graph well let's say we have a curve that looks like this actually what is the limit as x approaches positive infinity what is the answer so this is saying when x gets very large that means as we follow the curve all the way to the right and what is the y value notice that it approaches the horizontal asymptote so it has a y value of 3. now what about the limit as x approaches negative infinity so if we follow the curve all the way to the right notice that the y value that it approaches is negative 4. so that's how you can evaluate limits at infinity when x becomes very large you need to find the y value of the horizontal asymptote when y becomes very large when y approaches infinity you need to look for the vertical asymptote 

Transcript for: Evaluating Limits By Factoring
let's try this problem what is the limit as x approaches zero of the function five x divided by x squared plus two x now we can't use direct substitution here because if we plug in zero we're gonna have zero divided by zero which is indeterminate so we're not going to do that instead we can evaluate this limit analytically by factoring there's nothing to factor on the top that is on the numerator of the fraction so we're not going to change it but in the denominator we can take out the gcf the greatest common factor so if we take out an x x squared divided by x is x and 2x divided by x is positive two now notice that we can cancel an x variable and so we'll be left with the limit as x approaches 0 of 5 divided by x plus 2. now we can use direct substitution once you replace x with 0 there's no need to rewrite this limit expression now some teachers are picky about this so you have to rewrite it until you replace x with this number so the final answer is 5 divided by 2 that's the limit of this expression now what about this one what is the limit as x approaches 2 of x squared plus 3x minus 10 divided by x minus 2. so we can't plug in a 2. if we do we're going to get a 0 in the denominator and it's going to be undefined so we got a factor how can we factor this trinomial to do so find two numbers that multiply to 10 but add to 3. numbers that multiply to ten are five and two now we can make it negative five and positive two or positive five and negative two now we wanna make it positive five and negative two because those two numbers add up to positive 3. so therefore x squared plus 3x minus 10 can be factored as x plus 5 times x minus 2. and we need to rewrite the limit expression so notice that we can cancel the factor x minus two and so we're left with the limit as x approaches two of x plus five so now we can use direct substitution we're not going to get a 0 in the denominator anymore so it's going to be 2 plus 5 which is 7. so that's the limit here's another problem that you could try what is the limit as x approaches three of x squared minus nine divided by x minus three so what do you think what is the answer to this problem well we need to factor x squared minus nine and we can use the difference of perfect squares formula so for example if you have a squared minus b squared it's going to be a plus b times a minus b so for example let's say if we have x squared minus 25 the square root of x squared is x the square root of 25 is 5 and one is going to be positive and the other is going to be negative that's how you can factor it so for the example that we have the square root of x squared as we said before is x and the square root of nine is three and so it's going to be x plus three and x minus three so we can cancel with the three on the bottom and now we're left over with the limit as x approaches 3 of x plus 3. and now let's use direct substitution so it's going to be 3 plus 3 which is equal to 6. and so that's how we can evaluate this particular limit what is the limit as x approaches 2 of x cubed minus 8 divided by x minus 2. what would you do in that case so what we need to do is factor the difference of perfect cubes and the formula that we need to use is this one a q minus b cubed is a minus b times a squared plus a b plus b squared so in this case a cube is x cubed b to the third is eight so a is the cube root of x cubed which is x and the b is the cube root of eight which is two a squared that's x times x which is x squared a b that's x times two or two x and b squared is two squared which is four so therefore we have the expression the limit as x approaches two x minus two times x squared plus two x plus four divided by x minus two all right let's get rid of this stuff on the bottom and now we can cancel the x minus two factor so we have the limit as x approaches 2 of this remaining expression and now let's use direct substitution so this is equal to 2 squared plus two times two plus four two squared is four two times two is four and four plus four plus four three times is the same as four times three which is twelve and so that's the limit as x approaches 2 of this expression so you need to be familiar with the different factoring techniques that you've learned in a typical algebra course now let's try this one what is the limit as x approaches 4 of 4 minus x divided by x squared minus 16. so take a minute and pause the video see if you can get this one right so what do you think we need to do here so looking at x squared minus 16 we can see that we have a difference of perfect squares situation so to factor it it's going to be x plus 4 times x minus four but four minus x and x minus four they don't really cancel at the present moment however what we can do is factor out a negative one if we take out a negative one in the front and then reverse the order of four minus x notice that if you take a negative from negative x you're gonna get positive x if you take a negative from positive four it changes to negative four so by factoring out a negative one we now can cancel x minus four and so what we have left over is the limit as x approaches four of negative one divided by x plus four and so this is going to be negative one over four plus four and four plus four is eight so the answer is negative one divided by eight now what is the limit as x approaches 4 of the expression x squared minus x minus 12 divided by x squared plus x minus 20. so we just need to factor completely let's go ahead and factor this expression so what two numbers multiply to negative 12 but add to the middle coefficient negative one so we know four times three is twelve but we need to make the four negative because negative four plus positive three is negative one so this is going to be x minus four times x plus now what two numbers multiply it to negative 20 but add to one well we know 5 times 4 is 20 but we need to make it positive 5 and negative 4 because that's going to add up to 1. so it's x plus 5 times x minus 4. so we can cancel x minus 4 and so we're left with the limit as x approaches 4 of x plus 3 divided by x plus 5. so if we plug in four it's going to be four plus three over four plus five now four plus three we know it's seven four plus five is nine and so that's the answer seven divided by nine what is the limit as x approaches negative one of the expression two x squared minus x minus three over x plus one so what can we do here what would you do so first we can't plug in negative one because on the bottom it's going to give us zero and so that's undefined but we need to factor this trinomial but notice that the leading coefficient is not one so the way in which we factor it is going to be different so first let's multiply two times negative three two times negative three is negative six what two numbers multiply to negative six but add to the middle coefficient of negative one this is going to be negative three and two so to factor it we're gonna replace the middle term negative x with positive 2x minus 3x next let's factor by grouping in the first two terms take out the gcf which is 2x and so you'll be left with x plus and the last two terms take out the greatest common factor which is negative three and so you're gonna get x plus one next factor out x plus one so we're gonna write it once if we take out x plus 1 from the first term we'll be left with 2x if we take it out from the second term we're going to have negative 3 left over so therefore we could say this is equal to the limit as x approaches negative 1 x plus 1 times two x minus three divided by x plus one so now we can cancel x plus one and so we're left with the limit as x approaches negative one of two x minus three so now let's use direct substitution so this is gonna be two times negative one minus three which is negative two minus three and that's equal to negative five so that's the final answer

what is the limit as X approaches 4 of < TK x - 2 over x - 4 so what should you do under these circumstances we can't Factor this expression so how can we simplify if we plug in four 4 - 4 is zero the function will be undefined so we can't use direct substitution we don't want a zero in the bottom whenever you have a radical what you need to do is multiply by the conjugate the conjugate of otk x - 2 is the < TK of x + 2 and whatever you do to the top you must also do to the bottom so on top we're going to foil x * X or rather the square < TK of x * the otk of X is the < TK of x^2 which simplifies to X and then rootx * 2 that's going to be positive2 < tkx these 2 that's going to produce -2 < tkx and finally -2 * -2 is -4 now on the bottom we're not going to foil we're simply going to rewrite it exactly the way it is now 2un x + 2un X these two cancel and so we'll left with the limit as X approaches 4 of x - 4 / x - 4 * the < TK of x + 2 so now these two expressions will cancel and so we're left with the limit as X approaches 4 of 1 / the square root of x + 2 so at this point we can use direct substitution so that's going to be equal to 1 / the < TK 4 + 2 which theun of 4 is 2 so we have 2 + 2 which is 4 so the final answer is 1 over 4 let's work on another problem what is the limit as X approaches Z of the < TK x + 2 - < tk2 / X so we can't plug in zero otherwise we'll get a zero in the bottom so we got to get rid of that X somehow so just like before we're going to multiply the top and a bottom by the conjugate of the numerator so on top let's foil so when we multiply these two the sare otk of x + 2 * the square root of x + 2 that's simply going to equal x + 2 and then if we multiply these two together we're going to have < tk2 * < TK x + 2 I'm just going to leave it like that and if we multiply these two we can see that the middle terms will cancel and finally < tk2 * POS < tk2 isun 4 which is -2 on the bottom don't distribute simply rewrite it the way it is now these two terms will add up to zero positive2 and negative -2 adds up to zero so now what we have left over is this expression at this point we can cancel X and once the X in the bottom is gone we can now use direct substitution in The Next Step so this is going to be let's make some space so this is equal to 1 over < TK 0 + 2 + < tk2 0 + 2 is 2 now what is the square < TK of 2 plus the < TK of two the coefficient in front of both of them is 1 1 + 1 is 2 so this is going to be 1 over 2 < tk2 now that's your final answer but you could rationalize it if you want to so let's multiply the top and the bottom byun2 the < TK of two * the < TK of two is 2 and 2 * 2 is 4 so it's going to be < tk2 ID 4 that is the final answer now let's talk about the limit of rational functions let's say if we want to find the limit as X approaches 3 of 1x - 1 3 / xus 3 how can we do so as we could see we cannot use direct substitution and the denominator is going to be 3 - 3 which is zero and it will be undefined so what should we do under these circumstances what we need to do is we need to multiply the top and the Bottom by the common denominator of of these two fractions which is going to be 3x notice what happens if we do so so let's distribute 3x * 1 /x is equal to 3 3x is the same as 3x over 1 these will cancel and you'll be left with three so we're going to have a three on top and then 3x * 1 3 the 3es cancel leaving behind an X now we're not going to distribute the 3x on the bottom we're just going to leave it in its factored form and let's not forget to rewrite the limit expression now notice that 3 - x is similar to x - 3 but it's not exactly the same so what we need to do is we need to factor out the GCF in this case negative 1 if we take out negative 1 and reverse 3 and XGA X will become positive X and positive3 will change tog3 so now at this point we can cancel xus 3 so we're left with the limit as X approaches zero I mean not Zer but 3 of -1 over 3x and now we can use direct substitution so it's -1 / 3 * 3 and so the final answer is -1/ 9 let's try another similar example for the sake of practice so this time we're going to have the limit as X approaches Z 1 / x + 2 minus 1/ 2 / X so go ahead and and try this problem so notice that the common denominator between these two fractions is x + 2 * 2 so let's multiply the top and the Bottom by x + 2 and 2 so now if we distribute these two will cancel leaving behind a two so we're going to have the limit as X approaches zero with a two on top and when we multiply these two this time the twos will cancel leaving behind X+ 2 with a negative sign in front of it on the bottom we're going to have an x a two and an X plus2 we're not going to distribute anything on the bottom now let's distribute the negative sign on top to uh these two terms so now we have the limit as X approaches zero and that's going to be 2 - x - 2 / 2x * x + 2 so positive2 and negative -2 will add up to zero so we can get rid of those two now now in the next step we can cancel something else notice that we can get rid of an X once we get rid of the X on the bottom we can now substitute at this point so we have -1 / 2 * x + 2 so this is equal to 1 / 2 * 0 + 2 which is 0 + 2 is the same as 2 and 2 * 2 is 4 so the final answer is -1 / 4 for

how can we evaluate this limit what is the limit as x approaches nine for the function one over square root x minus one over three divided by x minus nine feel free to try this problem if you want to now in this problem we have radicals and we have fractions what do you think is the first thing that we need to do in order to evaluate the limit well you could try direct substitution if you plug in 9 you're going to get 9 minus 9 on the bottom and on the top 1 over the square root of 9 minus 1 over 3. the square root of nine is three and so you're going to get zero over zero which that's really not going to help us so direct substitution is not going to work in this example now because we have a complex fraction that is fractions within a fraction what we want to do is we want to get rid of those fractions and we can do this by multiplying the top and the bottom of the large fraction by the common denominator of these two fractions and so we're going to multiply the numerator by 3 square root x and whatever you do to the top you must also do to the bottom so we're going to multiply the denominator by 3 square root x 3 square root x times 1 over square root x these two will cancel leaving behind three so we're gonna have the limit as x approaches nine we're gonna have a three on top now three square root x times 1 over 3 the 3's will cancel and so we're going to get negative square root x on the bottom we have x minus 9 times 3 square root x so we no longer have a complex fraction but we still have radicals in this problem how do we get rid of the radicals or the square root symbols what you want to do at this point is you want to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of this expression to find the conjugate it's going to be 3 plus square root x it's exactly what you see here but you need to change the negative sign into a positive sign so we're going to multiply the denominator by the same thing so now let's foil we're going to have 3 times 3 which is 9 and then 3 times the square root of x that's going to cancel with negative 3 square root x but i'm going to write it out and then negative square root x times square root x that's just going to be negative x on the bottom we have x minus nine times three square root x and then 3 plus square root x so these two will cancel and so we're just going to be left with 9 minus x on the numerator now what we're going to do is we're going to factor out a negative 1 from 9 minus x if we take out negative 1 the negative x will become positive x the positive nine will become negative nine so as you can see at this point we can cancel x minus nine and so what we now have is the limit as x approaches 9 of negative 1 over 3 square root x times 3 plus square root x so at this point we can now replace x with 9 because we're not going to get a 0 in the denominator of the fraction so this is going to be negative 1 over 3 square root nine times three plus the square root of nine the square root of nine is three and three times three is nine three plus three is six nine times six is fifty four so the answer for this problem is negative one over fifty four and if you want to you can check this answer negative 1 over 54 as a decimal that's equal to negative 0.0185 repeating now if we plug in 9.1 into the function if you type this into your calculator 1 over the square root of 9.1 minus one over three divided by nine point one minus nine this is going to give you negative point zero one eight three six five six and then if you plug in 9.01 which will be this right here this will give you negative 0.01 as you can see as x approaches 9 the function approaches this value negative 0.0185 now if you want to check it from the left side that is if you want to plug in 8.99 you should get negative 0.018534 so this just confirms that our answer is indeed correct so now you know how to evaluate limits that contain fractions and radicals so that's it for this video thanks again for watching 

Transcript for: Evaluating Limits With Fractions and Square Roots
now what about the limit as x approaches 4 of 1 over square root x minus 1 over 2 divided by x minus 4. so this time we have a rational function we have fractions and we have a square root so typically when we have a square root we would multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate and when we have fractions we need to multiply the top and the bottom by a common denominator in this example we need to do both you can do it in any order but personally i like to get rid of the fractions first so i'm going to multiply by the common denominator of these two fractions so that's root x times two or simply 2 root x so if we multiply this fraction by 2 root x we can see that root x will cancel and so we're going to have the limit as x approaches 4 of 2 on top and then if we multiply these two fractions i mean the fraction 1 over 2 with 2 root x the twos will cancel leaving behind root x and on the bottom we're just gonna write it as x minus four times two root x so now at this point we need to multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate of the numerator so instead of 2 minus root x is going to be 2 plus root x so on the top we're going to foil 2 times 2 that's going to be equal to 4. let's not forget to rewrite the limit expression and then 2 times root x that's positive 2 root x and multiplying those two this is going to give us negative 2 root x and root x times your x is simply x both negative in front now we're not going to change anything on the bottom we're simply just going to rewrite it exactly the way it was the two middle terms 2 root x and negative two with x these cancel they add up to zero now let's write what we have left over on the top we have a 4 minus x on the bottom nothing changed so notice that 4 minus x and x minus 4 are very similar so just by looking at it you know at this point that we need to take out a negative one if we do so negative x will become positive x positive four will change to negative 4. once we get rid of the x minus 4 on the bottom then we could use direct substitution so this disappears that turns into one so now we have the limit as x approaches four of negative one divided by two root x times two plus the square root of x so this is going to be negative one divided by two square root four times two plus square root four now the square root of four is equal to two so inside the parentheses we have two plus two two times two that's going to be four and two plus two is also four four times four is sixteen so the final answer is negative one divided by sixteen let's try another problem let's look for the limit as x approaches six of one divided by the square root of x plus three minus one over three divided by x minus six so let's try that go ahead and take a minute and work on this example so just like before we have a fraction with a square root so i'm going to begin by multiplying the top and the bottom by the common denominator of these two fractions so that's going to be 3 and the square root of x plus 3. so initially these two will cancel and that's going to leave behind the limit as x approaches six we're going to have a three on top and then these will cancel leaving behind the square root of x plus three and on the bottom it's just going to be x minus 6 times 3 root x plus 3. next let's multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate which is three plus the square root of x plus three so on the top we need to foil three times three that's going to be nine and then if we multiply those two it's going to be positive three square root x plus three now let's multiply these two terms that's going to be negative three square root x plus three and then the square root of x plus three times itself it's simply x plus three with a negative sign in front on the bottom we have three root x plus three times x minus six times three plus the square root of x plus three now we can cancel these two those are going to add up to zero so we have the limit as x approaches six now let's distribute the negative sign to x plus three so we have nine minus x minus three divided by three root x plus three times x minus six times three plus the square root of x plus three now in the numerator let's go ahead and combine like terms nine minus three is equal to six so what we have is six minus x divided by everything else so what do you think we need to do in the next step notice that six minus x is very similar to x minus six which means you know what to do we need to take out a negative one so that negative x will become positive x and positive six will change into negative six so now at this point we can cancel x minus six x minus six divided by itself is equal to one and that one times negative one is negative one so now we're left over with the limit as x approaches six with a negative one on top divided by 3 square root x plus 3 times 3 plus the square root of x plus 3. now we can use substitution so this is equal to negative one divided by three times the square root of six plus three times three plus the square root of six plus three now six plus three is equal to nine and we know what the square root of nine is equal to that's equal to three so we got three times three and then three plus three three times three is nine three plus three is six nine times six is equal to 54. so that is our final answer negative 1 divided by 54. now let's confirm our answer of negative 1 divided by 54. let's get the decimal value of that number if you type it in your calculator it's about negative point zero one eight five and then it repeats one eight five and so forth now original problem was this the limit as x approaches six of one over the square root of x plus three minus 1 over 3 divided by x minus 6. so what we're going to do is we're going to plug in a number that's very close to 6. let's try 6.1 to begin with so go ahead and type this in your calculator you may wish to use parentheses so i got negative point zero one eight 6 so forth so you can see it's close but now let's try something closer like 6.01 let's see if it gets closer to our answer so i got negative point zero one eight five zero three as you can see this answer is very close to the actual answer which means that this is correct as x gets closer and closer to 6 it's going to approach this number so you can always use direct substitution to confirm your answer as long as you plug in a number that's very very close to this number

consider the problem on the board what is the limit as x approaches 3 given the function that we have the square root of 12 minus x minus 3 over the square root of 7 minus x minus 2. how can we evaluate that limit feel free to pause the video if you want to try this problem yourself well we could start with direct substitution to see if that's going to work so let's replace x with three so we're gonna have 12 minus three minus three divided by the square root of seven minus three minus two now twelve minus three is nine seven minus three is four the square root of nine is three and the square root of four is two so three minus three is zero the same is true for two minus two zero divided by zero we don't really know what that's going to be we don't know if that's going to be 1 infinity 0 undefined so this is indeterminate we can't do anything with this right now so we're going to need to do something else now when you want to evaluate a limit that has radicals and fractions what you want to do is you want to multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate of that radical the conjugate of the square root of seven minus x minus two is going to be the square root of seven minus x plus two so all you need to do is change the sign from negative to positive you simply need to reverse it now since we're multiplying the denominator of the fraction by this value we need to do the same thing with the numerator of the fraction so that the value of the entire fraction doesn't change that's just one of those rules of algebra that we need to follow now the numerator we're not going to do anything there we're not going to foil these two expressions so we're just going to rewrite it the way it is now the stuff that's on the bottom that's a different story we want to foil it because it will simplify the square root of 7 minus x times itself is simply just seven minus x the square root function will cancel now the square root of seven minus x times positive 2 that's going to cancel with negative 2 times the square root of 7 minus x but for this example problem i'm going to write it down so you can see it so we're going to have these two which will cancel and then finally negative two times two is negative four so that's what we have at this point two minus two is zero so those will disappear so let's simplify the result so we have the limit as x approaches 3 of the square root of 12 minus x minus 3 times the square root of 7 minus x plus 2 and then we have 7 minus x minus four now seven minus four is three so this simplifies to three minus x at this point we cannot use direct substitution if we were to plug in 3 into this expression we're going to get 3 minus 3 which is 0 and having a 0 in the denominator of a fraction will make the entire expression undefined so we can't do anything right now with that but there is something else that we can do and we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of this radical that was the radical that was in the beginning so we're going to multiply the top by the square root of 12 minus x but instead of minus 3 it's going to be plus 3. and whatever you do to the top you must also due to the bottom as well so now what we're going to do is we're going to foil those two factors so we're going to have the limit as x approaches 3. now the square root of 12 minus x times itself will simply be 12 minus x and then this is going to be plus 3 square root 12 minus x and then minus 3 square root 12 minus x and then negative 3 times 3 is negative 9. now these terms cancel and also we can see that 12 minus 9 is 3. so that whole expression becomes 3 minus x whoops let's go back okay why is this acting like this so we're going to have 3 minus x on top now we still have this expression the square root of seven minus x plus two on the bottom we have three minus x and the square root of twelve minus x plus three so we can cancel those two factors now at this point we could use direct substitution to get our final answer so this is going to be the square root of 7 minus 3 plus two divided by the square root of twelve minus three plus two now seven minus three is four twelve minus three is nine the square root of four is two the square root of nine i made a mistake this should be a three somehow that two became a three i wasn't paying attention the square root of nine is three now two plus two is four three plus three is six and so this is our answer but we need to reduce the fraction four is two times two six is two times three two divided by two is one and so we're left with two over three so this is the final answer two over three is basically 0.6 repeating now we can check our work by plugging in numbers into the original expression so let me rewrite the original problem it was the limit as x approaches 3 of the square root of 12 minus x minus 3 and then divided by the square root of 7 minus x minus 2. so this method that we're going to use to check our work is very useful if you have a multiple choice problem or multiple choice tests and you're not sure how to evaluate the limit if you're allowed to use the calculator plug-in numbers can always help you to evaluate the limit so as x approaches 3 what we want to do is plug in a number that's very close to 3. so let's say that this is f x let's evaluate that function at 3.1 so this is going to be the square root of 12 minus 3.1 and then minus 3 divided by the square root of 7 minus 3.1 minus 2. so go ahead and plug this in to your calculator so i got point six six four three two four one two seven one which is close to point six repeating but just to make sure we want to try another value we want to make sure that it's approaching 0.6 repeating so let's pick a number that is closer to 3. so a number that's closer to 3 as opposed to 3.1 would be 3.01 so go ahead and type this in so i got point six six six four three four nine one one five as you could see it's definitely getting close to point six repeating and if you really wanna be sure you could tr you could try this number three point zero zero one so for this i got point six six six six four three five one five eight so clearly you can see a pattern here so that just confirms that the answer that we have is indeed correct so now you know how to evaluate a limit problem that has radicals in it we need to do

what is the limit as X approaches 3 of the absolute value of x minus 3 for this problem we can simply use direct substitution there's nothing stopping us from doing so so this is simply the absolute value of 3us 3 which is the absolute value of zero and that is zero now what about this one what is the limit as X approaches Z of the absolute value of x / X in this case we can't use direct substitution 0 over Z what is that going to be it could be eight it can be one it can be zero it could be undefined so we we can't just plug it in now what we need to do is determine the limit from the left side and the right side in order to figure this out so let's start with the left side now what we can do is plug in a number so left of zero we can plug in .1 the absolute value of .1 /1 what is that the absolute value of1 is positive1 if we divide pos1 by1 this is equal to1 and so that's the left side limit the limit as X approaches zero from the left of the absolute value of x/x is Nega 1 now what about the right side well let's try plugging in positive .1 the absolute value of positive1 will remain pos1 1 / .1 is pos1 so that's the right side limit now because the left side and the right side are not the same therefore this limit does not exist so that is the answer that's how you can evaluate these types of limits you got to check the left side and the right side something else that can help you is to realize that the absolute value of x is really you could break it up into a piece function it's equal tox and postive X it's when X is less than Z and it's positive X when X is greater than zero so therefore when you have the absolute value of x overx this is equal to postive X overx which is 1 when X is less than Z and it's equal tox / X which is -1 when X is greater than Z so therefore you can turn this into a peie wise function you could say this is Nega 1 when X is less than zero and positive 1 when X is greater than zero so to graph it it looks like this on the left side the graph is at ne1 and on the right side equals to POS 1 and that is why the limit as X approaches Z from the left was equal to negative 1 that's why we got that answer as you approach negative as you approach Zero from the left side the Y value is Nega 1 and the limit as X approaches zero from the right side was positive one because as you approach Zero from the right side you can see that the Y value is going to be positive one so if you graph it it can help you to figure this out so just remember any time you have the absolute value of a function you can break it up into the positive version of the function or the negative version let's work on another example what is the limit as X approaches 5 from the right of the absolute value of x - 5 / x - 5 so this time we're just trying to figure out the one side limit not the left side or not as X approaches five from either side we only want the answer as X approaches five from the right so go ahead and try that now keep in mind the absolute value of x - 5 we can write it as positive x - 5 or Nega x - 5 when X is greater than 5 this one holds true and this one applies when X is less than 5 so therefore the absolute value of x - 5 can be equal to one of two things if we make it positive x - 5 then this is going to be positive 1 and if we make ITX - 5 these two will cancel and you're going to get negative 1 so when you see a problem like this the answer is either is one of two answers it's either one or negative one and if you ever get confused a simple way is just to plug in a number so five to the right we need to plug in something that's bigger than five let's try 5.1 5.1 - 5 is positive1 the absolute value of positive .1 is 0.1 and 0.1 / 0.1 is 1 so this is the right side limit as X approaches five from the right side this is going to equal positive 1 what is the limit as X approaches 4 from the left of the absolute value of x x - 4 over x - 4 so in this case let's plug in a number that's less than four like 3.9 3.9 minus 4 that's .1 and the absolute value of negative .1 is positive1 so therefore this is going to equal ne1 now what about the limit as X approaches three from either side so to do this we need to evaluate the left side and the right side as X approaches three from the left we need to plug in 2.9 so this is going to be the absolute value of 2.9 minus 3 / 2.9 minus 3 so then this is going to be .1 /1 which turns into positive1 /1 and that's equal to1 from the left side the limit as X approaches three from the right side based on all the examples that you've seen so far you know what the answer is going to be this is going to be postive .1 over .1 which is POS 1 so because the left and right side limits do not match this limit does not exist what about the limit as X approaches -2 from the left of the absolute value of x + 2 / X+ 2 try that problem so what number should we plug in if X approaches -2 from the left let's make a number line here's -2 here's -3 and here's 1 on the number line so from the left side notice that we need to pick a number between -3 and -2 but close to -2 so we can use -2.1 so we're going to have the absolute value of -2.1 + 2 / -2.1 + 2 so that's going to be 2.1 + 2 is .1 the absolute value of .1 is pos1 positive1 /1 is negative 1 so that's the answer now if you want to do it another way you can do it this way as well so you can write a peie wise function and make the statement that the absolute value of X+ 2 can be any one of these two expressions it's x + 2 when X is greater than -2 to find this number set the inside that is the x + 2 equal to Z and solve for x and that's where you get -2 from now when X is less than -2 you're going to have the negative version of the function since we're approaching --2 from the left side we need to use this part of the function because on the left side x is less than -2 so therefore we could say this is x + 2 / x + 2 and these two will cancel giving us negative 1 you can do it that way if you want to here's another example what is the limit as X approaches 3 from the right of the absolute value of 3 - x / x - 3 so what can we do in that case well if we turn it into a peie wise function at least this part we could see that if we set 3 - x equal to Z x will equal 3 so at 3 the function changes so there's two versions we can have Nega 3 - x and positive 3 - x now when X is let's say two that is when X is less than 3 3 - x is positive which is okay we need to use a negative sign to make it positive because an absolute value function will make a negative value positive when X is greater than 3 like 4 3 - x is 3 - 4 is Nega 1 so we need to put the negative in front of it to make it positive so when X is larger than 3 we're going to get that expression so 3 to the right is bigger than three so therefore we need to use this so this is going to be negative 3 - x X - 3 if we distribute the negative sign and reverse the two numbers negative * X becomes positive X and then we're going to have -3 these two cancel so the answer should be one now let's confirm it using direct substitution so three to the right let's plug in 3.1 so this is going to be 3.1 rather 3 minus 3.1 and on the bottom 3.1 - 3 3 - 3.1 is .1 and 3.1 - 3 is uh pos1 the absolute value of .1 is positive1 pos1 / positive. one is one so that's the answer here's another problem that you could try evaluate the limit as X approaches one from either side of the expression x^2 - one / the absolute value of x - one go ahead and try that take a minute pause the video and work on it so first let's start with the absolute value of x - one now we can write it as positive x -1 or negative x -1 and if we set X - 1 equal to Z we could see that it's going to change at one so when X is greater than one we're going to get a positive value if we plug it into this let's say if we plug in two 2 - 1 is positive now when X is less than one let's say if we plug in a zero this will be negative which we don't want we want a positive answer if we plug in 0 here 0 - 1 is 1 * the ne 1 outside that's going to make it positive so we want X to be less than one for the negative version now let's evaluate the limit as X approaches one from the right side to begin with if we do so we can use this portion because on the right side x is greater than one so the absolute value of x -1 will just be positive x -1 and we could Factor the numerator that's x + 1 * x -1 so therefore these will cancel and then what we'll have is the limit as X approaches one from the right of x + 1 so we can use direct substitution 1 + 1 is 2 so on the right side the limit is equal to positive2 so keep that answer in mind now let's evaluate the limit from the right side using direct substitution so let's use 1.01 because it has to be bigger than one but very close to one let's confirm the answer that we have which was positive2 1.01 2us 1 that's going to be a about positive2 01 and 1.01 - 1 that's just positive 01 if we divide these two numbers this is going to be 2.01 which is very close to positive2 so that means that the answer that we had before was correct if we plug in a number that's even closer to one like 1.001 the answer should be very close to pos2 now let's evaluate the limit as X approaches one from the left side so the numerator can be factored the same way x + 1 xus one and the denominator this time we're going to use Negative X - one because one from the left is less than one so this is going to be negative x - one and we can get rid of the stuff on the bottom at this point we're not going to use it anymore so let's cancel these two and so we have the limit as X approaches 1 from the left x + 1 / 1 so if we plug in one now it's going to be 1 + 1 over1 so 2 /1 this is -2 now let's confirm it using direct substitution using the original expression so one from the left that's like 99 so 9^ 2 -1 / the absolute value of 99 -1 99 2 minus one is about 0199 099 minus 1 is01 but with the absolute value it changes to positive 01 and if we divide those two numbers this will equal 1.99 which rounds to -2 so on the right side it was pos2 but as X approaches 1 from the left side it's -2 therefore this limit does not exist 

Transcript for: Limits of Exponential Functions | Calculus
here's a question for you what is the limit as x approaches 0 of the expression 4 raised to the 3x minus 3 raised to the 4x divided by x feel free to take a minute if you want to try this problem yourself so we could start with direct substitution let's replace x with zero three times zero is zero and four times zero is zero now what is four raised to the zero power anything raised to the zero power is one so four to the zero is one three to the zero is one 1 minus 1 is 0. and 0 divided by 0 we really don't know what that is that could be 0 it could be infinity it could be 5 it could be negative 8. we just don't know so this is called indeterminate we can't determine what it is now whenever you have one of the indeterminate types such as zero over zero or infinity over infinity and when you're dealing with limits you could use something called l'hopital's rule or l'hopital's rule and what you need to do in order to apply l'hopital's rule is you need to take the derivative of the numerator and of the denominator separately you're not using the chain rule or i mean i meant to say the quotient rule you're not using that here you just need to differentiate the numerator of the fraction and the denominator of the fraction separately so what is the derivative of 4 raised to the 3x to find the derivative of a constant raised to a variable let's say a to the u it's equal to the same thing a to the u times the derivative of the exponent u prime times the natural log of the constant a so the derivative of 4 to the 3x is going to be 4 to the 3x times the derivative of 3x which is 3 times the natural log of 4. likewise the derivative of 3 to the 4x is going to be the same thing 3 to the 4x times the derivative of the exponent 4x which is 4 times the natural log of the base which is ln 3. and then the derivative of x is 1. now i need to rewrite my limit expression so we still have the limit as x approaches zero and now at this point we could use direct substitution because we're not going to get zero over zero anymore so replacing x with 0 we're going to have 4 raised to the 0 power times 3 times ln 4 minus 3 raised to the 0 power times 4 times ln 3 and divided by 1 is the same thing as the expression that we currently have so 4 to the 0 power is 1 leaving behind 3 ln 4 and 3 to the 0 power is 1. and so we get 4 ln 3. now let's get the decimal value of these expressions so 3 times the natural log of 4 that's 4.15883083 then 4 ln 3 that's 4.394449155 so subtracting those two numbers or simply just type in three l and four minus four l and three gives us this result negative point two three five five six six zero seven so this is i guess it's a rounded answer but this is the exact answer if you want to leave it in that form but that's how you can evaluate this exponential or this limit involving exponential expressions now let's make sure the work is correct so what we're going to do is we're going to substitute values into this expression so as x approaches 0 let's see what's going to happen let's plug in a small number like 0.1 4 raised to the 3 times point one minus three raised to the four times point one divided by point one so i got negative point three six one two nine now let's try another one let's try point zero zero one let's see what happens as x get very close to 1. so 4 raised to the 3 times 0.001 and then minus 3 raised to the 4 times that value divided by zero one so for this i got negative point two three six five seven which is close if you try an even closer number you're going to get a more accurate result so for this i got negative point two three five five seven six so as you can see as x gets closer and closer to zero it's going to approach this answer which means this answer is indeed correct now let's try one more example it's going to be similar to the previous example so let's say we have the limit as x approaches 0 of e to the x minus e raised to the negative x and this is going to be divided by x so for the sake of practice feel free to try this problem based on what we did in the last problem so let's begin using direct substitution we're gonna have e to the zero minus e to the negative zero which is still zero divided by zero so e to the zero is one and once again we're going to get zero over zero so we have an indeterminate type thus we need to use l'hopital's rule so let's take the derivative of the numerator and of the denominator so what is the derivative of e to the x so using this formula the derivative of a to the u is going to be a to the u times u prime times ln a so the derivative of e to the x e is a constant x is the variable it's going to be e c x times the derivative of x which is one times the natural log of e the natural log of e is equal to one so all of that is simply equal to e to the x the derivative of e to the negative x is going to be the same thing e to the negative x times the derivative of negative x which is negative 1 times ln e ln e is one so this just equals negative e to the negative x so the derivative of e to the x is the same thing e to the x minus the derivative of e to the negative x which is negative e to the negative x all divided by one now the two negative signs can be cancelled so we could change that to a positive sign and then at this point we could use direct substitution so it's e to the zero plus e to the zero or negative zero divided by one e to the 0 is 1. so we have 1 plus 1 divided by 1 which is 2 over 1. so the answer is 2. so that is the limit as x approaches 0 of e to the x minus e to the negative x over x now to confirm our answer let's plug in 0.1 for x let's see what we get using the original expression so e to the point one minus e to the negative point one divided by point one this is equal to two point zero zero three three three five which is very close to two so we don't have to try a smaller number like point zero one this is good enough but we can see that the answer is indeed two and so that's it for this video so now you know how to find the limit of exponential functions now for those of you who want other examples like more videos on limits let's say limits of inverse trig functions or rational functions or just other topics involving limits i'm going to post some videos i mean some links to those other videos in the description section below in this video so if you're interested in more problems feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance and that's it so thanks again for watching this video and don't forget to subscribe to this channel 

Transcript for: Limits of Trigonometric Functions
now let's work on some examples involving limits with trigonometric functions there are some equations that you need to know here's the first one the limit as x approaches 0 of sine x divided by x is equal to 1. so now let's confirm it a nice simple technique to evaluate any limit if you have access to a calculator is to plug in a number that's very close to what x is approaching to in this case it's approaching zero so let's try 0.1 make sure your calculator is in radian mode by the way sine of 0.1 divided by 0.1 that's equal to 0.998 which is very close to 1. now let's try point zero one let's see what's going to happen so this is going to be 0.99998 which is even closer to 1. so we know that this equation holds true now there's another formula that you need to know it's the limit as x approaches 0 1 minus cosine x divided by x this is equal to 0. so to confirm it let's plug in 0.1 let's see what number we're going to get if we do this so this is going to give you 0.05 approximately it rounds to 0.05 now let's try an even smaller number let's try 0.01 so this will give you 0.005 notice that these two numbers are not the same they look similar but this number is 10 times smaller it's getting closer and closer to zero just to confirm it let's try an even smaller number point zero zero one so this will be point zero zero zero so as we can see as x gets closer and closer to zero notice that y approaches zero as well so this equation holds true now let's work on this problem what is the limit as x approaches 0 of sine 5x divided by x what is that equal to now keep in mind we know that the limit as x approaches of sine x divided by x is one for those of you who quickly want to see the answer it's going to be five x divided by one x which is five but you gotta show your work though but that's just a quick way to get the answer for those of you who want that what you need to do is multiply the top and the bottom by five and we're going to take this five and move it over here so this is equal to the limit as x approaches zero sine five x divided by five x times five now we're going to do is we're going to use substitution let's say that y is equal to 5x so notice that the limit as x approaches 0 of 5x that's equal to zero that's also equivalent to the limit as y approaches zero of y since y is equal to five x as x approaches zero we know that this limit becomes zero and this is also equal to zero so therefore they're equal to each other so therefore as x approaches zero five x becomes zero and five x is y so y becomes zero two so i'm making that statement we need to realize that we can now change the limit to this expression we can say the limit as y approaches zero sine y divided by y times five so all we did is we substituted five x with y now we can use the formula if the limit as x approaches zero for sine x over x if that's one then the limit as y approaches zero of sine y divided by y must also be one so this is going to be one times five which is equal to five and that's the answer so what you wanna do is you want to make these two values the same and then you could replace it with a letter like y and then evaluate the limit that way let's try this problem what is the limit as x approaches 0 of sine 2x divided by 5x what do you think the answer to this problem is going to be it turns out that it's just 2 divided by 5. you can literally see it but now let's show our work so what we need to do is multiply the top and the bottom by two over two what i'm going to do is switch the two and the five so we can rewrite it as the limit as x approaches zero sine two x divided by two x times two over five so i just switched to places of these two numbers five times two and two times five they both equal ten so the value is still the same now once these two values are the same you can use substitution so we're going to let y equal to 2x so therefore we're going to change our expression as the limit as y approaches zero sine y divided by y times two over five now we can use that one identity where the limit as x approaches zero of sine x divided by x is one so this expression in blue is also equal to 1. so our final answer is 2 divided by 5 but now you can show your work this is how you're going to show your work if you have to take it on a test but if it's a multiple choice problem you can clearly see that it's 2 over 5. now what about this one what is the limit as x approaches 0 for sine 7x divided by sine 3x feel free to pause the video and work in this problem so just by looking at it we could see that it's seven divided by three but let's show our work so what we're going to do is we're going to multiply the top and the bottom by seven over seven three over three and x over x so now let's separate everything so i'm going to leave the sine 7x on top however i need to put seven and x i need to move this over here i want it to be below sine seven x now i need to do something with the sine 3x so i have to keep it on the bottom but on top i want 3x above it so i'm going to write it here now what i have left over is seven over three which i can put it in this third fraction so every number has been accounted for i just simply rearranged everything so let's say that y is equal to 7x and let's say another variable w let's let it equal to 3x so we're going to have the limit as y approaches 0 sine y over y so that's for this portion and then we're going to multiply that by the limit as w approaches zero of w divided by sine w since three x we set it equal to w and then we're gonna multiply everything by seven over three so therefore this becomes one this expression is also one and then times seven divided by three so the final answer is seven over three and that's it let's try this one the limit as x approaches 0 tangent x divided by x what do you think the answer to this problem is going to be well tangent we know is sine divided by cosine but first let's rewrite it like this let's separate x and tangent x and now in the next step let's replace tangent with side over cosine so this is equal to the limit as x approaches zero sine x divided by x i'm gonna switch these two multiplied by one over cosine x now as we apply the limit sine x over x based on the formula will change to one now what about cosine cosine of zero is one so as x approaches 0 this becomes 1 as well so the answer is 1. and you could see it tangent x and sine x are very similar 1x over 1x is 1. here's another example let's say if we want to find the limit as x approaches 0 of tan 4x divided by 3x the answer is going to be 4 over 3 but let's prove it so first let's convert tangent into sine over cosine so this is going to be sine four x divided by cosine four x times one over three x now we need to multiply the top and the bottom by four over four so we need to take x and four and move it under sign so this is equal to the limit as x approaches zero sine four x divided by four x times one over cosine four x times four over three we had a four on top and a three on the bottom now let's say that y is equal to four x so this becomes the limit as y approaches zero sine y divided by y times one over cosine y times four over three sine y over y will change into one cosine zero is one so the final answer is going to be four over three what about this one the limit as x approaches zero seven times one minus cosine x divided by x what's the answer now if you recall the limit as x approaches zero of one minus cosine x divided by x that's equal to zero so it's sure our work we're gonna separate seven from everything else so we know this portion here is zero so our answer is going to be seven times zero which is zero now let's try a different example what is the limit as x approaches zero sine squared x divided by x take a minute and try that problem so sine squared is basically sine x times sine x so we have sine x over x times x now let's separate this into two limits the limit as x approaches zero of sine x divided by x we know that's one the limit as x approaches zero of x well you can use direct substitution that's going to be zero so 1 times 0 is 0. so this is the final answer consider this one the limit as x approaches 0 sine of x squared divided by x what's the answer well what we need to do first is we need to multiply the top and bottom by x so we're going to get the limit as x approaches 0 sine of x squared divided by x squared so we combine these two together and then we have an x on top left over now let's use substitution let's set y equal to x squared but before we replace x squared of y let's write this expression using two limits so now on the left we say the limit as y approaches zero sine y divided by y times the limit as x approaches zero of the function x on the left sine y over y will change into one and the limit as x approaches zero of x is zero so the answer is zero 

Transcript for: Infinite Limits and Vertical Asymptotes
now let's talk about infinite limits what is the limit as x approaches zero of the function one over x what's the answer to that well first what we need to do is check the limit at the left side and the right side so let's start the left side what is one divided by negative point one one divided by negative point one is negative ten but now let's plug in a number that's even close to zero from the left side so it's going to be negative again let's try negative point zero one one divided by negative point zero one is negative a hundred and if we divide it by negative point zero zero one that becomes negative 1000 notice that the number gets larger and larger but with a negative sign so therefore we could say that this approaches negative infinity now what about the right sided limit what is the limit as x approaches zero from the right one over positive point one is ten one over point zero one is a hundred and one divided by point zero zero one is positive one thousand as you can see the number gets larger and larger so this is going to approach positive infinity now generally speaking whenever you have a small number basically zero from the right side whenever you have a small number in the denominator it makes the value of the fraction large so this is equivalent to positive infinity now keep in mind if it's exactly zero it's undefined so it really doesn't exist but if it's close to zero that means it's going to be very large so whenever you have one and zero from the left it's going to be negative infinity so just some things to keep in mind so now let's finish this question since these two limits do not match the left side and the right side therefore the limit as x approaches zero from either side does not exist now let's try another problem what is the limit as x approaches zero from either side of 1 divided by x squared so let's evaluate it as x approaches 0 from the left side so if we plug in 0 from the left we're still going to get a small number but it's going to be positive so you could treat it as 0 from the right and this is going to become positive infinity so for example let's say if we plug in negative point zero one negative point zero one squared is actually positive 0.0001 and 1 divided by that number is positive 10 000. you could type it in your calculator just to confirm it so that's why we got positive infinity now what about the limit as x approaches zero from the right so if we plug in zero from the right once we square it it's still going to be a positive number so it's still going to be small it's going to be very close to 0 but it's going to be positive and this is going to be positive infinity therefore the limit i mean excuse me the limit as x approaches 0 from the right from either side rather is going to be positive infinity the number is going to get larger and larger and larger so that's the answer as x approaches 0 from either side now let's move on to another example what is the limit as x approaches 2 from the left of 1 over x minus 2. go ahead and try that problem now let's use direct substitution let's plug in a number that's less than two less than two would be like one point nine one point nine minus two is negative point one and this is going to be negative 10. now if we try 1.99 on the bottom we're going to get negative 0.01 and that's going to be negative 100. so we can see that we're going to get a negative zero or zero from the left on the bottom so this is going to approach negative infinity and this is the answer for this one-sided limit what is the limit as x approaches three from the right of five divided by x minus three let's go ahead and evaluate this one so three from the right we can plug in 3.1 3.1 minus 3 is 0.1 5 divided by 0.1 is 50. so notice that we have a very large positive value so therefore the limit as x approaches 3 from the right of 5 divided by x minus 3 this is going to be positive infinity anytime you get a 0 on the bottom it's either going to be plus or minus infinity in this case since we have a 0 from the right it's positive infinity now what about the limit as x approaches negative 4 from the left of 15 divided by x plus four try that so let's plug in a number that's close to negative four from the left so here's negative four to the left of it is negative 5. so we want to plug in a number like negative 4.1 negative 4.1 plus 4 that's negative 0.1 and 150 divided by negative 0.1 is negative 150. so we get a very large negative value so we could say that this limit approaches negative infinity what about the limit as x approaches 2 from the right let's say this is x minus 2 with a negative 8 on top what's the answer so negative 8 divided by two from the right minus two this is going to give us a zero from the right so having zero from the right that's gonna be like negative or positive infinity so it's like negative eight times positive infinity which in the end will be negative infinity but let's actually plug in a number to confirm it so 2 to the right let's plug in a number that's bigger than 2 so 2.1 could be a good example 2.1 minus 2 is positive 0.1 negative 8 divided by positive 0.1 is negative 80. so we have a very large negative number which means the limit approaches negative infinity now what about this one what is the limit as x approaches one from either side of one divided by x minus one so let's evaluate it from the left side first so as x approaches 1 from the left what is it going to be well we can approximate it by plugging a number that's less than one let's try 0.9 0.9 minus 1 that's negative 0.1 so this is negative 10. so we know that this is going to be equal to a large negative number so we can say that the limit as x approaches 1 from the left is going to be negative infinity now let's check the right side as x approaches 1 from the right so we can approximate it using 1.1 so this is going to be positive 0.1 1 divided by positive 0.1 is positive 10. so therefore this limit is going to approach positive infinity now these two limits do not match so this limit does not exist here's another one that you can try the limit as x approaches 2 from the right of x cubed divided by x minus 2 raised to the second power try that so we can plug in 2 on top on the bottom we need to plug in 2.1 we have to plug in a number that's close to 2 but to the right of 2. 2.1 minus 2 that's going to be like 0.1 0.1 squared that's 0.01 so what we need to take from this is we're going to get a very large positive number so therefore this is going to approach positive infinity let's say if you plug in 2.01 instead 2.01 to the 3rd power that's about 8.12 and if you divide it by 2.01 minus 2 squared this is going to be a very large positive number so in the end we can see that this is going to approach positive infinity now what about the limit as x approaches 3 from either side of this function well if we plug in 3 this is we're going to have a 0 in the bottom so we know it's either going to be positive infinity or negative infinity so we just got to check the sign so let's start with the right side on the right side we need to plug in a number that's bigger than three three point one minus three is a positive number and point one squared is point zero one one divided by point zero one is a hundred times eight that's going to be positive eight hundred so on the right side it approaches positive infinity on the left side if we plug in a number that's let's say less than three like two point nine two point nine minus one i mean two point nine minus three is a negative 0.1 but when you square a negative 0.1 you're going to get positive 0.01 so you're going to get the same value positive 800. so therefore these two limits they match so the limit as x approaches 3 from either side approaches positive infinity due to the square everything is going to be positive what is the limit as x approaches negative 3 from the left given this expression x plus 3 divided by x squared plus x minus 6. in this example the first thing we need to do is factor what two numbers multiply to negative six but add to the middle coefficient of one this is going to be positive three and negative two so x squared plus x minus six is equivalent to x plus 3 and x minus 2. now if we plug in negative 3 now negative 3 plus 3 will give us a 0 on the bottom but because it cancels we can use direct substitution in this problem so all we got to do is replace x with negative three so it's gonna be negative three minus two which is negative five so the answer is one divided by negative five here's another one what is the limit as x approaches five from either side of x squared divided by x squared plus 25 go ahead and work on this problem now if we plug in five we won't get a zero on the bottom so in this example we can use direct substitution five squared or five times five is twenty five twenty five plus twenty five is fifty and twenty five divided by fifty is one half so this is the answer now what is the limit as x approaches 0 from the left of the expression 2 minus 1 divided by x so go ahead and try that so let's start with this term what's the limit as x approaches 0 from the left of positive 1 over x we know that 0 from the left this is going to be negative infinity so if we have negative 1 over x this will change to positive infinity so this becomes 2 plus positive infinity which in the end will be positive infinity and let's try plugging in a small number let's try plugging in negative point zero one one divided by negative 0.01 that's going to be negative 100 so 2 minus negative 100 that's going to be 102. so we have a very large positive number which tells us that this limit is going to approach positive infinity now what about the limit as x approaches zero from the right of the natural log function l and x what is the answer it helps to know the graph of l and x ln one is zero by the way it has the vertical asymptote at zero so it looks like this so as you approach zero which is the y axis from the right notice that it goes down to negative infinity and if you have a calculator you can confirm it let's say if you plug in ln 0.1 this is equal to negative 2.3 now let's plug in ln point zero zero zero one so it has to be from the right side so it has to be positive this is going to equal negative nine point two so notice that we get a larger negative let's plug in a very very small number one times ten to negative fifty so that's like point zero zero zero zero zero almost fifty times and then a one is negative 115. so slowly becomes more negative as we can see so that's why it approaches negative infinity now what about the limit as x approaches zero from the left of ln x notice that there's nothing on the left side so therefore this limit does not exist if you were to type in ln negative 0.1 in your calculator you're going to get a math error that means that it doesn't exist you can't have a negative number inside a natural log so therefore the limit as x approaches 0 from either side of ln x also does not exist because the left side does not exist but the right side it approaches negative infinity now what is the limit as x approaches zero of tangent x let's go over some trigonometric functions now for this we can use direct substitution tangent of zero is 0. now let's say if we change it what if x approached pi over 2 and we still have the tangent function what's the answer now tangent pi over 2 is undefined so we can't just use direct substitution so therefore we need to check the left and the right side so let's start with the right side of tangent so let's approach pi over 2 from the right pi over 2 is basically equivalent to 90 degrees so if you want to plug in a number that's close to 90 from the right side we need to try 90.1 now feel free to put your calculator in degree mode tangent 90.1 is about negative 573 if you round it to nearest whole number tan 90.01 is negative seven hundred and thirty so therefore we can see that it's approaching negative infinity it's becoming more negative as we get closer to 90. and it makes sense because 90.1 is located in quadrant two and tangent is negative in quadrant two the limit as x approaches pi over 2 from the left now let's say if we plug in 89.9 tangent 89.9 is positive 573. so we can see that this is going to approach positive infinity so these two limits they they don't match they're different so therefore the limit as x approaches pi over 2 of tangent x does not exist so anytime you see tangent just keep in mind that you can replace it with sine divided by cosine and notice that if you plug in pi over two sine pi over two is equal to one and cosine pi over two is zero anytime you get a zero on the bottom it's undefined so that's a clue that you need to check the left side and the right side of limits as well so that limit does not exist now what about this one what is the limit as x approaches 0 from the right of cosecant x now keep in mind cosecant is one over sine and sine of zero is zero one over zero is undefined but since we're approaching zero chances are our answer is going to be positive or negative infinity so let's find out which one now we'll plug in a number that's greater than zero since it's to the right of zero sine of point one is going to be approximately 0.1 if this is in radian mode sine of 0.1 is about 0.0998 which let's round that to 0.1 and 1 over 0.1 is 10. now if we plug in sine of point zero zero one this answer is going to be approximately about a hundred so therefore the numbers are getting bigger and bigger as we approach zero so we can make the conclusion that the limit as x approaches zero from the right of cosecant is positive infinity now what about the limit as x approaches pi over two of secant x let's try that so secant is one over cosine and if we plug in pi over two cosine pi over two is zero so it's undefined so as we approach pi over two if we analyze the left and right side limits it's either going to be positive infinity or negative infinity so let's start with the right side so cosine of 90.1 is that a positive value or negative value 90.1 is in quadrant two and cosine is negative so therefore we can make the conclusion that this is going to be negative infinity if you plug in one make sure your calculator is in radian mode or rather degree mode if you plug in one divided by cosine 90.1 you're going to get negative 573. now on the left side of pi over two that's 89.9 the angle is in quadrant one cosine is positive in quadrant one so we could say this is going to approach positive infinity so since these do not match we could say that the limit as x approaches pi over 2 from either side does not exist now here's the last question related to this section what is the limit as x approaches positive 4 from the right of 1 divided by the square root of x minus 2. so if we plug in 4 the square root of 4 is 2 2 minus 2 is 0 1 over 0 is undefined but since it approaches 4 and it doesn't equal 4 it's either going to be positive or negative infinity so let's substitute x with 4.1 the square root of 4.1 is going to be a number that's just above 2. so let's make a number let's say 2.1 let's say if we don't have access to a calculator it's probably going to be less than 2.1 1 divided by 0.1 is 10. so this is a relatively large positive number the actual value of the square root of 4.1 is 2.02 5. and this is actually 40. so this is definitely a bad estimate but this will lead us to the same final answer and that is since we're getting a large positive number we could say that the limit approaches positive infinity and that is the answer to the question so a lot of these problems you can use direct substitution to get the answer just make sure you plug in a number that's close to the value that x is approaching and it's always going to work if you do it that way now let's talk about how to find the vertical asymptote of a function so let's say if we have the function one over x plus two what is the vertical asymptote to find it set the denominator equal to zero so the vertical asymptote is going to be x is equal to negative two so let's try some more examples what is the vertical asymptote in this case so if we set x minus three equal to zero the vertical asymptote is x equals three here's another example let's say if the function is x minus five divided by x minus five over x plus three and if we have another one let's say seven x plus one over x minus two x plus one what are the vertical asymptotes so looking at the factor in the bottom x plus one we just need to change the sign so the vertical asymptote is going to be x equals negative one and for the factor x minus two the vertical asymptotes can be x equals plus two simply reverse the sign now for the next one for the factor x plus 3 is going to be x is equal to negative 3. x minus 5 will not lead to a vertical asymptote because it can be cancelled so x equals 5 is a whole everything else are vertical asymptotes what about this one 1 divided by x squared minus four what are the vertical asymptotes found in this rational function so what we need to do is factor using the difference of perfect squares technique the square root of x squared is x and the square root of four is two and so it's going to be x plus two and x minus two so we can see that the vertical asymptotes are x equals negative two and x equals positive two so sometimes you need to factor in order to find it here's another example in which you need to factor so how can we factor x squared minus x minus two what two numbers multiply to negative two but add up to negative one this is going to be negative two and one so to factor it it's simply x minus two and x plus one so therefore the vertical asymptotes are x is equal to positive 2 and negative 1. now for the sake of practice let's try one more example try this one so take a minute pause the video and work on it so we need to factor everything completely in the numerator we could take out an x which will leave behind x minus two in a denominator we can factor using the difference of perfect squares the square root of x to the fourth is x squared and the square root of 16 is four now we can't factor x squared plus four without using imaginary numbers but we can factor x squared minus four because we did it in the last example and we know it's x plus two times x minus two so this factor leads to a whole so we have a hole at x equals positive two this one leads to the vertical asymptote which is x equals negative two now let's talk about the other factor that was in the denominator and that is x squared plus four notice that there's no vertical asymptotes or holes associated with this if we set it equal to zero we need to subtract both sides by four and so x squared is going to equal negative 4 and if we take the square root of both sides we're not going to get a real number keep in mind the square root of negative 1 is i so this is going to be plus or minus the square root of 4 is 2 times the square root of negative 1 which is i so you get positive 2i and negative 2i these are not real numbers they're imaginary numbers so they don't represent any holes or vertical asymptotes so that's why we could ignore x squared plus 4. 

Transcript for: How To Find The Limit At Infinity
in this lesson we're going to talk about how to find a limit at infinity so what is the limit as x approaches infinity for the function x squared so if x became very large what would x squared become so let's say if x was a thousand x squared would turn into a larger value it's going to be one million so as x gets very large this turns into infinity as well it becomes even larger which a large number is still infinity now what about the limit as x approaches negative infinity of x squared well if we replace x with negative infinity when you square a negative number it's going to be a positive number so any n is going to be positive infinity if you square a negative thousand a negative a thousand times a negative thousand is positive one million so you still get a very large positive number now what about the limit as x approaches infinity for positive x cubed infinity to the third power is still going to be a large positive number so that's going to be positive infinity and as x approaches negative infinity because it's raised to the third power it's going to be negative so your final answer is negative infinity now let's look at some other examples what is the limit as x approaches negative infinity of this expression 5 plus 2x minus x cubed now if you're given a polynomial function you could ignore the insignificant terms 5 and 2x are insignificant compared to negative x cubed so this expression is equivalent to the limit as x approaches negative infinity of negative x cubed when x becomes very large the other terms are in significant 5 and 2x for example let's say if x is negative a thousand two x is negative two thousand but negative x cubed that's going to be positive one billion which is a lot larger than two thousand so we have negative and then negative infinity to the third power negative infinity to the third power is just negative infinity and then negative times negative infinity will give you a final answer of positive infinity and so that's going to be the answer for that problem here's another one you could try what is the limit as x approaches negative infinity of 3 x cubed minus 5 x to the fourth now 3x cube is insignificant compared to 5x to the fourth this has a higher degree so this expression is equivalent to the limit as x approaches negative infinity of negative five x to the fourth and so that's going to be negative five times negative infinity to the fourth power to the fourth power any negative number will become positive and negative five times positive infinity is going to be a very large negative number so we're going to say that's negative infinity and so that's the answer now you need to know how to find the limit at infinity given a rational function so what is the limit as x approaches infinity for one over x now you need to know what happens to the value of a fraction whenever the denominator increases in value so for example let's say if x is 0.1 actually no a large number let's say like 10. 1 divided by 10 is 0.1 now if we increase the value of the denominator to 100 notice that the value of the fraction will become even smaller one divided by 100 is point zero one and one divided by a thousand is point zero zero one notice that as x gets larger and larger the value of the whole fraction gets smaller and smaller in fact it is approaching zero so we could say that the limit as x approaches infinity of one over x is zero in fact the limit as x approaches any large number for any rational function or a function where it's bottom heavy where the degree of the denominator exceeds that of the numerator will always be zero so let's say if we have the limit as x approaches infinity of five x plus two over seven x minus x squared the degree of the denominator is two the degree of the numerator is one so we have a bottom heavy function anytime it's bottom heavy and if you have in a limit at infinity it's going to equal zero now if you want to show your work here's what you can do multiply the top and the bottom by 1 over x squared so what we're going to have is the limit as x approaches infinity 5 divided by x plus 2 over x squared and then this is going to be 7 over x minus 1. so this expression turns into a zero because it's bottom heavy same is true for this one that's going to be zero and so zero divided by negative one is zero so the limit approaches zero now here's another example let's say if we have the limit as x approaches infinity of eight x squared minus five x over 4x squared plus 7. so what's the answer notice that in this example the degree of the numerator is the same as that of the denominator when you see that you could simply divide the coefficients so it's going to be 8 divided by 4 which is equal to 2. and so that's the answer for this limit but if you need to show your work we're going to do is multiply the top and the bottom by 1 over x squared and so we're going to have the limit as x approaches infinity of 8 minus 5 over x divided by 4 plus seven over x squared now the limit as x approaches infinity for five over x that's going to become zero and for seven over x squared that's gonna be zero as well because it's bottom heavy and so we're gonna have eight divided by four which will give us the answer of two so that's what you can do if you have uh a rational function with the same degree on top and on the bottom so based on that example go ahead and try this one what is the limit as x approaches negative infinity of 5x minus 7x cubed over 2x squared plus 14x cubed minus 9. so looking at this the degree of the top and the bottom is three so the answer is going to be negative seven divided by positive fourteen which is negative one half but now let's show the work so because the highest degree is three i'm going to multiply this hop in the bottom by one over x cubed so we're going to have is the limit as x approaches negative infinity this is going to become 5 over x squared minus 7 divided by 2 over x plus 14 minus 9 over x cubed so here we have a rational function that's bottom heavy that's gonna turn into a zero the constant will remain the same this is bottom heavy two so that's gonna be another zero so it's gonna be zero plus fourteen and that's bottom heavy so that's going to be zero so we're gonna get negative seven divided by fourteen and fourteen you can write it as seven times two at which point you can cancel a seven so the final answer is negative one over two and so that's how you can calculate the limit of that expression now what about a rational function that's top heavy let's say this is 5x plus 6x squared divided by 3x minus 8. so what do you do in this case what i like to do if you want to do it mentally a simple way is to remove the insignificant terms in the numerator the insignificant term is 5x 6x squared has much more weight than 5x on the bottom 3x is more significant than negative 8. so this expression is equivalent to the limit as x approaches infinity of positive 6x squared divided by 3x and then that reduces to 2x so this is going to be 2 times infinity so your final answer should be positive infinity but now let's do this problem another way so just like we've been doing before let's multiply the top and the bottom by one over x since the highest degree on the bottom is one on top it's two but they're not the same so i'm going to go with one this time so on top it's going to be 5 plus 6x and on the bottom 3 minus 8 over x so this is a bottom heavy function when x becomes large it's going to turn to zero and here we can replace this with infinity so six times infinity is simply infinity and five plus infinity is still a large number infinity if you divide infinity by three you're still going to have a large number so any n the final answer is just infinity so let's do one more example just in case you found the last example a bit confusing so this is going to be 5 plus 2x minus 3x cubed over four x squared plus nine x minus seven so once again we have a function that's top heavy now what i like to do personally my way of quickly getting the answer is to eliminate every term that's insignificant in the numerator the most significant term is the 3x cube so we can ignore the 5 and the 2x in the denominator keep the most significant term which is 4x squared so we're going to be left we can get rid of the 9x and the 7. so this simplifies to negative x cubed over four x squared which you can reduce that to negative three x over four and so the answer is going to be negative three three-fourths times negative infinity which becomes positive infinity and you could check it if you plug in let's say negative 1000 into this equation you should get a very large positive number you 

Transcript for: Limits of Inverse Trigonometric Functions | Calculus
consider this problem what is the limit as x approaches infinity of the function that is the inverse tangent of x how can we find the answer it helps to know what the graph of inverse tan or arc tangent of x looks like there's two horizontal asymptotes the first one is y equals pi over two and the second horizontal asymptote is y equals negative pi over two and the graph of arc tangent of x looks like this it stays in between these two asymptotes so knowing that as x approaches positive infinity this is the x-axis this is the y so as x increases we just follow the graph as it goes to the right notice that the y value approaches pi over two and this is the answer the limit as x approaches infinity of arc tangent of x is equal to pi over two now let's say if we want to find the limit as x approaches negative infinity of the same function our tangent of x well in this case negative infinity lies towards the left positive infinity is on the right side so we need to follow the curve all the way to the left and notice that it approaches negative pi over two this graph will continue to travel horizontally staying within the lower horizontal asymptote so the answer is negative pi over two and it's very easy to evaluate a limit if you know the graph of a function so when evaluating limits of inverse trigonometric functions it's very very helpful if you can if you memorize the shape of the graphs or if you have access to them now let's try another example what is the limit as x approaches two of arc tangent of x and this is going to be let's see one divided by x minus two in this problem we can't use direct substitution because we're going to have our tangent of one over two minus two and getting a 0 in the denominator of a fraction will make it undefined so direct substitution is not going to work in this example now when x approaches 2 what's going to happen the expression 1 over x minus 2 can go to infinity but we need to be careful with this one we need to break it up into one sided limits let's start with when x approaches 2 from the left side so imagine if x was 1.999 if you type in 1 divided by 1.999 minus 2 this will give you negative 1 000 so you get a very large negative number this tells us that the limit approaches well this expression 1 over x minus 2 approaches negative infinity so we have the limit as well rather let me take that back we have our tangent of negative infinity and we know that our tangent of a negative infinity value that's going to give us negative pi over 2 based on this limit now we need to check not just the left-sided limit but the right-sided limit as well so that is when x approaches 2 from the right side of arc tangent 1 over x minus 2. so from the right side if we were to plug in two point zero zero one one over two point zero zero one minus two make sure to put those last two numbers in parenthesis this will give you positive a thousand which indicates that one over x minus two approaches positive infinity and what you could do is you can graph the rational function so we have a vertical asymptote at x equals 2. now this rational function is bottom heavy meaning that the degree of the denominator is higher than the degree of the numerator so therefore we have another horizontal asymptote which is y equals zero any time you have a rational function as bottom heavy now if we plug in 3 we would get 1. so let's say this is a y value of 1 and if we were to plug in 1 1 over x minus two will be negative one so this indicates that the shape of the graph looks something like this so it's bounded by the vertical and the horizontal asymptotes so as x approaches 2 from the left side we can see that it's going towards a y value of negative infinity which is what we get here and as x approaches 2 this is the vertical asymptote x equals 2. from the right side notice that it goes up towards positive infinity because plug-in 2.001 gave us a large positive answer and we see the graph agrees with that so as x approaches 2 from the right the expression 1 over x minus 2 approaches positive infinity so we have our tangent of positive infinity or if you want to you can write it this way you can now say this is equal to the limit as x approaches positive infinity of arc tangent of x and we know that's going to equal posit positive rather pi over 2 based on this answer now notice that the left sided limit and the right side of the limit are not the same because they're different the original limit does not exist and so that is the answer for this problem the limit doesn't exist now let's work on another example what is the limit as x approaches infinity of arc cosine one over x go ahead and try that so let's begin with the graph of one over x the graph of one over x looks like this it has a vertical asymptote at x equals zero which is here and a horizontal asymptote of y equals zero which is here because it's bottom heavy so if we follow the curve as x increases towards positive infinity this curve approaches a y value of zero so the limit as x approaches infinity for the expression one over x becomes zero so this is equal to arc cosine of zero now what is the arc cosine of zero well we could start with the graph of arc cosine of x arc cosine of x has a limited domain the domain varies from negative 1 to positive one and a range is from zero to pi so i'm going to extend this so let's say this is pi over two and this is pi now hopefully you remember your trigonometric values cosine of zero is one so in this case when x is one the y value will be zero cosine of pi over two is equal to zero so when x is zero y will be pi over two and then cosine of pi is equal to negative one so when x is negative one y will be equal to pi and so the graph looks something like that so what is arc cosine of zero all you need to do is basically reverse that equation if cosine pi over 2 is 0 r cosine of 0 is pi over 2. so here's 0 0 is basically the y axis that's when x is zero as we approach zero from the left you can see the y value approaches pi over two as we approach zero from the right the y value approaches pi over two so the left sided and the right side limits are the same so that's r cosine of 0 is just going to be pi over 2. so that's the answer for that particular problem let's work on one more example let's say we have the limit as x approaches positive infinity of the expression arc sine 5 plus 2 x cubed divided by four x cubed minus eight go ahead and try when we're dealing with limits at infinity what we can do with the rational function is we can multiply the top and the bottom by 1 over x cubed and so if we do that we're going to have the limit as x approaches infinity of arcsin and then we're going to have 5 over x cubed plus 2 divided by 4 minus 8 over x cubed now the limit as x approaches infinity for 1 over x cubed times some constant that's gonna be zero because it's bottom heavy a constant divided by a thousand raised to the third power will be approximately zero so this will become zero that will become zero so what we're going to have is the arc sine of two over four which is equal to the arc sine of one half now sine of what angle is equal to one half keep in mind sine has a limited domain and range i mean arc sine the domain for arc sine is negative i mean yeah negative one to one and the range is negative pi over two to pi over two now sine on the other hand has an unlimited domain negative infinity to infinity and the range is negative one to one that's sine but for arc sine it has a limited domain so you need to pick an answer between quadrant one and quadrant four so sine of what angle is one half this is sine pi over six so therefore the arc sine of one half is gonna equal pi over six you simply need to swap these two so this is the answer to the problem here is the graph of arc sine it has a domain from negative one to one and a range from negative pi over two to pi over two so it only exists in quadrants three and four of the unit circle sine of pi over two is one sine of negative pi over two is negative one and sine of zero is zero and the graph looks something like this so pi over six will be somewhere in this region which is my graph is not perfect but it's supposed to be around a half so as you approach pi over six you get a value of one half or as you approach one half on the x-axis the y-value is pi over six now one thing you need to be careful with is that sine five pi over six is one half but you wouldn't say the arc sine of one half is five pi over six because five pi over six is not in the range of arc sine so just be careful with that so the answer for this problem is just pi over six so that's it for this video so now you know how to solve uh limits dealing with inverse trigonometric functions thanks again for watching

consider this problem what is the limit as x goes to infinity of the x root of x feel free to try this problem so what would you recommend is our first step here what's the first thing we need to do in order to solve this problem what i recommend doing is setting the original expression equal to y so we have y is equal to the limit as x goes to infinity of x root of x now the next thing that we could do is change the radical into a fractional exponent this is x to the first power and so we can write this as this is equal to the limit as x goes to infinity of x raised to the 1 over x so now what do you think we should do whenever you have a variable raised to another variable in order to bring this exponent down you need to use logarithms we're going to use the natural log so let's take the natural log of both sides so we're going to have the natural log of y is equal to the limit as x goes to infinity of the natural log of x raised to the 1 over x and for instance ln x to the fourth power is equal to 4 times ln x that's just one of the properties of logs you could take the exponent and move it to the front so we're going to do the same thing here we're going to take 1 over x and move it to the front and so we're going to have ln y is equal to the limit as x goes to infinity 1 over x times ln x and we can write that as the natural log of x divided by x now if we were to use direct substitution at this point we would get the natural log of infinity over infinity which is infinity divided by infinity and infinity divided by infinity you really don't know what that is that could be infinity it could be zero it could be five it's indeterminate so whenever you have an indeterminate type like this one or zero over zero you can evaluate the limit using l'hopital's rule which is what we're going to do since direct substitution didn't work at this point and in order to use lobital's rule we need to take the derivative of the top and the bottom part of the fraction so we have ln y is equal to the limit as x goes to infinity and the derivative of ln x is one over x the derivative of x is one one over x divided by one is just one over x so now at this point we could use direct substitution the limit as x goes to infinity of one over x is zero one divided by a very large number is going to give us a very small number so one of infinity is virtually zero so we have ln y is equal to zero now whenever you have a log expression let's say log base a of b is equal to c you can convert it into an exponential expression a raised to the c power is equal to b now the base of a natural log is always e so we could say e to the zero power is equal to y and anything raised to let me say that again anything raised to the zero power is one so our answer is one so y is equal to our original expression the limit as x goes to infinity of the x root of x all of that is equal to one and so that is our answer now let's confirm the answer with the use of a table so let's say if x is 10 we're going to have the tenth root of 10 or 10 to the 1 over 10. if we plug that into our calculator 10 raised to the 1 over 10 it's going to give us 1.2589 let's see what happens when x gets larger let's try 100 so 100 raised to the 1 over 100 that's going to be 1.04713 so notice how the numbers are getting smaller if we try a thousand this is going to be one point zero zero six nine three and let's try one more ten thousand so ten thousand raised to the one over ten thousand and that's going to be 1.000921 so we can see that as x gets larger and larger that is as it goes to infinity that expression the x root of x approaches one and so that is the answer to this problem 

Transcript for: Limits at Infinity & Horizontal Asymptotes
let's talk about limits at infinity what is the limit as x approaches infinity of 1 over x what's the answer well let's start plugging in large numbers whenever the denominator is large you're going to get a small value if the denominator has a small value you get a large value so for example 1 divided by 10 is 0.1 1 divided by 100 is one and one divided by a thousand is point zero zero one therefore we could say that one over infinity which is a very very large number is going to be about zero so the limit as x approaches infinity of one over x is therefore equal to zero now what about the limit as x approaches negative infinity of one over x one divided by negative infinity will still be zero if you divide the one by negative point one i mean by negative ten rather this would be negative point one if you divide one by negative a hundred you get negative point zero zero one i mean negative point zero one and if you divide it by negative a thousand you get negative point zero zero one it's still approaching zero just from the left side so this is zero from the right side this is equal to zero from the left side which you could just say it's equal to zero now let's graph this function the graph of one over x looks like this it has a vertical asymptote at x equals zero and it has a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero so as you can see as x approaches positive infinity you're going to get the horizontal asymptote which is y is equal to zero as we follow the curve all the way to the right it's going to get closer and closer to zero this will also give you the horizontal asymptote on the left side which is also y equals zero to get the vertical asymptote as x approaches zero from the right side this will give us positive infinity so that tells you that zero is a vertical asymptote if you approach zero from the left side you're going to get negative infinity it's going down so the x value that leads to a y value of infinity that's going to be the vertical asymptote when x approaches infinity the y value corresponds to the horizontal asymptote let's try another problem what is the limit as x approaches infinity of 1 over x squared well here we have another bottom heavy function and if we plug in a large number let's say like a hundred one hundred squared is ten thousand and one divided by ten thousand is still a very small number point zero zero zero one so we can say this is going to approach 0. anytime you have 1 divided by infinity it's always going to equal 0. so here's the general theorem the limit as x approaches infinity of some function 1 over x to the r will always be equal to 0. so that's something that you may want to keep in mind what is the limit as x approaches infinity of eight divided by three x plus four so what process can we use to figure this out what we need to do is multiply the top and the bottom by one over x and so this is going to be equal to 8 divided by x and then on the bottom we're going to distribute 3x times 1 over x is 3 and 4 times 1 over x is 4 over x so now we can apply the limit as x approaches infinity for every term in this fraction so recall anytime you have let's say a fraction like 1 over x that's going to turn into zero the limit as x approaches infinity for one over x is zero so we can rewrite this as the limit well this is going to be let's separate the 8 from 1 over x so it's 8 times the limit as x approaches infinity 1 over x over 3 plus 4 times the limit as x approaches infinity 1 over x if you want to show every step so we know this portion is equal to 0 and the same is true for this part so it's going to be 8 times 0 divided by three plus four times zero so this is zero over three plus zero which is zero over three basically the whole thing is zero so anytime the function is bottom heavy notice that the degree of the denominator is greater than that of the numerator anytime it's bottom heavy it's going to equal zero now let's work on something else what is the limit as x approaches infinity of 8x minus 5 divided by 2x plus 3. so what is the answer in this case now notice that the degree of the numerator is the same as that of the denominator they're both to the first power so they're in the first degree whenever the degree of the numerator and the denominator is the same you can simply divide the coefficients so 8 divided by 2 is 4. therefore this is going to equal 4. now let's prove it let's show our work so i'm going to multiply the top and the bottom by 1 over x so therefore this is going to be the limit as x approaches infinity 8x times 1 over x is simply 8 and then we're going to have 5 times 1 over x which is 5 over x and then this is going to be 2 plus 3 over x the limit as x approaches infinity of 5 over x is going to equal 0. if you want to write it out separately you can write it out as 5 times the limit as x approaches infinity of one over x so that's five times zero which in the end is going to be zero now three over x that's also going to change into zero so eight divided by two is four so keep in mind for those of you who want to write out every step you can write it like this if you want to and then you can apply the formula since this is a rational function it's going to equal zero but in the end you're going to get the same answer positive four what is the limit as x approaches infinity of five minus seven x cubed divided by three x plus five x cubed plus nine go ahead and try this problem so notice that the degree of the numerator is three and the degree of the denominator is three that's the highest exponent on top and on the bottom so you could say that as x becomes large five is insignificant to seven x cubed because if you plug in a thousand into x a thousand to the third is a billion times seven that's seven billion five is insignificant to that so three x and nine are insignificant to five x cubed so this is approximately equal to uh negative seven x cubed divided by five x cubed which the answer turns out to be negative seven over five but let's confirm it so what we need to do is multiply the top and the bottom this time by one over x cubed since the highest degree is x cubed or 3. so this is going to be the limit as x approaches infinity 5 over x cubed minus 7 divided by 3 over x squared plus five plus nine over x cubed five divided by infinity to the third power is going to be zero anytime you have infinity in the bottom of a fraction it's zero so we're gonna have zero minus seven three over infinity squared that's going to be zero plus five plus nine over infinity cubed which is zero so in the end you get negative seven divided by five what is the limit as x approaches infinity of the square root of 16 x squared minus 8 divided by 2 x minus 5. go ahead and try it so when x is very large only the most significant term will remain or will be important 8 is insignificant and 5 is insignificant so this expression becomes equal to the square root of 16x squared divided by 2x the square root of 16 is 4 and the square root of x squared is x and 4x divided by 2x is 2. so that's going to be the answer but now let's confirm it with a step-by-step process so we're going to multiply the top and the bottom by 1 over x so on the bottom 2x times 1 over x is simply 2 and then we're going to have 5 over x now how do we put the 1 over x inside a square root so let's say if you have x root 2 and you want to move the x into the square root you need to multiply the exponent by 2. so it's going to turn into 2x squared because the square root of x squared is x so if you want to move it back in you need to double the exponent so to move in 1 over x into the radical we need to multiply the inside by 1 over x squared 16x squared times 1 over x squared that's going to be just 16. and then we're going to have 8 over x squared divided by 2 minus 5 over x so now let's apply the limit as x approaches infinity to every term it's not going to affect the 16 because that's a constant 8 over x squared that's going to turn into 0 and 5 over x that's going to be zero as well the square root of 16 is four so four divided by two is two and that's going to be the answer now let's try this one what is the limit as x approaches infinity of the square root of nine x to the sixth minus x squared divided by three x to the third plus one so we know that these terms are insignificant so this becomes equal to the square root of nine x to the sixth over three x cubed the square root of nine is three the square root of x to the sixth is three x to the third so these two cancel the final answer is one now to show your work we can multiply the top and the bottom by one over x cubed so this becomes the limit as x approaches infinity and then on the inside we're going to have 1 over x cubed actually x to the 6 now the exponent will double once we move it to the inside so 1 over x to the 6 times 9 x to the 6 minus x squared divided by 3 plus 1 divided by x cubed so now what we're going to do is rewrite this expression so this is going to be equal to the square root of 9 plus the limit as x approaches infinity and that's going to be negative 1 over x to the fourth that's negative x squared divided by x to the sixth and then on the bottom we're gonna have three plus the limit as x approaches infinity one over x cubed so this is going to become the square root of nine and the limit as x approaches infinity for one over x to the fourth that's going to be zero and for one over x cubed that's going to be zero and then the square root of nine is three so three divided by three is one what is the limit as x approaches infinity of this function the square root of nine x squared plus x minus three x what do we need to do here what should we do well if you're not sure what to do use direct substitution plug in a very large number into the function so let's use a thousand so nine times a thousand squared plus a thousand minus three times a thousand now if you type this whole thing in you should get point one six six six six two zero three seven three which is basically one over six which is point one six repeating so one over six is the exact answer but now what techniques can we use to actually get that answer the first thing you should do is write this as a fraction put it over one and then multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate that is nine x squared plus x plus three x so when we foil the binomials on top the two middle terms will cancel so what we're going to have is the limit as x approaches infinity of 9x squared plus x the square roots cancel and then 3x times 3x is 9x squared but that's going to be negative 9x squared divided by what we have here these two add up to nine so we can get rid of it so based on what remains we're going to multiply the top and the bottom by one over x so this is going to be the limit as x approaches infinity x times one over x is one now inside the radical we need to multiply it by one over x squared nine x squared times one over x squared is going to be nine x times one over x squared is going to be one over x and three x times one over x is just three so now all we do all we need to do excuse me is apply the limit so one over x the limit as x approaches infinity of one over x is zero so this is going to be one divided by the square root of nine plus zero plus three and we know the square root of nine is three and 3 plus 3 is 6. so the final answer as you mentioned before is 1 over 6. what is the limit as x approaches infinity of the function arc tangent of x so what is the arc tan of infinity well let's plug in points so first put your calculator in degree mode so if we plug in arc tan of a hundred this is 89.4 now if we plug in arc tan of a thousand this is 89.94 notice that it gets closer and closer to 90. so this is equal to 90 degrees or in radians pi over 2. if we recall the limit as tangent or as x approaches pi over 2 from the left side of tangent x that's equal to infinity so when dealing with inverse tangent you need to switch these two values now what is the limit as x approaches negative infinity of the arctangent function so if we plug in arc tan of negative 1000 while it's in degree mode this is going to be negative 89.9 so this is negative pi over 2 or basically negative 90. tangent is negative in quadrants two and four but arctan only exists in quadrants one and four so that's why we got the answer that's in quadrant four negative 89.9 which gets it very close to negative 90 or negative pi over 2. so make sure you know these values now there's one more that we need to go over what is the limit as x approaches infinity of e to the negative x what is the answer so if we plug in infinity this is going to be e to negative infinity which is 1 over e to the infinity e to the infinity is infinity and one divided by infinity is zero so as x approaches infinity for this graph it's going to be zero so even if we have this one too the limit as x approaches negative infinity for e to the positive x this would be e to negative infinity which is basically 1 over infinity that 2 is 0. if you were to graph e to the x it looks like this notice that it has a horizontal asymptote of y equals zero so as x approaches negative infinity that means if we follow a curve all the way to the left the y value becomes zero 

Transcript for: Limits and Logarithms
here's a question for you how would you evaluate this limit what is the limit as n goes to infinity of a 1 plus 1 over n raised to the n power well in this video we're going to talk about how to evaluate this limit so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to set the entire expression equal to y so our goal is to solve for y if we can do that we could find the value of this expression now the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to take the natural log of both sides so we're going to have ln y is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity and then the natural log of 1 plus 1 over n raised to the n now a property of logs let's say we have log x raised to the a we can take the exponent and move it to the front so ln x raised to the a power is a times ln x so we're going to take this variable move it to the front so we're going to have the natural log of y is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity n times the natural log of one plus one over n now we still have some more work to do here right now we have the product of two expressions n times ln one plus one over n we need to convert this expression from being a product of two expressions to a quotient of two expressions and here's how we can do that for instance a times b is equal to b divided by one over a so here we have a product of two expressions now we have a quotient of two expressions you can illustrate this with real numbers four times five which is twenty is equivalent to five divided by one fourth they both equal twenty so based on that we're going to convert this expression from n times the natural log of 1 plus 1 over n to ln 1 plus 1 over n divided by 1 over n the mathematically equivalent so now in this format we could use something called a l'hopital's rule which is useful for evaluating limits that approach infinity so we're going to take the derivative of the top and of the bottom let's start with the numerator the derivative of the natural log of u is equal to u prime over u so since the u variable is going to be the stuff inside of the natural log function that's going to be 1 plus 1 over n u prime is going to be the derivative of that expression the derivative of 1 is 0. now the derivative of 1 over n first we need to rewrite that as n to the minus one and then we need to use the power rule so it's going to be negative one n to the minus two and then we can rewrite that as negative one over n squared so using the formula u prime over u we're going to have ln y is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity and the derivative of that expression is going to be u prime which is negative 1 over n squared divided by u which is what we see here that's 1 plus 1 over n and all of that is divided by the derivative of one over n which is this again negative one over n squared whoa what just happened now let's get rid of that now the next thing that we need to do is cancel the two negative signs a negative divided by a negative sign is a positive sign and then we can multiply the numerator by n squared and the denominator by n squared so one over n squared times n squared this is just one and this becomes one so in the end we're going to get the natural log of y is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity this is one divided by one plus one over n all divided by one which we don't really need to write that so this is the expression that we now have now as n goes to infinity what happens to one over n let's say n is ten one divided by ten is point one if n increases to a hundred one divided by a hundred is .01 as n increases to a thousand one divided by a thousand is point zero zero one as n gets larger and larger one over n gets smaller and smaller as you can see it's getting close to zero so as n goes to infinity one over n approaches zero so applying this limit expression we can replace one over n with zero so we're gonna have ln y is equal to one over one plus zero which is basically one so the natural log of y is equal to one now the base of a natural log function is equal to e that's important because that's going to help us get the answer that we need here's a property of logs that you need to be familiar with log base a of b let's say that's equal to c to convert this from a logarithmic expression into an exponential expression here's what you can do a race to c is equal to b now applying that same process to the expression that we have in the upper right corner we could say that e raised to the first power is equal to one so therefore y is equal to e now going back to the original problem where we had this we said that y was equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of 1 plus 1 over n raised to the n because that's equal to y and y is equal to e this limit expression is equal to e so this right here is the answer to the problem so that's how you can get the number e e is equal to 2.71828 1 8 2 8 and then that continues on we can plug in numbers to get this result for instance let's make n equal to a large number let's say a thousand so if you type this in your calculator one plus one over a thousand raised to a thousand this is what you're going to get you're gonna get two point seven one six nine two three nine three two which is close to this answer but not quite now let's increase n from a thousand to a million a million is basically one times ten to the sixth it's easier to type it that way so if you plug in this number you're going to get one 2.718 two eight zero four six nine so this is really getting close to e now let's try one more let's try a billion a billion is one times ten to the nine so this is a very large number and this will give you at least according to my calculator 2.718281827 so the only thing that's different here is the last eight and the last seven but it's very very close so you can clearly see that as n gets larger and larger as an increase in let me say that again as n increases in value this entire expression approaches e and so that's one way in which we can get the number e using limits and natural logs so that's basically it for this video that's all i got and if you like this video don't forget to

Transcript for: Logarithms - e - Euler's Number
have you ever wondered what is e and where it comes from perhaps you've been exposed to this letter in math where you see the function f of x is equal to e to the x or maybe you've seen it when dealing with logarithms for instance let's say if we have log five if you don't see a base the base is always base ten but what about natural logs let's say ln5 the base of a natural log is e so this is the same as log base e of 5. so e is found in many areas of math but what is e e is a number e is equal to 2.718281828 and there's some other numbers after that but that's what it is but let's talk about where it comes from and how we can calculate that number so one way in which we can get this number is through this formula the compound interest formula where a is the future amount p is the principal or the original investment times 1 plus the interest rate received divided by n raised to the n t n is the number of times that you are paid interest in a year and t is the number of years so let's say that you invest a dollar for one year so t is going to be equal to one and we're going to say that the interest rate is a hundred percent 100 as a decimal is just one so if you are paid once in this year how much money will you have at the end well your one dollar investment will grow to two dollars at 100 interest but what about this is when n is one because you're paid once a year what if you're paid 100 but semi-annually that is two times in a year so n would be two in this case plugging everything into this formula you'll have p is one r is one n is two and t is going to be one so it's just gonna be one plus one half raised to the second power so after the end of the year you're going to have two dollars and 25 cents now instead of being paid the 100 interest twice a year what if was broken up into four times a year let's say if you receive quarterly payments in this case n would be four so it's going to be one plus one over four raised to the fourth power at the end of the year you'll have two dollars and 44 cents now what about if it's compounded monthly let's say if you receive 12 interest payments in one year so it's going to be 1 plus 1 over 12 raised to the 12 power which is 2.61 cents and then let's say if the interest was paid out daily that is if n is 365 this is going to be one plus one over 365 raised to the 365. you'll get two dollars and 71 cents now it turns out that as n approaches infinity that is if it's compounding continuously you'll get e which is 2.718 2 8 and so forth and you could test it out if you plug in a very large number for n you're going to get e so for instance if you plug in one plus one over let's say n is a million or one times ten to the sixth if you type this into your calculator you're going to get 2.718280469 which is approximately e so that's we could say that the limit as n goes to infinity of the expression 1 plus 1 over n raised to the n is e so that's where the number e comes from at least that's one way in which you can calculate it there are some other mathematical expressions that will give us the value of e here's another one the limit as n goes to zero of 1 plus n raised to the 1 over n is also e so if we were to make a table of values you can test this out if n is one you're gonna get two now if n is point one you'll get this number two point five nine three seven four two four six if n is point zero one you'll get two point seven zero four eight and then if you put .001 this will be 2.716924 0.0001 or one times ten to the minus four it'll give you a number that's close to e two point seven one eight one four five nine two and then if you use one to times ten to the minus six you'll get a number that's very close to e so as you can see for this particular expression as n gets very very small as it gets closer and closer to zero the expression one plus n raised to the one over n approaches e as we can see here in this table so that's another formula that can help you to calculate the value of e but we're not quite done yet because there is another way in which you can get the value of e it turns out that if you take the sum of one over n factorial from n equals zero to infinity this will also give you e so zero factorial if we have one plus i mean one over zero factorial plus one over 1 factorial plus 1 over 2 factorial we're not going to add all of it but we're just going to get a few numbers to see how close this gets to e let's stop at one over eight factorial zero factorial is one so one over one is one one factorial is also one two factorial is two so we get one half three factorial that's three times two times one which is six so this is gonna be one over six four factorial is four times three times two times one which is 24. 5 factorial just multiply 24 by 5 and that will give you 120 6 factorial just multiply 120 by 6 you get 720 7 factorial multiply seven twenty by seven you should get five thousand forty and eight factorial multiply five thousand forty by eight and you'll get forty thousand three hundred twenty now go ahead and plug these numbers into your calculator and see what value you get so this is equal to two point seven one eight two seven eight seven which is approximately e now granted if you keep adding more numbers like one like plus one over nine factorial plus one over ten factorial it's going to get closer and closer to e but as you go to infinity you'll get the value of e now there are also some other applications of e which is also known as euler's number for instance consider the graph y equals e to the x which looks like this the derivative of e to the x is also e to the x so what this means is that if you take the slope at any point of this function the slope of the tangent line is going to equal the y value at that point so y is going to equal m at some value of x so that's one interesting property of e or e to the x another one has to do with the area it turns out that the area is also equal to the y value of the graph so let's say let me draw another picture so let's say we want to find the area all the way from the left to some value x the area under the curve can be calculated by taking the definite integral of f of x from a to b in this case since we're starting all the way from the left a would be negative infinity so the area will be the integral from negative infinity to x of e to the x dx the antiderivative of e to the x is e c x now evaluated from a to b this is going to be e to the x minus e to the negative infinity e to the negative infinity is basically eats its zero or one over e to the infinity so you just get e to the x and since y is equal to e to the x thus we could say that y is equal to the area so the height of the graph at some value of x is equal to the area under the curve from negative infinity to x for this particular function so that's basically it so now you know what the value of e is how to calculate it and some

now let's talk about the squeeze term the main idea behind a squeeze term is that let's say that f ofx is greater than or equal to H of X but less than or equal to G of X so f is between H and G now if the limit as X approaches some number let's say a of H of X is the same as the limit as X approaches a of G of X and let's say that value is L then the limit as X approaches a of the middle function f ofx must also be equal to l if the small function and the large function have a value of L then the one in the middle should have the same limit L and that's the main idea behind the squeeze ter but let's work on some examples to apply it so for example let's say that f ofx is in between 8 - x cub and 8 + x cub what is the limit as X approaches Z of the function FX what's the answer so how can we figure this out well let's apply the limit to every expression in its inequality if f ofx is greater than 8 - x cub and if it's less than or equal to 8 + xB then we can say that the limit as X approaches zero of 8 - x Cub is less than or equal to the Limit as X approaches Z of f ofx Which is less than or equal to the Limit as X approaches Z of 8 + x Cub now let's go ahead and use direct substitution on the expression on the left so as we apply the limit as X approaches Z this is going to be 8 - 0 3r and the limit as X approaches zero of f ofx is greater than that but is less than or equal to 8 plus 0 to the 3r so this is eight and on the right side we also have eight so therefore if the limit as X approaches Zer if f ofx is greater than or equal to 8 and at the same time less than than or equal to 8 we could say that the limit as X approaches zero of f ofx is 8 that's the only way where it could be true it can't be seven because even though seven is less than eight seven is not greater than eight and it can't be nine because even though n is greater than eight n is not less than eight the only way this equation can be true is if we have an eight in the middle then are all equal to each other now let's work on another example let's try this one what is the limit as X approaches 2 of the function f ofx and let's say that f ofx is between 5x + 2 and also is between x^2 + 8 so go ahead and try that problem so let's find the limit as X approaches 2 of 5x + 2 and at the same time let's find the limit as X approaches 2 of x^2 + 8 so let's focus focus on the left side first let's use direct substitution so this is going to be 5 * 2 + 2 and on the right side if we replace x with 2 this is going to be 2^ 2 + 8 5 * 2 is 10 10 + 2 that's 12 on the right side 2^ 2 that's 2 * 2 which is 4 4 + 8 is 12 so therefore the only way that this expression can be true is if everything is equal to 12 so we can make the statement that the limit as X approaches 2 of f ofx must be equal to 12 according to the sque ter try this one what is the limit as X approaches zero of X sin x what is the answer to that question well let's talk about the graph of sign this is the graph of sign at least the right side of the graph and it has an amplitude of one so based on that sin x is between -1 and one including those values now if we take that inequality and if we multiply everything by X we can then say that X sin x is in between X and positive X so therefore we need to evaluate the limits at these two points let's do it two different ways the limit as X approaches zero ofx that's the left side that's equal to zero the limit as X approaches zero of positive X which is the right side is also equal to zero so according to the squeeze term we can say that the limit as X approaches zero for the middle function X sinx must also be equal to zero so you could do it that way if you want or we can just go back to our original w doing things so we could take the limit of each portion of this inequality we can divide it simultaneously if you prefer to do it this way so on the left the limit as X approaches Z of negative X we know it's zero and on the right the limit as X approaches zero of x X is zero so according to the squeeze theem the only way that these three inequalities can be true or these three parts of the inequality can be true is if that they're all equal to zero so the one in the middle the limit as X approaches zero of X sinx has to be equal to zero to make the inequality true so that's the answer what is the limit as X approach is z of X Cub * cosine 1 / X go ahead and try this problem now just like s cosine will always vary between -1 and 1 it really doesn't matter what this function is on the inside the period could change but any n is going to oscillate between 1 and 1 now it may oscillate quicker in the beginning and may spread out towards the end but in the end the oscillations will remain between 1 and negative 1 and that's what we want to take from cosine 1X so now what we're going to do is multiply everything by X Cub so we can make the statement thatx cub is less than or equal to X Cub cosine 1 /x which that itself is less than or equal to positive X Cub so now that we have this inequality we can now take the limit of all three portions of this inequality as X approaches zero so we can say that the limit as X approaches Z ofx cub that's going to be less than or equal to the Limit as X approaches zero of X Cub cosine 1/x Which is less than or equal to the Limit as X approaches zero of positive X Cub let's go ahead and make some space so now let's substitute x with 0 so we have 0 Cub on the left side the middle part is not going to change so we could just rewrite it and on the right side positive 0 Cube so negative 0 cube is simply just zero so we could see what the answer is going to be now if the limit as X approaches zero if it's greater than or equal to zero and at the same time less than or equal to zero there's only one possible answer for it it's equal to zero and so that's the answer for uh this problem and now you know how to apply the squeeze theorem so hopefully these were enough examples to help you understand this material 

Transcript for: Greatest Integer Function With Limits & Graphs
let's talk about the greatest integer function also known as the floor function and it looks like this this is the greatest integer of x now how can we apply it so for example what is the greatest integer of 0.7 how can we evaluate that so think of all the numbers that are less than 0.7 which of these numbers is the greatest the greatest integer that is less than 0.7 is 0. a technique that can help you figure this out is to draw a number line let's say this is zero one two three four 0.7 is right here on the number line so we need to do is pick the integer that is to the left of it all of these integers are less than 0.7 but the greatest of these is 0. so the greatest integer of 0.7 is 0. now what about the greatest integer of 1.8 what do you think that's going to be well this answer has to be one if we plot 1.8 on the number line all you need to do is pick the integer to the left and that will give you 1. what about the greatest integer of 2.3 this will equal 2. 2.3 is here if you go to the left the next integer is 2. but now let's move on to some negative values let's try a negative 1.6 what is the greatest integer of negative 1.6 and also do this one too negative 2.8 so if we plot negative 1.6 on the number line negative 1.6 is between negative 1 and negative 2. so you need to pick the next integer to the left which is negative 2. negative 1.6 is not greater than negative 1 but it is greater than negative 2. now for negative 2.8 if we plot it it's between negative two and negative three so if we pick the next integer to the left this will give us negative three now let's talk about how to graph this function so first let's put the marks on the graph so this is positive 4 and that's 4 as well so we know that the greatest integer of let's say point six is zero if we try let's say 0.3 that's also gonna be zero as well so therefore we should have a horizontal line between zero and one which will have a y value of zero so it looks like this it's going to be a closed circle at 0 but an open circle at 1. and then the pattern will repeat that's how you can graph the greatest integer function so for example let's say if we want to find the greatest integer of 1.4 so what you can do is choose an x value of 1.4 so that's between 1 and 2. so 1.4 should be somewhere over here then look at the y value notice that the y value is 1. so the greatest integer of 1.4 is one now let's say if we want to find the greatest integer function of three point two so three point two is between three and four so it should be somewhere over here and it corresponds to a y value of three so hopefully you see how this works now let's try a negative one let's say negative two point four what's the greatest integer of negative two point four negative 2.4 is between negative two and negative three and this corresponds to a y value of negative three you can also just go to the left which will give you negative 3 as well so now you know how to evaluate it using the the graph of the greatest integer function now what about this one what is the greatest integer of 2. so when x is 2 we don't use this one because that's an open circle we need to look for the closed circle which is here and that's equal to 2. so the greatest integer of negative one we would use this function that's also equal to negative one so if it's an integer itself it's going to equal that integer try these practice problems find the greatest integer function of 3.2 7.8 negative 3.2 and also negative 4.7 so go ahead and work on these for the sake of practice the greatest integer function of 3.2 we got to pick the greatest integer that's less than 3.2 so this is going to be 3. the highest integer that's less than 7.8 is 7. now negative 3.2 let's use the number line for this here's negative 3 this is negative 4 negative 2. so negative 3.2 is here so the greatest integer that's less than negative 3 is negative 4. the greatest integer that's less than negative 4.7 is negative 5. now try these two as well the greatest integer function of four is going to be four and the greatest integer of negative 5 is itself negative 5. now let's evaluate it with limits what is the limit as x approaches 0 of the greatest integer function of x so what do you think we need to do here so we need to check the one-sided limits let's start with the left side so what is the limit as x approaches 0 from the left of the greatest integer function so let's plug in a number left of 0 we can use negative 0.1 what is the greatest integer of negative 0.1 if we use the number line here's zero here's negative one negative point one is between zero and negative one so we gotta pick the number to left this is gonna be negative one so as we approach zero from the left it's going to equal negative one and recall you can always use the graph you know the graph looks like this so at negative one well zero to the left if we approach zero from the left side notice that it's equal to negative one using the graph now what about the limit as x approaches zero from the right so what is the greatest integer function of positive point one well positive point one is greater than zero so this is going to be zero and as we approach zero an x value of zero from the right side notice that the y value is zero it's on the x axis so you can analyze it graphically or you can just plug it in you can plug in numbers because the left-sided and the right-sided limit do not match because they're different the limit does not exist what is the limit as x approaches 2 from the left of the greatest integer function of x plus 3x so 2 to the left we can plug in 1.9 so let's focus on this portion first what is the greatest integer of 1.9 so out of all the integers that are less than point nine which one is the greatest this is going to be one so as x approaches two from the left the greatest integer of x will be one and then for three x we can plug in two so it's going to be 1 plus 6 so the final answer is 7. now the way you may want to show your work on the test you may want to separate the greatest integer function of x and also separate 3x so you may want to write the limit twice so we know that the limit as x approaches 2 from the left of the greatest integer function of x it has to be 1. and for this side you can just use direct substitution that's gonna be three times two and in the end you should get seven but some teachers may want you to write out each step first so you may have to do it that way depending on what teacher you have what is the limit as x approaches negative 3 from the left of 5 minus 2 times the greatest integer function of x so first let's rewrite it as 5 minus 2 times the limit as x approaches negative 3 from the left of the greatest integer function of x now let's focus on this portion of the expression negative 3 from the left what number should we plug in to represent that so here's negative 3 this is negative 4 and this is negative 2. so negative 3 from the left side means that we need to plug in a number that's between negative 3 and negative 4. so we can plug in negative 3.1 so what is the greatest integer of negative 3.1 it's a negative 3.1 which we already plotted the greatest integer is going to be to the left of that so that's going to be negative 4. so since the limit as x approaches negative 3 from the left side of the greatest integer function of x that's equal to negative four we can now find the value of this expression so it's five minus two times negative four negative two times negative four is positive eight and five plus eight is thirteen so 13 is the answer what is the limit as x approaches 3 of this expression 2 minus the greatest integer function of negative x so because we're dealing with three from either side we need to check the left side and the right side so let's start with the left side first so this is going to be 2 minus the limit as x approaches 3 from the left of the greatest integer function of negative x so if we plug in a number that's to the left of 3 that would be like 2.9 but now notice that we have a negative x on the inside so what we need to do is find out the greatest integer of negative 2.9 negative two point nine is greater than negative three but less than negative two so the answer is negative three and you can always use the number line for that so here's negative two this is a negative three and here's negative one negative two point nine is just to the right of negative three so to find the greatest integer always look to the left and so that's negative three so this should equal negative three so we have two minus negative three so on the left side it's equal to positive five now let's evaluate it on the right side so on the right side we need to plug in a number that's greater than 3 because x approaches 3 from the right so greater than 3 is 3.1 but now to plug in 3.1 the sign is going to reverse it's going to become negative 3.1 so now what is the greatest integer of negative 3.1 negative 3.1 is between negative 3 and 4. so negative 4 is less than negative three but it's greater than all of the integers that are less than negative three so this is negative four so this becomes two minus negative four so the right side of limit is going to be two plus four which is six now because these two do not match we could say that the limit does not exist let's try one more problem let's try the limit as x approaches negative two from the left of the greatest integer function of negative x so try this problem pause the video negative two from the left what number should we use to represent it so here's negative 2 negative 3 negative 1. so we need to pick a number that's to the left of negative 2. so negative 2.1 could be a good representation of something that's to the left of negative 2. so let's plug in negative 2.1 so we have a negative and then negative 2.1 so we're looking for the greatest integer of positive 2.1 because the two negative signs will cancel 2.1 is to the right of 2. so the greatest integer is going to be positive 2. so therefore that's the answer the limit as x approaches negative 2 from the left side which is like 2 negative 2.1 and if we plug that into negative x that becomes positive 2.1 which the greatest integer of that is positive 2. so that's the answer for this question you 

Transcript for: Limits of Logarithmic Functions | Calculus
consider this problem what is the limit as x approaches e of the expression ln x minus 1 over x minus e how can we evaluate this logarithmic limit well we can try direct substitution we can replace x with e so we're going to have l and e minus one divided by e minus e the natural log of e is one and so one minus one is zero e minus e is also zero so this is indeterminate this is not going to work now we could try using l'hopital's rule to see if we can get the answer since we have an indeterminate form and here's the gist of l'hopital's rule let's say if we want to evaluate the limit as x approaches a of f of x over g of x this is equal to the limit as x approaches a of f prime of x divided by g prime of x so if we were to take the derivative of the top and the bottom we would get the derivative of ln x is just one over x the derivative of negative one is zero the derivative of x is one the derivative of e is a constant that's zero so this becomes one over x well technically the limit as x approaches e of one over x so the final answer for this problem is 1 over e because at this point we could use direct substitution so that's how we can evaluate this particular limit now we can check our answer just to make sure that it is indeed the right answer so this entire answer is one over e let's get the decimal value of that one over e is equal to 0.3678794412 now e is a number as well e is equal to 2.718281828 and the pattern continues we're going to plug in an x value that is close to e as x continues to approach e if we get this number then we know our answer is correct so let's start with 2.7 if x is 2.7 what is the value of that expression so ln 2.7 minus 1 divided by 2.7 minus e if you plug this in you should get point three six nine one two two one zero four two so it's not too far away from this valley but let's pick uh a number that's even closer let's try 2.718 so if we plug in ln 2.718 minus 1 over 2.718 minus e so this becomes point three six seven eight nine eight five one three two so this is even closer to the actual answer and we can try one more let's try two point seven one eight two eight so i got point three six seven eight seven nine five six five four and that's close enough i mean we have the first six digits correct after decimal which i think is pretty good but that's how you can evaluate this particular limit the best thing to do the most efficient way is to use l'hopital's rule because we have an indeterminate form zero over zero so we have this indeterminate form or infinity over the infinity you could use l'hopital's rule to evaluate the limit so that's it for this video thanks for watching and don't forget to subscribe to this channel 

Transcript for: Limits of Natural Logarithmic Functions - Calculus
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the limit of natural log functions so let's start with the first example what is the limit as X approaches 0 from the right of Ln X now if we were to plug in 0 into that function you would get an undefined answer I learned zero doesn't exists and if we draw a graph we could see why so Ln X has a vertical asymptote that the y-axis at x equals zero it has an x-intercept that one and it looks like this so that's a rough sketch of the graph y equals Ln X so as we follow the curve as we approach X from the right side notice that it goes down towards negative Infinity so that's the limit as X approaches zero is on the right side now from the left side notice that the function is not defined on the left side the domain for the lnx function is from 0 to Infinity it doesn't exist on the left side so we could put DNE doesn't exist so the limit as X approaches 0 from either side because these two are different well this limit doesn't exist either in order for this limit to exist the left side limit and the right side limit they must be the same now what about this problem what is the limit as X approaches zero of Ln X but instead of this x we're going to have the absolute value of x so feel free to try that problem now it really helps to draw the graph now we know that L and X it looks like this this is a rough sketch of L and X now that we have the absolute value of x can be positive or negative so we're going to get the reflection of that graph across the y-axis however X can't be zero because Ln 0 does not exist so the domain for this function is from negative Infinity to zero Union zero to Infinity so Ln 0 doesn't exist but what about the limit as X approaches zero in order to find this answer we need to check the one-sided limits so let's start with the right side as we approach Zero from the right so as we follow this curve and approach an x value of zero notice that it goes down towards negative Infinity now if we check the left-sided limit we're going to get a similar answer so as we follow this graph and approach and approach Zero from the left side it too goes to negative Infinity so because these two are the same the limit as X approaches 0 4 the for the natural log of the absolute value of x that's going to be negative Infinity this limit does exist even though Ln 0 does not exist now what about this one the limit as X approaches zero from the left of the natural log of cosine X feel free to pause the video if you want to try this example by the way for those of you who want more examples on limits feel free to check out the problems in the description section of the video I'm going to be posting more links to other topics on limits so feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance so what is the limit as X approaches 0 from the less of the natural log of cosine X so what we have here is a composite function a function within another function in order to evaluate this limit we need to evaluate the limit as X approaches zero from the left of the function within now for this function cosine X we can use direct substitution because if you were to draw the graph of cosine it looks like this so as we approach Zero from the right or from the left the Y value is 1. so the limit as X approaches zero for cosine X is simply one and the natural log of one is equal to zero use indirect substitution so that's all we got to do for this problem thank you but now let's say we want to find the limit as X approaches 0 from the right for this time it's going to be the natural log of the sine function go ahead and try that so this is going to be Ln and the limit as X approaches 0 from the right of sine now for this one we need to be careful I'm going to draw the graph of sine y equals sine X looks like this now as the x value approaches zero notice that y approaches 0 as well so the limit as X approaches 0 from the right of sine X is zero however Ln 0 does not exist so direct substitution will not help us when solving this composite function but nevertheless we could still get an answer for this problem so we need to understand that as X approaches zero from the right y approaches zero but this is important it's in which side this y approach Zero from the left or from the right what would you say now really think about that because this is going to determine the answer of the overall problem if we follow the Curve notice that the Y values they go from a positive value to zero so at this point Y might be one here might be 0.5 and now it's zero so Y is approaching Zero from the right or from above and we Define sine X to be y so as X approaches zero from the right y equals sine X that y value approaches zero from the right as well so what we're going to have now is Ln as y approaches zero from the right and I'm going to replace sine X with y now we know the answer to this because earlier in this video we said that the limit I need to rewrite this I did not write this correctly so this is supposed to be the limit as y approaches 0 from the right of Ln y now earlier in this video we said that the limit as X approaches zero from the right of Ln X that was negative Infinity and the same is true for the limit as y approaches 0 from the right of l and y that 2 will be negative Infinity so this is the final answer now if we had this as y approaches 0 from the left for Ln y that would be doesn't exist it would give us this answer so it's important for us to identify whether Y is approaching Zero from the right or from the left when dealing with the limit of composite functions like this by the way I do have another video on YouTube that covers limits of composite functions for those of you who want more specific examples like this and I'm going to be posting that in the description section below so feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance now let's try this problem what is the limit as X approaches 3 from the right of the natural log of x squared minus 9. go ahead and try that problem now if we were to use direct substitution we'll get 3 squared minus 9. 3 squared is nine nine minus nine is zero that Ln 0 doesn't exist however that may not give us the right answer so we need to use some other techniques here the first thing we can do is we can Factor this expression so we have the difference of two squares so a squared minus B squared is going to be a plus b times a minus B so x squared minus nine when you factor it it's going to be X plus 3 times x minus 3 and all of this is within the natural log function now a certain property of logs allows us to expand it so Ln a times B is equivalent to Ln a Plus lnb so we can rewrite this expression like this we can split up problem into two separate logs so we're going to have the limit as X approaches 3 from the right of Ln X plus three and the limit as X approaches 3 from the right of Ln x minus 3. now for the one on the left we could use direct substitution so this becomes Ln 3 plus 3 which is ln6 now I mean that was the one on the left now the one on the right for this one we should graph this one because we have a vertical asymptote now we know the graph of L and X Ln X looks like this with the y-axis being the vertical asymptote which is x equals zero now this one is equivalent to Ln X but it's been shifted three units to the right so because we have the expression x minus 3 if you set that equal to zero you get a new vertical asymptote at x equals positive three so the graph y equals Ln x minus 3 is going to look like this it shifted three units to the right so now with this graph we could evaluate the limit as X approaches 3 from the right side then three is the vertical asymptote so as we approach 3 from the right we can see it's going to negative Infinity so ln6 plus negative Infinity that's going to be negative Infinity so this is the final answer so that's how you can evaluate the limit of natural log functions if you can graph it I recommend doing that because you can just literally see what the answer is going to be if not you can employ the techniques that we've used in this video so that's it for this video thanks again for watching thank you 

Transcript for: Intermediate Value Theorem
now let's talk about ivt the intermediate value theorem the intermediate value theorem states that if f is continuous on a closed interval a to b and f of a does not equal f of b and k is any number that's between f of a and f b then there's at least one number c on the interval a to b such that f c is equal to k now let's go ahead and apply this information so how can you use the intermediate value theorem to show that there's a root or a zero in this function within the specified interval where the interval is from 0 to 2. how can you use the intermediate value theorem to prove that go ahead and try so first we need to find the value of f of a and f b in this case f of 0 and f of 2. a is 0 b is 2. so f of 0 is going to equal negative 2. now let's find the value of f of b or f of two which is two to the third plus four times two minus two two to the third is eight four times two is also eight eight plus 8 is 16 minus 2 that's 14. so f of a is negative 2 f of b is 14. now keep in mind k is between f of a and f of b so k is between negative 2 and 14. and our goal is to show that there is a root or a number that's equal to zero so we got to show that there's some value c where k is zero and zero is between negative two and fourteen so there is some value out there where k can be zero because zero is in within this range if you think about it if we have some function where f of 0 is negative 2 and f of 2 is 14 so that's probably way up here and if it's continuous at some point let me draw a better line at some point the curve has to cross the x-axis so there's some value where f of c is equal to zero and keep in mind f of c is k so there's some value where k is equal to zero so there's going to be a root or zero in the equation in order to find it we need to set f of x equal to zero and then we could solve for x we know it's somewhere between zero and two it's not one because if we plug in 1 we're going to get positive 3. so technically it's going to be between 0 and 1. let's try a different example so let's say that f of x is equal to x squared plus x minus one on the interval zero to five and that f of c is equal to eleven so the instructions are going to be different from the last example verify that the intermediate value theorem applies to the indicated interval and find the value of c guaranteed by the intermediate value theorem so first we got to make sure it applies to the interval so we've got to find f of a and f of b so f of 0 is 0 squared plus 0 minus 1 which is negative 1. so that's f of a f of b which is the same as f 5 is going to be 5 squared plus 5 minus 1. 5 squared is 25 plus 5 that's 30 minus 1 that's 29 so that's the value of f b k has to be between negative 1 and 29 now keep in mind f of c is equal to k so therefore k is 11. so 11 is between negative 1 and 29 so the intermediate value theorem does apply to this function within this interval so now we got to find f of c i mean not f c but the value of c f of c is 11. so we're going to set 11 equal to the function f of x and find the value of x so let's subtract both sides by 11 to begin with so x squared plus x minus 12 is equal to zero so now we can factor we need to find two numbers that multiply to negative 12 that adds to the middle coefficient of one so this is going to be positive four and negative three so therefore we're gonna have x plus four and x minus three so we can see that x is equal to negative four and positive three so now which x value is the actual value of c is it negative 4 is it negative is it positive 3 or is it both now we need to find out which one is in the interval negative four is not between zero and five but positive three is between zero and five so c is equal to this particular x value so c is equal to three f of three is eleven and three is in the interval it's between a and b so this is our answer c is three here's a problem that you can work on use the intermediate value theorem to show that there is a number c where f of c is equal to 9 on the interval 0 to 3 given a function f of x is equal to 2x squared minus three x plus seven in addition find the value of c so first let's evaluate the function at a and b so let's find the function value when x is zero so let's plug it into that equation so it's going to be two times zero squared minus three times zero plus seven so that's equal to seven now let's evaluate the function when x is equal to three so it's two times three squared minus three times three plus seven three squared is nine and two times nine is eighteen three times three is nine and then eighteen minus nine is nine nine plus seven is sixteen now f of c is equal to nine and nine is basically the k value so we could say k is 9. so notice that k or 9 is between 16 and 7. therefore c which is an x value has to be between a and b so c is between three and zero now let's go ahead and calculate c so let's set the function equal to k or nine so two x squared minus three x plus seven will be set equal to nine so if we subtract both sides by nine seven minus nine is negative two so we're going to have negative two on the left side now we need to factor this trinomial and the leading coefficient is not one it's two so we need to multiply the leading coefficient by the constant term two times negative two is negative four and we need to find two numbers that multiply to negative four but add to the middle coefficient negative three so that's negative four and one now we're going to replace negative 3x with negative 4x plus 1x and then factor by grouping so in the first two terms take out the gcf which is 2x 2x squared divided by 2x is x negative 4x divided by 2x that's going to be negative 2. now in the last two terms there's nothing to take out so take out a one if we take out a one we're still going to get x minus two now we need to factor the greatest common factor again this time it's x minus two so if we take out an x minus two we're going to get two x plus one so now we have everything that we need and this is still equal to zero by the way so now we need to set each factor equal to zero so if we add two to both sides we can see that x is equal to two for this one we need to subtract both sides by one so two x is equal to negative one and then divide both sides by two so x can be equal to two or negative one half now which of these two answers should we choose two or negative one half which one is between zero and three negative one half is outside of that range so therefore c is equal to two f of two is equal to nine and two is between zero and three so this is our answer right here c is equal to two you

now let's talk about continuity this graph is continuous everywhere there's no jumps or breaks in the graph now in this example we have a point of discontinuity at some x value which we'll call C now this particular type of discontinuity is known as a whole here's another type of discontinuity and this one is called a jump discontinuity because the left side and right side do not connect and then there's another type this type of discontinuity is known as an infinite discontinuity as you approach the vertical Asm toote on the right side it approaches positive Infinity on the left negative Infinity now you need to know that the hole is a removable discontinuity but the other two the jump discontinuity and the infinite discontinuity are non removable discontinuities now let's talk about how to identify points of discontinuity in a graph so here's the first example 1/x^2 if you're given a rational function you could find the vertical ASM toote which is an infinite discontinuity by setting the denominator equal to zero so in this case the vertical ASM toote is x equal Z so therefore that's a point of discontinuity because in this graph there is no x value of zero it's undefined at that point and as you can see we have an infinite discontinuity so here's another example let's say if we have 5 / by x + 2 X+ 2 cannot be zero because that's going to be the vertical ASM toote so therefore X cannot be -2 that is the point of discontinuity if we graph this function we're going to have a vertical ASM toote at x = -2 and so the graph is going to look something like this so this is another infinite discontinuity now what about a function that looks like this let's say 3 * x + 2 / x + 2 * x - 5 the x - 5 Factor on the bottom leads to the vertical asto so X cannot equal Al POS so that is an infinite discontinuity anytime It's associated with a vertical ASM toote it's an infinite discontinuity now notice that we can cancel x + 2 however this is still a point of discontinuity so X cannot equal -2 but this type of discontinuity is known as a whole if it can be cancelled here's another problem f X is equal to the absolute value of x / X so what type of discontinuity do we have in this example is it a whole a jump discontinuity or an infinite discontinuity also determine if it's removable or non removable now we know that the denominator can be zero so X cannot equal zero but notice that we have an absolute value function so this could be positive X which means F ofx can be 1 or it could be Nega X which means F ofx can be equal to 1 this is true when X is greater than zero and this is true when X is less than zero so the graph looks something like this when X is greater than zero it's going to be positive 1 and when it's less than zero negative 1 so this is the jump discontinuity and it usually occurs whenever you have an absolute value function like this or it could be due to a peie wise function as well now a jump discontinuity is also a non removable discontinuity the only one that's removable is the whole now let's say if we have a pie wise function 5x + 3 x^2 + 4 and X Cub so it's going to be 5x + 3 when X is less than 1 and when X is between 1 and 2 f ofx is going to equal X2 + 4 and then it's going to be X Cub when X is equal to or greater than two so determine the points of discontinuity now looking at this function linear function funs are always continuous everywhere quadratic functions are also continuous even cubic functions so any polom function is continuous everywhere rational functions like this one will be discontinuous when the denominator is zero but we don't have a rational function here so for peie wise function the only possible locations where it can be discontinuous is at an x value of one or at an x value of two and a quick way to tell is to see if the yv value is the same at those points so let's start with one if we plug in one into 5x + 3 we're going to get a value of eight and if we plug it into the second part x^2 + 4 we're going to get a value of five therefore it's discontinuous at x = 1 now what about x = 2 so we need to use these two functions if we plug in 2 into x^2 + 4 it's going to be 2^ 2 + 4 which is 8 and 2 to the 3 power is also 8 now because these two have the same y value you know that it's continuous at x = 2 but is discontinuous at x = 1 consider the function f ofx which is equal to CX + 3 when X is less than 2 and that's equal to 3x + C when X is equal to or greater than 2 What is the value of the constant C that will make the function continuous at xal 2 so what do we need to do in order to find the value of that constant C well if it's going to be continuous at xal 2 these two functions have to have the same yvalue which means that they must be equal to each other so the first thing is to set them equal to each other and they have to be equal to each other at an x value of two so the second step is to replace x with two and then find the value of C so we're going to have 2 C + 3 is equal to 6 + C so let's subtract both sides by C and let's subtract both sides by 3 2 c - c is C 6 - 3 is 3 so C is equal to three now what about this problem let's say that f ofx is equal to ax - 2 and also x^2 - 5 when X is less than 3 and when X is equal to or greater than three find the value of the constant a that will make the function continuous so go ahead pause the video and try this problem so the the first thing we need to do is set the two portions of the function equal to each other and then in the next step we need to replace x with 3 so this is going to be a * 3 - 2 is = to 3^ 2 - 5 so this is going to be 3 a - 2 which is equal to 9 - 5 and 9 - 5 is 4 now if we add two to both sides 4 + 2 is six and then we have to divide both sides by three so 6 / 3 is 2 so the value of the constant is two let's try another problem so let's say f ofx is ax + 5 when X is less than 1 and that it's x^2 - BX + 9 when X is between 1 and 4 4 and it's ax^2 - BX - 7 when X is equal to or greater than four go ahead and find the values of A and B so first let's make the function continuous when X is one so therefore we need to set these two equations equal to each other so ax + 5 is equal to x^2 - BX + + 9 now let's replace x with 1 so this is going to be 1 a or just a 1^ 2 is 1 - B * 1 or B + 9 1 + 9 is 10 so a + 5 is equal to 10 minus B now let's add B to both sides and let's subtract both sides by five so on the left what we have is A + B on the right we have 10 - 5 so a plus b is equal to 5 now let's use the next number four so we need to set these two functions equal to each other so x^2 - BX + 9 is equal to ax^2 - BX - 7 and X is 4 so 4^ 2 - 4 b + 9 is equal to 4 or a * 4^ 2 - B * 4 - 7 so 4^ 2 is 16 and this is going to be 16 A minus 4 b - 7 so if we add 4B to both sides notice that we can cancel the B expressions since they're the same so therefore 16 is equal to 16 a - 7 and let's not forget about the plus 9 on that side 16 + 9 is 25 and that's equal to 16 a minus 7 but now since we're run out of space let's clear away a few things so now let's add seven to both sides 25 + 7 is 32 so 32 is equal to 16 a and if we divide both sides by 16 a is 32 / 16 which is 2 now that we have the value of a we can plug it in here to get the value of B so 2 + B is equal to 5 therefore B is 5 - 2 which is 3 so now you have the value of a and b

consider the pwi function f ofx and let's say that it's equal to 5x + 3 when X is less than 2 and it's equal to 2x^2 + 5 when X is between 2 and 4 and then it = X Cub - 5x + 3 when X is equal to or greater than 4 so what is the limit as X approaches 2 from the left side of f ofx so which portion of the pie wise function should we use now as we approach two from the left side should we choose a value like 1.99 or 2.01 on a number line here's two here's 1.99 and here's 2.01 so as weach approach two from the left side we have to pick a value that's less than two ideally 1.99 so therefore we need to use 5x + 3 because that's when X is less than two that's the left side of x = 2 so it's going to be 5 * 2 2 + 3 which is 10 + 3 so that's equal to 13 now what is the limit as X approaches 2 from the right of f ofx on the right side that is greater than 2 we need to use this portion of the peie wise function 2x^2 + 5 so it's 2 * 2^ 2 + 5 2^ 2 is 4 2 * 4 is 8 8 + 5 is 13 now let's find the limit as X approaches two from either side so because these two are the same you know that it's going to be 13 now here's the next question what is the value of f of two which function or which portion of the piecewise function should we use to find the value of f of two so X doesn't equal two for this particular portion of the function but it does equal two in this function so we're going to have to use 2x^2 + 5 which we already know what the answer is this is equal to 13 so F of 2 is defined now what is the limit as X approaches four from the left side so from the left side of four that is when X is less than 4 we need to use 2x^2 + 5 so it's going to be 2 * 4^ 2 + 5 4^ 2 is 16 2 * 16 is 32 32 + 5 well that's equal to 37 now what is the value of the limit as X approaches 4 from the right side this time x has to be greater than four so we need to use this portion of the peie wise function so let's plug in four 4 the 3r 4 * 4 is 16 * 4 that's 64 5 * 4 is 20 and 64 - 20 is 44 and 44 + 3 that's 47 so even though the one-sided limits exists because they don't match the limit itself does not exist so the limit as X approaches four from either side does not exist in this particular uh problem now there's one more question that we need to answer what is the value of f of four so when X is four what is the value of the function X is four using this portion of the P wise function and so as we mentioned before this is going to be 47 so let's work on another example so here's another peie wise function when X is less than 1 1 we have the portion 7X - 5 and then the function is going to be equal to 3x^2 - x when X is greater than 1 but less than or equal to three now the function will have a value of five when X is equal to 1 and it's going to be X Cub + 4 when X is greater than 3 so using this information what is the limit as X approaches pos1 from the left side so one from the left side that's less than one so therefore we have to use 7X - 5 so that's going to be 7 * 1 - 5 7 - 5 is 2 so that's the value of the left-sided limit now what about the right side limit as X approaches one from the right side what is the value of f ofx so this time we need to use 3x^ 2 - x 1^ 2 is 1 * 3 that's 3 - one that's going to be equal to two so because these two the left side the limit and the right side limit because they're the same the limit as X approaches one from either side will also be equal to two now what is the value of f of one so when X is exactly one what is the value of the function so when X is one notice that the value of the function is five so F of 1 is equal to 5 now what is the limit at as X approaches three from the left side so that's when X is less than three so we got to use 3x^ 2 - x so let's plug in three it's going to be 3 * 3^ 2 - 3 3^ 2 is 9 * 3 that's 27 27 - 3 is 24 now what about the right sided limit what is the limit as X approaches 3 from the right side so when X is greater than 3 we need to use this portion of the equation so X Cub + 4 so it's going to be 3 3r + 4 that's uh 27 + 4 which is 31 so the left side limit and the right side limit there's a mismatch they don't equal the same thing they're therefore the limit as X approaches 3 from either side we could say does not exist now what is the value of f of3 to find the value of f of three we need to use this portion because X is less than and equal to 3 when we plug in 3 into 3x^2 - x we got 24 so F of 3 is 24 consider the function f ofx which is equal to CX + 3 when X is less than 2 and that's equal to 3x + C when X is equal to or greater than 2 What is the value of the constant C that will make the function continuous at xal 2 so what do we need to do in order to find the value of that constant C well if it's it's going to be continuous at xal 2 these two functions have to have the same y value which means that they must be equal to each other so the first thing is to set them equal to each other and they have to be equal to each other at an x value of two so the second step is to replace x with two and then find the value of C so we're going to have 2 C + 3 is equal to 6 + C so let's subtract both sides by C and let's subtract both sides by three 2 c - c is C 6 - 3 is 3 so C is equal to 3 

Transcript for: 3 Step Continuity Test, Discontinuity, Piecewise Functions & Limits | Calculus
how can we prove that a function is continuous at a certain point how can we do so there's something called the three-step continuity test and the first step is that you have to show that the function is defined at some point a so F of a has to exist it has to equal a certain value the second step is to show that the limit as X approaches a of f ofx exists now how do we do that how do we show that this limit exists well you need to show that the left side limit the limit as X approaches a from the left side is indeed equal to the Limit as X approaches a from the right side only under those conditions will the limit exists now the third step is to show that the limit as X approaches a from either side of f ofx is indeed equal to F of a so that's the three-step continuity test so let's go ahead and apply it with a certain example so let's say that the function f ofx is equal to the sare < TK of x + 2 when X is less than 2 and it's equal to x^2 - 2 when X is between 2 and 3 and it's equal to 2x plus let's say 5 when X is equal to or greater than three so go ahead and prove that the function is Contin ous or discontinuous at 2 and 3 so let's start with an x value of two so therefore we need to use these two functions so what is f of two to find F of two we need to use the second function because X is greater than or equal to 2 so that's going to be 2^ 2 - 2 which is 4 - 2 so that's equal to 2 so F of a is defined that's step one step two we need to show that the limit exists so first we need to find the value of the limit as X approaches two from the left side of f ofx so on the left side of two that's when X is less than two so we got to use this function and so that's going to be the square < TK of 2 + 2 which is the square < TK of 4 and that's equal to two so now we got to check the right side the limit as X approaches two from the on the right on the right side x is greater than two so we're going to use this function x^2 - 2 so that's 2^ 2us 2 which we know is two now because the left side and the right side are the same that means that the limit indeed exists so we can say that the limit as X approaches two from either side of f ofx is equal to 2 now notice that these two are the same so now we can make the statement for step three that the limit as X approaches a or 2 of f ofx is indeed equal to F of two because they both equal two so therefore the function is continuous at x = 2 now let's move on to the next example and that is at an x value of three so we need to use these two uh functions so first let's determine if it's defined at three so F of 3 x is equal to 3 in the third part of the function so it's going to be 2 * 3 + 5 2 * 3 is 6 6 + 5 is 11 now let's move on to step two let's find the limit as X approaches three from the left side so therefore we need to use this function 3 from the left is going to be less than 3 so it's 3^ 2 - 2 3^ 2 is 9 9 - 2 is 7 now let's find as X approaches three from the right so we have to use this expression so it's going to be 2 * 3 + 5 which is 6 + 5 that's 11 now notice that the left side and the right side of the limit doesn't match so therefore the limit as X approaches 3 of f ofx does not exist and if the limit does not exist it is not continuous at xal 3 so therefore you could say it is discontinuous at xal 3 now because these two points do not match and we don't have a rational function this type of discontinuity is known as a jump discontinuity now let's work on some more examples here's another problem that you could try let's say that f ofx is equal to 2x + 5 when X is less than1 and is equal to x^2 + 2 when X is greater than1 and then it's equal to 5 when X is equal to 1 rather negative 1 so there's only one x value that we need to be concerned about and that x value is 1 so go ahead and determine if it's continuous or discontinuous at1 and if it's discontinous determine the type of discontinuity use the three-step continuity test to do so so first we need to determine if the function is defined at1 so what is the value of f of1 when X is exactly ne1 what is y notice that Y is 5 when X is 1 so f of1 is is five so therefore F of a is defined so we finished with uh step one now step two we need to prove that the limit exists so let's find the limit as X approaches -1 from the left side so from the left side x has to be less than one I mean less than negative 1 so this is going to be 2 * 1 + 5 we need to use this function so that's -2 + 5 which is equal to 3 now let's find the limit as X approaches ne1 from the right side so on the right of negative 1 we need to use x^2 + 2 because X is greater than 1 so that's going to be -12 + 2 which is 1 + 2 that's posi 3 now because these two are the same the limit exists so the limit as X approaches -1 of f ofx from either side is indeed equal to three so we finished with step two now let's focus on step three does the limit as X approaches Nega 1 of f ofx does it equal F of a notice that these two do not match they're not the same so in step three we can make the statement that the limit as X approaches -1 of f ofx does not equal F of1 so therefore step three has failed which means that it is discontinuous at netive 1 but the limit exists so what type of discontinuity do we have in this case if the limit exists we have this situation we have a hole but the function is not defined at the hole the limit has a yvalue of three but the function has a yvalue of five so what we have is a hole basically a removable discontinuity in the last example the jump discontinuity was a non- removable discontinuity so if step two fails if these two values are different typically it's the jump discontinuity if those two values are the same and if step three fails then usually it's going to be a hole the only time you get an infinite discontinuity is if these values equal Infinity so if you don't have an Infinity value it's not going to be an infinite discontinuity e 

Transcript for: Continuity and Differentiability
in this video i want to talk about continuity and differentiability so what's the basic idea behind continuity let's start with that so let me give you a graphical example so looking at this graph would you say it's continuous or discontinuous on the interval from a to b as you can see there's no breaks there's no jumps this graph connects from a to b there's no missing points so we could say that f of x is a continuous function from a to b now what are some examples of functions that are not continuous so let's call this a b and c so on the interval from a to c notice that we have a jump discontinuity as you can see there is no connection between the left part of the graph and the right part of the graph therefore this is a discontinuous function it's not continuous now there are some other types of discontinuities that you need to be familiar with so this type of discontinuity at point c is known as a hole so that's a type of removable discontinuity the jump discontinuity is a non-removable discontinuity and another one you need to be familiar with is the infinite discontinuity which usually occurs at a vertical asymptote as you can see this side goes all the way up to positive infinity and this side goes down to negative infinity so for example let's say if you have a rational function like 1 over x minus 2. x cannot equal 2 because this function will be undefined you'll have a 0 in the denominator and so you're gonna have a vertical asymptote at x equals two and that's going to be a point of discontinuity so anytime you have a vertical asymptote it's discontinuous at that point so those are some examples of functions that are not continuous now what about differentiability what's the main idea behind that continuity tells us if the original function f of x if it's continuous or discontinuous at some point differentiability tells us if the first derivative if it's continuous or not so differentiability describes the continuity of the first derivative function so let me give you some examples some graphical examples where a function may be continuous but not differentiable but let's look at our first example so we said this is a continuous function from a to b there's no breaks in the graph now notice that the curve is smooth everywhere from a to b there's no sharp turns when you see that that means that it's differentiable everywhere the slope doesn't change erratically anytime you see a smooth graph that means it's differentiable everywhere on in this function so that means that the first derivative f prime of x where this is f x is continuous on the interval from a to b now let's move on to our next example and let's focus on this function the absolute value of x so the graph is basically the shape of a v so notice that this function is continuous we don't have any holes no jump discontinuities or infinite discontinuities so f of x is continuous everywhere on the interval from negative infinity to infinity but now is it differentiable notice that we have a sharp turn at x equals zero the slope changes instantly from negative one to one so what is the slope at this point there is no slope at that point so that means that it's not differentiable at x equals zero which means that the first derivative is not continuous at x equals zero now what we're going to do is we're going to break this function into a piecewise function so on the right side we have the graph of positive x and the left side is negative x so it's x when x is greater than zero and negative x when x is less than zero and when x is equal to zero the y value of this function is zero so we could describe the absolute value of x using this piecewise function now what about f prime of x we know that the derivative of positive x is one and the derivative of negative x is negative one what about at x equals zero what's the slope so we can clearly see that the slope of the right side is equal to one and the slope on the left side is negative one and so if we plot f prime of x we're going to get a graph that looks like this so here's 1 and negative 1. so on the right side where x is greater than zero the slope is going to be one and it's always one so we're going to have a horizontal line and for the left side the slope is negative one now we don't know what the slope is at zero looking at this v shape graph the slope changes instantaneously from negative one to one it doesn't go through negative point five negative point two zero or point three they just change instantaneously from negative 1 to 1. so that means that we really don't have a derivative value at this point so it's not differentiable so we don't know what this is at x equals 0. we can't really see that the derivative of zero is zero we know that it is but looking at the graph we don't have a slope of zero at this point a slope of zero will be a horizontal line and this doesn't look like a horizontal line at x equals zero so we can't really put a number here therefore we could say that it's not differentiable at x equals zero because we don't have a derivative value at that point and we can see that f prime of x it's not continuous at x equals zero so differentiability describes the continuity of the first derivative function now what i like to do at this point is give you some practice problems consider the piecewise function f of x which is x squared when x is less than zero and x plus two when x is equal to or greater than zero is the function continuous at x equals zero and is it differentiable at x equals zero so how can we find the answer to that question feel free to pause the video and try so let's talk about the continuity first in order for a function to be continuous we need to make sure that the left side and the right side of limits are equal to each other at 0. so what is the limit as x approaches zero from the left to the left of zero we need to use this portion of the piecewise function so that's gonna be zero squared and that's zero now what about the right side of zero the limit as x approaches zero from the right so we need to use this part of the function and so it's going to be zero plus two which is two so notice that the left side and the right side they don't equal to each other which means that the limit as x approaches 0 from either side it does not exist so if the limit doesn't exist you don't have a continuous function and if the function is not continuous at x equals zero it's automatically not differentiable at x equals zero now let's go ahead and graph the piecewise function so we could see that the function is clearly not continuous at x equals zero so i'm going to graph these two separately at first so y equals x squared is a parabola that opens upward and so it looks like this and y equals x plus two it's a linear function so it's a straight line the y-intercept is 2 and the slope is 1. so we have the point 0 2 and with a slope of 1 there's a 1 in front of the x you need to go one to the right and then up one to get the next point so the next point is going to be at 1 3 and then 2 4 and so we have this straight line now to put these two together we need to use x squared only for the left side of zero so we're gonna use just this portion of the graph and then we're gonna use the right side of this graph now let's focus on this graph x squared so x is less than zero which means that we're going to have an open circle at zero and then it's going to go towards the right like that and then here we have a closed circle because it includes zero so if we plug in zero into x plus two you're going to get two so let's say two is over here and then it's going to go up with a slope of one so it's going to go up at a 45 degree angle and as you can see it's clearly not a continuous function we have a jump discontinuity at x equals zero so if the y values are not the same it will not be continuous so a quick test for continuity is to plug in these values into these functions so if you plug in zero into x squared you're gonna get zero if you plug in zero here you're gonna get two because the y values are different at this x value it will not be a continuous function now let's talk about differentiability so we know that if it's not continuous it's not differentiable and looking at the slopes you can see the slopes are clearly different the slope for this graph is 1 and the slope at this region this is it looks like a horizontal tangent so the slope is zero if the slopes are not the same it's not going to be differentiable so we don't have to find the first derivative because if it's not continuous it's automatically not differentiable now let's move on to our next example so let's say that f of x is equal to x when x is less than or equal to one and it's equal to x cubed when x is greater than one so let's determine the continuity of this piecewise function first so let's evaluate the limit as x approaches one from the left side so we need to use x so if we plug in one into x that's going to be just one and then for the right side we need to use x cubed so that's going to be one to the third power which is one so notice that the left side and the right side of limits they're the same so that tells us that the limit as x approaches one from either side exists it's equal to one now we need to make sure the function is defined at one because if these two limits exist and if the function is equal to a value other than one you can get this situation you can get a hole with a point above the hole or below the hole and that would be a removable discontinuity but this is a good first step for the functions being continuous so what is the value of f of one x is equal to one in this region because this is less than or equal to one so that's just going to be one so we can say that the limit as x approaches one of f of x is equal to f of one this is the three-step continuity test so we could say that the function is indeed continuous at x equals one so what about the differentiability of the function is the first derivative continuous at x equals one we have to find out it may or may not be continuous so let's determine if it is so let's start with f prime of x and the derivative of x is one and the derivative of x cube using the power rule is three x squared so what is the limit as x approaches one on the left side for f prime of x so we need to use this and so that's equal to one and the limit as x approaches 1 from the right for f prime of x we need to use 3x squared so that's going to be 3 times 1 squared which is 3. so notice that the left sided limit and the right side limit are not the same so therefore that tells us that the first derivative is not continuous at x equals one which means that f of x the original function is not differentiable at x equals one so let's summarize what we have for this problem the original function is continuous at x equals one but the original function is not differentiable at x equals one because the first derivative f prime of x is not continuous at x equals 1. so keep this in mind differentiability describes the continuity of the first derivative now let's go ahead and graph the piecewise function so we could see the answer visually so on the right side we have the graph of x cubed so when x is one y is one and so this graph is just gonna increase like that if you were to draw the whole graph it would look something like this so we only need this portion of the graph let me draw that better it's just going to go up now this graph y equals x is just a straight line at a 45 degree angle well that really doesn't look like a 45 degree angle so let me do that again so it looks something like that now when x is one y is one so we don't need an open circle at this point so as you can see the graph is continuous there's no disconnects there's no jump discontinuities or holes in this graph so the function f of x is continuous everywhere in this uh graph now looking at the first derivative it's not technically smooth my drawing doesn't show it too well so i'm gonna draw it better i think you could see the sharp turn it's not really smooth at this point so the slope of this line is one and a slope of this curve just beyond one is approximately three so the slope changes from 1 and then it instantly changes to a higher value 3. so it's not really smooth at this point and you could see it better if you use a graphing calculator to graph this piecewise function but graphing it by hand you can see that the slope changes abruptly at one it's not a smooth transition which means that f of x is not differentiable at x equals one now let's move on to our next example so let's say that f of x is x squared minus three when x is less than two and it's four x minus seven when x is equal to or greater than two so is the function continuous at x equals two well let's find out so let's evaluate the limit as x approaches 2 from the left so we need to use this part of the piecewise function so it's going to be 2 squared minus 3 so that's 4 minus 3 which is the one so this is the three-step continuity test now let's evaluate the limit on the right side of two so we have to use four x minus seven so that's gonna be four times two minus seven four times two is eight eight minus seven is one so the left sided and the right side of limits are the same so therefore the limit exists the limit as x approaches two from either side of f of x is going to be 1 as well now we need to make sure the function is defined so let's determine f of 2. so x equals 2 in this part of the function so that's going to be 4 times 2 minus 7 which is 1 as well so we can say that the limit as x approaches 2 of f of x is indeed equal to f of 2. now once you make this statement you've completed the three-step continuity test so we could say that the function is continuous at x equals two now is the function differentiable at x equals 2 so let's begin by finding the first derivative f prime of x so the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of the constant negative 3 is 0. the derivative of 4x is 4. so in order to determine if f of x is differentiable we need to analyze the continuity of the first derivative so we're going to use the three-step continuity test on the first derivative function so the limit as x approaches 2 from the left side of f prime of x that's 2 times 2 which is 4. and the limit as x approaches 2 from the right side of f prime of x it's simply 4. so because these two are the same the limit exists so the limit as x approaches 2 from either side of f prime of x is 4. now we need to make sure that f prime of x is defined at 2. so we have to use this part of the piecewise function that's 4 as well and so we can make the statement that the limit as x approaches 2 for f prime of x is indeed equal to f prime of 2. so what this tells us is that the first derivative f prime of x is continuous at x equals two which means the original function f of x is differentiable at x equals two now as we said before differentiability describes the continuity of the first derivative so now let's graph the piecewise function let's graph each part separately and then we can combine it into a single graph so we have x squared minus three so the graph is going to be shifted down three units and it's going to open in the upward direction now for the second one it's four x minus seven so it's going to start at negative seven and then the slope is four so as we travel one to the right it's going to go up to it's going to go up 4. so the first point is going to be at 0 negative 7 and then it's going to be 1 negative 3 and then 2 1. and so this graph is going to look like this so we need to combine these two into a single graph so we're going to use this graph up to x equals 2 and then this graph beyond x equals 2. so let's start with this one if we plug in 2 it's going to be 2 squared minus 3 so that's 1. now keep in mind it connects that 2 so i don't need to put an open circle because if i plug in 2 here it will give me 1 as well now if we plug in zero we're going to get negative three this should be two one i put the wrong point and if i were to plug in one it'll be one minus three which is negative two and there's going to be symmetry at x equals zero so this graph is going to look something like this now this one is going to be a straight line so the next point if we plug in 2 i mean if you plug in three it's gonna be four times three which is twelve minus seven that's five so it's gonna be up here so i'm gonna draw that in blue now we can see that the function is continuous everywhere my graph is not perfect but there's no holes or discontinuities in this graph now looking at this point x equals two notice that there's a smooth transition between the red line and the blue line because it's smooth that means that it's differentiable at x equals two so the slope for that part of the piecewise function the derivative was 2x if you plug in 2 that gives you a slope of 4. and the derivative of this is just 4. so to the left of this point like if you go just a little to the left the slope is 4 and a little to the right the slope is 4. so at this point the derivative value at x equals 2 is 4. so because the first derivative is continuous the function is differentiable at x equals two so i hope these examples help you to understand the difference between continuity and differentiability continuity is for f of x it determines if f of x is continuous differentiability tells you if f prime of x is continuous or not so make sure you understand that concept now there are some other functions that you need to be familiar with and that's x to the one third and x to the two thirds now even though they're different there's some similarities between these two graphs x to the one third looks like this and then if we graph x to the two thirds this side looks similar and this side is going to be flipped over the x axis because of the square part of x to the two thirds it's going to be an even function it's going to be symmetrical you could think of this as x to the one third squared or the cube root of x and then squared so that's an even function now for both of these functions they're continuous but they're not differentiable at x equals zero now this graph looks smooth however at zero it has a vertical tangent when you get very close to zero my graph is not perfect but it should look more like this so at the center you have a vertical tangent now you know that the slope of a horizontal line is basically zero now what about the slope of a vertical line it's something over zero let's use one to keep things simple so if you have one over zero it's undefined and when you have an undefined slope typically you have a vertical tangent and so it's not differentiable at that point because you don't have a derivative value at that point even though this looks smooth when you have a vertical tangent it tells you that it may not be differentiable at that point now looking at this graph the slope changes from a negative value to a positive value almost instantaneously at this point here the function is going down so the slope is negative and then the function is going up so the slope is positive and so it's not going to be differentiable because we have a sharp turn and at the same time if you look at this curve it's turning into a vertical tangent and the same is true for the right side it looks like a vertical tangent now the fact that it's not differentiable at this point tells us that the first derivative is not continuous now what type of discontinuity are we dealing with in the first derivative when you see a vertical tangent think of a vertical asymptote when the function has a vertical asymptote you have an infinite discontinuity so if you see a vertical tangent that tells us that the first derivative has a vertical asymptote at that point and let's show that so let's start with this function f of x is equal to x to the one third and let's find the first derivative so using the power rule it's going to be one-third and then x one over three minus one that's one over three minus three over three which is negative two over three and so you can rewrite it like this if you bring the x to the denominator it's going to change from negative two-thirds to positive two-thirds and we can put the three in the bottom so notice that x is in the bottom of the fraction and so that tells us that x cannot equal zero for the first derivative function but for the original function it can zero to the one third is just zero and so that's why it's continuous at zero but for the first derivative if we plug in zero it's going to be one over three times zero and that is undefined so if you were to graph this there would be a vertical asymptote at x equals zero so for this type of function it's continuous everywhere but it's not differentiable at x equals zero because for the graph of f of x there's a vertical tangent and for the graph of f prime of x there's a vertical asymptote which means it has an infinite discontinuity and so it's discontinuous at x equals zero remember the differentiability of f of x describes the continuity of f prime of x so if f prime of x is not continuous at a certain point f of x is not differentiable at that point now let's look at the other example f of x is equal to x raised to the 2 over 3. so using the power rule it's going to be 2 over 3 x 2 3 minus one is negative one-third so once again x will be in the denominator so therefore x cannot equal to zero if we were to graph it there's gonna be a vertical asymptote at zero which means that f prime of x is not continuous at x equals zero which means that f of x is not differentiable at x equals zero so anytime you see some sort of vertical tangent there's a good chance that it will not be differentiable at the center of that vertical tangent you 

Transcript for: How To Find The Limit of a Composite Function Given Two Graphs
in this video we're going to talk about how to evaluate the limit of a composite function from a graph so let's start with this expression we want to find the limit as X approaches negative three of f of G of x so this expression is equivalent to what I'm about to write here so we have f and then we're going to take the limit as X approaches negative 3 of the function G of x so G of X is the graph on the right side and here is an x value of negative three if we approach from the left side notice that g will gain a y value of the negative 2. and the same is true if we approach from the right side so from either side it's going to be negative 2. so this is going to equal the limit as G of x approaches negative two for the expression f of G of x so as X approaches negative three G approaches negative two now this part you need to be careful with here's a question for you there's G of X does it approach negative two from the left side or from the right side think about that that's very important so as X approaches negative three from the left side we know G approaches negative two now G is on the y axis so the G function it's approaching this y value of negative two from above this point and as we approach negative three from the right side G is approaching negative two from above negative two as well as G approaches negative two from above in this graph it's equivalent to F approaching negative two from the right side so you need to translate the word above in the G function with the word from the right in the function for f because the Y value for this function will become the x value for this function because G is inside of f you may want to take a minute to make sure you internalize that and you could visualize it as well with a number line which I'm going to put here so here is negative 2 and we're focused on the Y values as we approach from this side the Y values they're decreasing here the Y value is zero it's negative one negative 1.5 negative 1.9 negative 2. so it's greater than negative 2. from here if we go from this side it's 0 negative 1 negative 1.5 negative 1.9 and negative 2. so this side is negative 2.1 Which is less than negative 2 over here this is negative 1.9 which is greater than negative 2. so as we go towards negative 2 we need to hit negative 1.9 before we get to negative 2. we're not going to get to negative 2.1 which means we're coming from this side from negative 1.9 to negative 2. so as we approach negative 2 from above in the case of G that equates to approach a negative 2 from the right along the x-axis in the graph of F and that's the concept I want you to understand here so feel free to rewind the video if you need to to make sure you grasp that concept because that's important and when dealing with the limit of composite functions so now that we know we are approaching that g is approaching negative two from the right now that we move on to the graph of f we need to look at the x value of negative two and we need to approach it from the right fortunately if we approach it from the left or the right we're going to get the same y value for f which is positive 3. so that's going to be the answer to this problem the end result is a value of 3. now let's move on to the next example so let's try this one let's find the limit as X approaches negative one of f of G of x so feel free to work on that example problem so here is negative one on G but first let's write it this way so this is equivalent to f and then we're going to take the limit as X approaches negative one of G of x now let's make sure that the limit exists as we approach negative one from the left side the Y value is four and as we approach negative one from the right side we still get a y value of 4. so as X approaches negative one G approaches 4. so I'm going to write the limit as G of x approaches four of the function f of G of x g is still inside of f now as we approach 4 or as we approach an x value of negative one and as the Y value approaches 4. is G going to four from the left or four from from the right what would you say in the last problem we were approaching negative two some above so that's where looking at the Y values not the X values here we're approaching the Y value of 4 from Below so when you approach a y value from above it's going to be associated with a positive sign or from the right when you approach a y value From Below it's going to be associated with a negative sign or from the left and that's what we have here so because we're approaching the Y value of 4 and below when we move on to the next graph G is going to approach 4 on the left side and let's use the number line to verify this so let's put 4 because that's the Y value we're approaching to the right of positive four will be 4.1 to the left will be 3.9 so notice that we're going up so here the Y value is 2 2.53 3.5 3.94 . so we're coming from the left we're not going above 4 to 4.1 we'll start from 3 to 3.5 to 3.9 to 4. so that's why we could put the negative sign here because we're approaching 4 from the left side or from below it though G of X will be the input of f so this is going to be the x value for the F function so here we're approaching 4 not from the right but from the left so as we approach an x value of 4 from the left the Y value is going to be two if we were to approach positive 4 from the right side the Y value will be 1. so in this case in order to get this question right we need to choose the appropriate sign here we need to know if we're going from we're going to 4 from the right or 4 to the left because that will affect the final answer in this example go ahead and try this problem find the limit as X approaches 2 of f of G of x now feel free to pause the video if you want to work on this example Problem by the way for those of you who want more the practice problems on limits in general maybe have a test to study for check out the links in the description section below I'm going to be posting more content on limits so that you can pass your next exam so feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance so first we're going to rewrite this expression as f of the limit as X approaches 2 of G of x so here is an x value of 2. now for this one you need to be careful because it's a little different than the previous problems and here's why if we focus on the Y values here we're approaching a y value of negative two from above and here we're approaching a y value of negative 2 from above so it's the same for that now for the 4 for the second problem we approach a y value of 4 from above and on the right side we approach a y value of 4 from above as well so that's the same so this one is different because as we approach the x value of 2 the Y value that corresponds to G is one but notice that we're approaching the Y value of 1 from above on one side but on the other side we're approaching a y value of one from or below so because those directions are different in terms of the Y value not the X what's going to happen is it's going to give us two different values for G once we're trying to get F from G so we're going to have to break this problem into two parts we need to determine the left side limit and the right side limit because they will give us different values of G so let's find F of the limit as X approaches 2 from the right of G of x so here is the x value of 2. it's right here and we're going to approach it from the right side so as we approach 2 from the right side we get a y value of one but notice we are approaching the Y value of one from below it's from the right but it's from Below so we're approaching along x axis from the right but we're going we're approaching a y value of one from Below us so what's going to happen is we're going to get the limit as a g approaches positive one now because we're approaching the Y value From Below this is going to be from the left side when we translate it to the next graph because as the Y values increase towards one we need to go from 0 to 0.5 to 1 so we're going from the left side of one so that's how we have the negative sign and not the positive sign and this is going to be of f of G of x so now that we have that let's take this value and move it along the x-axis of the function for f so 1 is basically this vertical asymptote here as we approach one from the left we're following this part of the curve notice that it's going up to positive Infinity now let's check the other side so let's find F of the limit as X approaches 2 from the left of G of x so as we approach the x value of 2 for the function of G and we're doing it from the left side we're going to get the limit as G of x it's still approaching a positive value of one but notice that we're coming from above so as we approach the Y value of one from above when we translate it to f of x it's going to be the same as approaching this from the right side because you're going 2 1 from higher values so here the Y value is 2 and it's 1.5 1.1 and then one so we're going if on a number line from the right of 1. so let's put a plus there I was trying to get rid of this Arrow but I guess it's just gonna have to stay now but now as we plug in this into F at G of X approaches one so we have F of one that's on the right so as we follow this to an x value of one the curve is going towards negative Infinity now because the right sided limit and the left-sided limit are different the original limit does not exist because they're different so that's it for a problem now let's work on one more example what is the limit as X approaches 3 from the left side of f of G of x feel free to try that so here is an x value of 3. and we're approaching it from the left side and that will give us a y value of negative one so this is f of the limit as X approaches 3 from the left of G of x and as we approach 3 from the left G goes to negative one so I'm just going to continue this here so we have the limit as G goes to negative one of f of G of x now as G approaches negative one from the left side or from the right side so looking at the Y values the curve is approaching negative one from above so that means that we're approaching negative one from the right side along the number line so now we move on to the graph of f as G approaches negative one from the right or in other words that's X approaches negative one from the right notice that we now we have two curves at negative one we have this one and this one and this one is on the left side this one is on the right side so we got to start from this curve and we go towards negative one which will give us a y value of four so that's going to be the answer for this problem so that's basically it for this video hopefully it gave you a good introduction in terms of how to evaluate limits of composite functions so they could be tricky but one thing I recommend is to pay attention to this part once you get the value for G like where it's going make sure you determine if it's approaching that value from the left side or from the right side if it approaches negative one from below or above because if you're not careful with that all right you could make some mistakes and that can cost you and getting the right answers so be careful with that part 

Transcript for: How To Find The Limit of a Composite Function - Calculus
in this lesson we're going to talk about how to find the limit of a composite function so for the first example we have the inner function X over 3 and the outer function PSI so we're going to evaluate this limit and for this problem we could use direct substitution so we can write sine and we could put the limit on the inside the limit as X approaches pi of the expression X over 3. using direct substitution we could replace x with pi so this becomes sine I over 3. now Pi is equal to 180 degrees if you divide that by 3 that becomes 60. so this is equivalent to sine of 60 degrees which is equal to the square root of 3 over 2. so that's all we need to do for the first example now for the next example we have another composite function and so what we can do is write it like this we have the natural log of the limit as X approaches zero of cosine of x now cosine of zero we know it's 1. and as you approach Zero from the right side or zero from the left side it will still be one cosine of positive point zero one is approximately positive one and cosine of negative point zero one if you type in your calculator that's still approximately positive one so using direct substitution we get that cosine of zero is one and we know the natural log of one is zero now let's work on another example let's say we have the limit as X approach is zero but it's going to be from the right side and this is going to be of the natural log of x cosine gets now this one is going to be a little bit more trickier than the last one but still doable so feel free to pause the video and try this example now for this problem what I'd like to do is set y equal to the inner function so I'm going to make y equal to x cosine X now in order to evaluate the limit as X approaches 0 from the right of the inside function it's helpful to know what these values are independent of each other so the limit as X approaches 0 of X that's going to be zero so specifically zero to the right and the limit as X approaches Zero from the right of cosine that's going to be 1. so sine of 0 is 1. now if we put these two together zero to the right times one we get x cosine X well this is going to be zero so specifically zero to the right meaning it's going to approach zero from the right side so it's going to be approximately it's going to be above zero but getting closer to zero so it's not going to be less than zero it's going to be above it if it was less than zero it would be approaching Zero from the left we don't have that so what I'm going to do is I'm going to say this we have the limit as well of Ln I'm going to replace this with y now as X approaches 0 from the right x cosine X which is y and that is going to approach a zero from the right so what I'm going to have here is as y approaches 0 from the right because that's what we have here as X approaches 0 from the right we get that y approaches 0 from the right so now we have to apply that to the outer function Ln now we know that Ln 1 is equal to zero and Ln 0 does not exist it's like undefined but what about Ln as we approach Zero from the right as we approach 0 from the right this is going to be negative Infinity if you have your calculator with you if you were to type in Ln of a small number but just above zero or to the right of zero so Ln point zero one this will give you negative 4.6 now if we were to type in Ln 1 times 10 to the negative 30 . so that's still above zero but very close to zero you would get Negative 69. so as you can see as you get closer and closer to zero it's becoming more negative so this is going to be the final answer it's a negative Infinity now let's work on another example what is the limit as X approaches pi over 2. of this composite function e raised to the tangent X feel free to try that one so for this problem I'm going to make y equal the tangent now notice that this is not from the right or from the left side and for this one for tangent it matters because tangent 90 it's undefined and the left side and the right side they have different values if we were to take the limit as X approaches pi over 2 which is 90 degrees from the right side we would get a different value and this is for tangent X we would get a different value compared to if we were to take the limit as X approaches pi over 2 from the left side and to confirm this if you were to type in tan 90 in your calculator it will be undefined foreign if you were to plug in 1091 you would get Negative 57.2 91 is in quadrant two and tangent is negative in quadrant two but if we were to plug in 10 89 degrees you would get positive so these 7.2 because it's positive in quadrant one if we were to create a number line 91 would be equivalent to PI over 2 approaching from the right side 89 will be equivalent to PI over 2 but approach to the left so the limit as X approaches pi over 2 from the right side AKA 1091 that's going to give us negative Infinity and the limit as X approaches pi over 2 from the left side of tangent X AKA tan 89 that's going to give us positive Infinity so that's what we want to understand from this so what we're going to have is the limit as y approaches we're gonna have to figure out what goes here and I'm going to replace tangent with y so the limit as X approaches pi over 2 for tangent accurate notice that it's different so what this means is I'm going to have to break this problem into two parts so let's start with this one let's see what it is as we approach from the right this is going to be e to the Y so as X approaches pi over 2 from the right tangent X will become negative Infinity so in other words y approaches negative Infinity since Y is defined to be tangent X now what is the limit as y approaches negative infinity or e to the Y so this is going to be e to the negative Infinity which is the same as 1 over e to the infinity e to the infinity is infinity and one over infinity is zero whenever you divide a constant by a very large number you're going to get a smaller number so this is going to go to zero so that's the value for the right sided limit now let's check the value for the left-sided limit so we can get rid of this so the limit as X approaches pi over 2 from the left of e tangent X says X approaches pi over 2 from the left tangent is going to go to positive Infinity so we could say that we have the limit as y goes to positive Infinity of e and we'll replace tangent with y so this becomes e to the infinity which is infinity now notice that the right sided limit and the left side limit as two different values they're not the same because they don't equal to each other because they're not equal to each other the limit does not exist so this is going to be the answer so sometimes you have to be careful when you don't have a one-sided limit you need to track to see if the right side limit and the left side limit if they lead to the same value so that's basically it for this video by the way for those of you who want more videos on evaluated limits feel free to check out the links in the description section below 

Transcript for: Limits and Continuity
now let's start the video quiz for each of these problems pause the video and work on it once you have your answer unpause it to see the solution so let's go ahead and begin for number one if we plug in 2 notice that we will get 4 in the bottom we won't get a 0 in the denominator of the fraction so therefore we can use direct substitution to get the answer so let's replace x with 2 so it's going to be 2 squared plus 7 times 2 plus 6 divided by 2 plus 2. now 2 squared is 4 7 times 2 is 14 plus 6 and 2 plus 2 is 4. now 4 14 plus 6 is 20 and 20 plus 4 that's 24 and 24 divided by that number was supposed to be 4. 24 divided by 4 is 6. so this is the value of the limit which means that answer choice b is the correct answer number two find the value of the limit shown below now if we try to use direct substitution in the denominator we're going to get a zero so we don't want to do that what we need to do is factor so how can we factor the numerator what two numbers multiply to negative 15 but add to the middle coefficient of positive two this is going to be positive five and negative three so to factor it's gonna be x plus five times x minus three now on the bottom we can factor x squared minus nine because they're perfect squares the square root of x squared is x and the square root of nine is three one of them is going to be plus the other is going to be minus notice that we can cancel x minus 3. so now we can evaluate the limit as x approaches 3 of x plus 5 divided by x plus three so it's going to be three plus five divided by three plus three and so that's eight divided by six which reduces to four divided by three if you divide both numbers by two so therefore d is the right answer number three calculate the value of the limit shown below so whenever you have a complex fraction what you want to do is multiply the top and the bottom by the common denominator the common denominator being 4x so on the top you want to distribute 4x times one over x is four four x is the same as four x over one and you can see the x variables will cancel leaving behind four so therefore we now have is the limit as x approaches four and on top we have positive four now if we multiply four x by one over four you can see that the fours will cancel leaving behind x and there's a negative sign in front so it's going to be minus x and on the bottom we're just going to rewrite x minus 4 and 4 minus x now these two factors look very similar but they're not exactly the same so what we're going to do is we're going to factor out a negative 1. if we do so negative x will change into positive x and positive 4 will change into negative 4. and it's at this point that we can get rid of the x minus four so now we have the limit as x approaches four of negative one divided by four x now we can use direct substitution so this is going to be negative 1 over 4 times 4 which gives us a final answer of negative 1 divided by 16 which means c is the right answer number four find the value of the limit so here we have a rational function with a square root on the top in a situation like this you need to multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate of the numerator the conjugate is going to be the same thing but you got to change the negative sign into a positive sign and whatever you do to the top you must also do to the bottom now on top we're going to foil the square root of x times the square root of x is equal to x the square root of x times 4 that's going to be positive 4 square root x and negative 4 times the square root of x is going to be what you see here and finally we have negative 4 times 4 which is negative 16. in the denominator we're not going to foil we're just going to rewrite what we have so we can see that the two middle terms add up to zero and they're going to disappear so now what we have is the limit as x approaches 16 of x minus 16 divided by x minus 16 times the square root of x plus four so now we can cancel x minus sixteen and at this point we can replace x with sixteen so this is going to be one divided by the square root of sixteen plus four the square root of sixteen is four and four plus four is eight so the answer is one divided by eight which corresponds to answer choice a number five evaluate the limit so we can't plug in seven if we plug in seven it's gonna be zero over zero which is indeterminate and we don't know if that's equal to zero infinity doesn't exist or one or negative one so we need to check the left side and the right sided limit so let's start with the left side as x approaches seven from the left let's call this f of x so we're going to substitute a number that's close to 7 but from the left let's use 6.9 6.9 minus 7 is negative point one and the absolute value of negative point one is positive point one and when you divide that by negative point one you're going to get negative one so therefore that is the limit as x approaches seven from the left side it's equal to negative one now what about from the right side what is the limit as x approaches seven from the right side so let's plug in a number that's greater than 7 but close to it let's try 7.1 so 7.1 minus 7 is equal to positive 0.1 and the absolute value of positive 0.1 is positive 0.1 divided by itself that's going to equal positive 1. so notice that the left side and the right side do not match so therefore the limit does not exist which means e is the answer number six what is the value of the limit of the trigonometric function shown below just by looking at it it's going to be 3 divided by 5 for those of you who just want a quick answer so it turns out answer choice b is the right answer but let's do some work to get our answer so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to replace tangent with sine divided by cosine so tan 3x is sine 3x divided by cosine 3x and we still have this 5x on the bottom so i can write it as 1 over 5x now what i need to have under sine 3x is a 3x i'm going to multiply the top and the bottom by 3. so i'm going to trade places with the cosine and the 3 i'm also going to move the x in that position as well so this is all equal to the limit as x approaches 0 sine three x divided by three x times the limit as x approaches zero i still have a three on top and already move the 3x to the left so on the bottom i have a 5 and a cosine 3x which i'm going to write as 1 over cosine 3x so now i'm going to use substitution let's say that y is equal to 3x so therefore this limit expression becomes the following expression the limit as y approaches 0 of sine y divided by y times the limit as x approaches zero and here this is a function based on x so this is gonna be one over cosine three x times three over five now the limit as y approaches zero of sine y divided by y that's equal to one you just need to know that formula you can always plug in a small value of x and you can confirm that as one cosine zero if we replace x with zero three times zero is still zero cosine zero is equal to one but i'll replace that in the next step so what we have is one times one times three over five which gives us a final answer of three divided by five so therefore answer choice b is the right answer number seven find the horizontal asymptote of the function shown below using limits to do so we need to find the limit as x approaches infinity of the function 5x plus 8x squared divided by three x plus two x squared plus five now keep in mind when x becomes very large five x is insignificant compared to eight x squared if you replace x with a thousand five thousand is not significant to eight million and three is not significant to two million so therefore this expression becomes equivalent to the limit as x approaches infinity of eight x squared divided by two x squared plus five you can only do this when x becomes very large mathematically it works out eight divided by two is four and you can cancel the x squares because they're the same so what we now have is four plus five which is equal to nine so therefore nine is the final answer and that's going to be the horizontal asymptote it's an equation and y equals nine so e is the right answer number eight which the following is equivalent to the limit shown below so go ahead and take a minute and try this problem now we need to know is that the sine function oscillates between one and negative one this is the graph of sine x now the only difference between sine x and sine one over x is how fast it oscillates as you approach an x value of zero it begins to oscillate faster and faster however the amplitude still varies between one and negative one so it really doesn't matter the angle or the fact that we have a one over x within sine because as x approaches zero one over x does not exist as x approaches zero from the left 1 over x becomes negative infinity and as x approaches 0 from the right 1 over x becomes positive infinity but that doesn't matter for the sine function because it's always going to alternate between negative 1 and 1. so we can make this statement sine of one over x will always be between negative one and one now if we multiply everything by x we can get this expression negative x is between sine is between x sine one over x and it's between positive x so x sine 1 over x is between negative x and positive x that's what i meant to say now what we can use is the squeeze term so basically the squeeze term states that let's call this h of x and let's say f of x is between h of x and g of x if the limit as x approaches zero of h of x and g of x if they're the same then the limit as x approaches f of x must also be the same so that's the main idea behind the squeeze term so the limit as x approaches zero for h of x which is really negative x well that's equal to zero now the limit as x approaches zero of g of x which in this case is positive x that two is equal to zero so therefore the limit as x approaches x sine of one over x since it's between negative x and x it too must also equal zero so therefore b is the right answer according to the squeeze term number nine verify that the intermediate value theorem applies to the indicated interval and find the value of c guaranteed by the theorem so based on the intermediate value theorem you need to know that it states that f has to be continuous on the closed interval a to b and that f of a cannot equal f of b and there is some number k which is between f of a and f b such that f c is equal to k and c has to be in the interval of a and b so we got to find that value of c such that k is between f and f b notice that we have the value of k k is whatever number f c is equal to so therefore k is zero so first we've got to show that f of a and f of b well we have to show that zero is between f and f b we have to prove that the ivt term applies so let's find f of a where a is zero and b is two so f of zero is going to be zero squared plus four times zero minus five so f of zero is negative five now let's calculate f of b which is f of two so that's gonna be two squared plus four times two minus five two squared is four four times two is eight four plus eight is twelve minus five that's seven so the intermediate value theorem does apply to the indicated interval as we can see k which is zero is in between negative five and seven so now that we know that the ivt theorem applies we can now find the value of c so let's set f of c equal to zero so basically set the function f of x replace it with zero and find the value of x so zero is equal to x squared plus four x minus five now we need to factor two numbers that multiply to negative five but add to positive four are positive five and negative one therefore we can see that x is equal to negative five and positive one if you reverse the signs if you set x plus five equal to zero x will equal negative five and if you set x minus one equal to zero x will equal positive one now one of these values is the c value that we're looking for so c has to be in the interval a to b that is between zero and two negative five is not between zero and 2 but 1 is so therefore c is equal to 1 which means d is the right answer number 10 find the value of c that will make the function continuous at x equals two the first thing we need to do is set these two functions equal to each other so seven x squared plus c x is equal to two x cubed plus five c plus three now we need to find the value of c when x is two so let's replace x with two and then after that all we have to do is just algebra two squared is four four times seven is twenty-eight two to the third is eight times two is sixteen so now let's subtract both sides by 2c so these will cancel on the left we have 28 and we can combine like terms 16 plus 3 is 19. and 5c minus 2c is 3c now let's subtract both sides by 19. 28 minus 19 is 9. so 9 is equal to 3c so if we divide both sides by 3 we can see that c is nine divided by three which is three and that is the answer so answer choice c is correct 

Transcript for: The Power Rule For Derivatives
in this video we're going to focus on the power rule for derivatives so let's say if we have some function f of x and it's equal to a variable raised to a constant x raised to n so x is the variable n is the constant what is the first derivative of that function according to the power rule it's going to equal n times x raised to the n minus one so let's say for example if f of x is equal to x squared then the first derivative we're going to take this constant move it to the front so it's going to be 2 and then times x raised to the 2 minus 1. so notice that in this example n is 2. so we have a 2 here and a 2 minus one on top two minus one is one so we get two times x to the first power or simply two x now let's try another example let's say if f of x is equal to x cubed what's f prime of x using the power rule so in this case n is three so it's going to be three x to the three minus one which three minus one is two so it's three x squared now for the sake of practice go ahead and try these so d dx simply means that you're differentiating x to the fourth with respect to x feel free to pause the video as you work on these examples i want you to master this topic that's why i'm giving you so many examples so using the power rule which is n times x raised to the n minus 1 this is going to be 4 x raised to the 4 minus 1 which is 4x to the third power so that's the answer for the first one what about the other ones so n is 5 for this example so it's going to be 5 x raised to the 5 minus 1 5 minus 1 is 4 so it's 5x to the fourth power here n is 6 so it's going to be 6 x to the 6 minus 1. and so that's going to be 6x to the fifth power and the last one n is seven so it's going to be seven x raised to the seven minus one and seven minus one is six so it's seven x to the sixth power and so that's how you can use the power rule to differentiate monomials now what about this one what is the derivative of x feel free to pause the video and think about that use the power rule to get the answer now what is n in this example well keep in mind what we have is x raised to the first power so therefore n is equal to one so this is going to be one x to the one minus one one minus one is zero and what is x to the zero anything raised to the zero power is one so this is going to be one times one which is simply one so the derivative of x is one now what about the derivative of a constant like four what's the answer now if you saw a previous video in my calculus playlist that is the constant rule for derivatives you know that the derivative of any constant is zero but how can we show this using the power rule well first we need to rewrite this expression four is the same as four x to the zero because x to the zero is one and four times one is four so these two expressions are equivalent to each other now we can use the power rule on x to the zero so in this case n is zero so we're gonna have four multiplied by zero x to the zero minus one now zero times anything is zero so the whole thing is equal to zero and that's one way we can show that the derivative of a constant is equal to zero using the power rule now sometimes you may need to differentiate rational functions how can we use the power rule to differentiate 1 over x what is the derivative of one over x what do you think we need to do here if you get a rational function which is basically a fraction rewrite the expression that's the first thing you need to do so take the x variable and move it to the top so this is going to be x raised to the negative one so you need to be familiar with properties of exponents for example if we had one over x to the fourth this is the same as x to the negative fourth if you move it to the top whenever you move a variable from the bottom to the top the sign of the exponent changes so it changes from positive four to negative four so in our example we had one over x which is the same as one over x raised to the positive one so as we move the variable from the bottom to the top it now has a negative exponent instead of a positive exponent so keep that in mind now we can use the power rule because it's in the form x raised to the n and we know that the derivative of x raised to the n is n x raised to the n minus one so in this example n is equal to negative one so this expression here that's going to equal negative one x to the negative one minus one so that is negative one and negative one minus one is negative two so the derivative of one over x is negative one x to the negative two now you can simplify this expression because most often the final answer is not going to have a negative exponent so what we need to do is take the x variable and bring it back down to the denominator of the fraction so the negative 1 will stay on top so we're gonna have negative one but on the bottom x to the positive two so the derivative of one over x is negative one over x squared and that's it now let's try another example let's say if f of x is one over x squared what is f prime of x use the power rule to get f prime of x so first we need to rewrite the function let's take the variable and move it to the top so we know it's going to be x to the negative 2. and now we could find the first derivative by using the power rule so in this example n is equal to negative two so following this expression f prime of x will be equal to negative two x raised to the negative two minus one so negative two minus one is negative three and once we have this answer which is the first derivative we simply need to simplify it so let's take the x variable and move it to the bottom again so the negative 2 will remain on top and on the bottom we're going to have x cubed so that's the final answer that's the first derivative of one over x squared it's negative two divided by x cubed now let's try one more example with rational functions go ahead and differentiate one over x to the fourth power so let's rewrite the expression first let's take the variable and move it to the top so this is going to be x raised to the negative 4 power and now let's differentiate it using the power rule so the exponent will move to the front so it's going to be negative 4 x and keep in mind n is negative 4 in this example so it's n x raised to the n minus one so to negative four x raised to the negative four minus one and negative four minus one is negative five now we need to rewrite it so let's take the x variable and move it to the denominator of the fraction so the negative 4 will remain on top and on the bottom we're going to have x to the fifth power so it's negative 4 divided by x to the fifth power now let's say if we have a radical function like the square root of x what is the derivative of the square root of x go ahead and try that so using the power rule we need to rewrite it the square root of x is basically x to the one half so there's a one in the exponent of x if you don't see a number it's a one however if you don't see an index number for a square root symbol it's always a two so it's x to the one half let's say if i had the fourth root of x cubed this is x to the three fourths if i have the seventh root of x to the fifth this is going to be x to the five over seven or if i have the sixth root of x to the eleventh this is x to the eleven over six so you could see how you can convert it from radical form to basically an exponent now in this example n is one half so this is going to equal one half x to the n minus one or one half minus one now we need to get common denominators one is the same as two over two and one minus two is negative one so one over two minus two over two is negative one over two so let's rewrite this expression as a single fraction so right now the 1 is at the top and x is also on the top the 2 however is on the bottom but we need to move x to the bottom so it's going to be 1 over 2 x raised to the positive one half now keep in mind x to the one half is the same as the square root of x so we can write the final answer as one over two square root x and so that's the derivative of the square root of x you 

Transcript for: The Constant Multiple Rule For Derivatives
in this lesson we're going to go over the constant multiple rule for derivatives so here's what you need to know the derivative of a constant times the function is equal to the constant times the derivative of the function so all you need to do is find the derivative and multiply it by that constant so let me give an example let's say if we want to differentiate 3x to the fifth power now the constant is three the function of x is x to the fifth now you can differentiate x to the fifth using the power rule so let's rewrite the constant three and let's take the derivative of x to the fifth power if you recall the derivative of a variable raised to a constant like x to the fifth is n times x raised to the n minus one so that's going to be 5 times x raised to the 5 minus 1. now 5 minus 1 is 4 and now we can multiply the 5 by the 3. 3 times 5 is 15. and so this will give us 15 x to the fourth power and that's the answer go ahead and try these examples find the derivative of 4x to the seventh power and also differentiate 5x to the 9th power using the constant multiple rule so the constant is 4. and we need to differentiate x to the seventh power so using the power rule it's going to be seven x raised to the seven minus one 7 minus 1 is 6 and then 4 times 7 is 28 so it's going to be 28 x to the sixth power now for the next example we have a constant of 5 and we need to find the derivative of x to the ninth power so it's going to be nine x raised to the nine minus one and nine minus one is eight and five times nine 9 is 45 so we get 45 x to the a power so that's a simple way in which you can use the constant multiple rule in order to find the derivative of a function now what is the derivative of x divided by seven what do you think we need to do for that particular problem so we have a fraction we have a variable divided by a constant what should we do if you're confused by this problem you don't need to be it's not that hard you just have to see it from a different perspective let's rewrite the expression this expression is equivalent to 1 over 7 times x so now it's very similar to this problem like the first three problems that we did for example if i want to find the derivative of 5x to the seventh power i have a constant times a variable this is just what i have here this is going to be 5 times 7 x raised to the 7 minus 1 and that's 5 times 7 x raised to the 6 5 times 7 is 35 so i'm going to follow the exact process all i need to do in this problem is to separate the x and the seven so the constant is one over seven so this is going to equal the constant times the derivative of the function and this is x to the first power so if we use the power rule it's going to be 1 x raised to the 1 minus 1. 1 minus 1 is 0. so we have x to the 0 power anything raised to the zero power is one so one over seven times one is simply one over seven so that is the derivative of x divided by seven here's another one you could try what is the derivative of x cubed divided by 15. let's go ahead and get the answer for that one so first let's rewrite it so the constant in this example is 1 over 15 and it's multiplied by x cubed so using the constant multiple rule it's going to be 1 over 15 times the derivative of x cubed which is 3 x to the three minus one three minus one is two and so it's going to be three x squared divided by fifteen now keep in mind 15 is 3 times 5 and 3 divided by 3 is 1 so we can cancel the 3. so you can write your final answer as x squared over 5 or you can write it as 1 5 times x squared now what about this example what is the derivative of negative seven x to the sixth divided by four go ahead and try that so let's separate the variable from the constant so the constant is negative seven over four it's a fraction and the variable or the function f of x is x to the sixth power so we're gonna rewrite the constant and differentiate x to the sixth power which is going to be six x to the fifth power six minus one is five negative seven times six is negative 42 so we have negative 42 x to the fifth power divided by four now we could simplify 42 over four 42 is 21 times two and four is two times two so we can cancel a two so the final answer is negative 21 x to the fifth power divided by two now let's apply the constant multiple rule with square root functions so what is the derivative of 4 square root x so we can clearly see that the constant is 4. but we need to rewrite the square root function the square root of x is x raised to the one half and we need to use the power rule on that expression so it's going to be the constant times the derivative of x to the one-half which is going to be one-half x raised to the n minus one or one-half minus one now one-half minus one if you get common denominators one is basically two over two so one over two minus two over two is negative one over two now we can multiply four and a half half of four is two so we have two x to the negative one half now we need to convert the negative exponent into a positive exponent and we can do so if we take the variable x and move it to the bottom so this is equal to two divided by x to the one half now we know that x to one half is basically the square root of x so the final answer is two divided by the square root of x and that's it let's use the constant multiple rule with rational functions so differentiate 5 divided by x now just like the other problem we need to rewrite this expression so i'm going to take the x variable and move it to the top right now it's x to the 1 power on the bottom but it's going to be x to the negative 1 when x is in the numerator so we can see that the constant is 5 f of x is x to the negative 1. so now let's differentiate x to the negative 1 power using the power rule so it's negative 1 x to the negative one minus one and negative one minus one is negative two so five times negative one that's going to be negative five now let's move the variable to the bottom so we can convert the negative exponent into a positive exponent so this is equal to negative 5 over x squared and that is the answer now what about this one what is the derivative of five divided by two and let's say it's the seventh root of x to the fourth go ahead and try that so let's separate the constant from the variable so the constant is five over two and it's multiplied by one over the seventh root of x to the fourth now before we could find the derivative of that expression we need to rewrite it so first let's convert it from radical form to exponential form the seventh root of x to the fourth is x raised to the four over seven now if you need some more examples the ninth root of x to the fifth is x to the five over nine the fourth root of x cubed is x to the three fourths just in case if you have a question about how i got that answer now we need to move the variable to the top so this is going to be 5 over 2 times x raised to the negative 4 over 7. and now we can find the derivative of this expression using the power rule so this is going to be 5 over 2 and then we're going to take the exponent move it to the front so that's going to be negative 4 over 7 times x and then we need to subtract the exponent by one so what's negative four over seven minus one one is the same as seven over seven and negative four minus seven is negative eleven so what we now have is five over two times negative four over seven x to the negative eleven over seven 5 times negative 4 is negative 20 and 2 times 7 is 14. and so this is what we now have now i'm going to convert this back into radical form but first i'm going to take the variable and move it to the bottom right now we have this expression negative 20 x to the negative 11 over 7 divided by 14 but that's equivalent to negative 20 over fourteen x to the positive eleven over seven now twenty is basically ten times two and fourteen is seven times two so we can get rid of a two and at the same time we can convert this back into its radical form where it's the seventh root of x to the eleventh power so the final answer is negative 10 divided by seven and then the seventh root of x to 11. that's it now i'm sure someone is going to ask me if we could simplify this expression further and it turns out that we can so i'm going to go ahead and do that so this is going to be negative 10 over 7 and then i'm going to break down x 11 as x to the seven and x to the four because four plus seven is eleven and i'm going to separate this radical into two radicals so the first one is the seventh root of x to the seventh and the second one is seventh root of x to the fourth now because these two both contain a seven seven divided by 7 is 1. and so the final answer fully simplified is negative 10 divided by 7 times x multiplied by the 7th root of x to the fourth power and that is it if you want to rationalize the expression you can but i don't think it's necessary but if you want to here's what you could do you can multiply the top and the bottom by the center fruit of x cubed if you really want to take it to the next level and so it's going to be negative 10 7 fruit x cubed over 7x x to the fourth times x cubed is x to the seventh power so you have the seventh root of x to the seventh which is about to be simplified into another x so these sevens will cancel and we're going to get another x and so you can also write your answer as negative 10 seventh root of x cubed divided by seven x squared if you're told to rationalize any radicals in the denominator you 

Transcript for: Derivatives of Polynomial Functions | Calculus
in this lesson we're going to go over derivatives of polynomial functions so let's say if we have the function f of x and it's x cubed minus 5 x squared plus seven x minus four so what is the derivative of that function so all you need to do is find the derivative of each term separately so using the power rule the derivative of x cubed is going to be 3x raised to the 3 minus 1 or 3x squared now using the constant multiple rule the derivative of 5x squared is going to be 5 times the derivative of x squared which is 2x to the first power the derivative of x is simply 1 and the derivative of a constant is 0. now 5 times 2x is 10x so this is the answer it's 3x squared minus 10x plus 7. now let's try a similar example so let's say we have four x to the fifth power minus six x cubed plus eight x squared minus nine so feel free to take a minute and find the first derivative of this function so the derivative of x to the fifth using the power rule which is n x raised to the n minus one in this case n is 5 so it's going to be 5 x to the 5 minus 1 or 5 x to the fourth the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of the constant is simply zero so this is going to be four times five which is twenty six times three is eighteen and eight times two is sixteen and so it's twenty x to the fourth power minus 18x squared plus 16x now let's say if we have a function that looks like this let's say it's 7x times 2x minus x cubed how can we find the derivative of this function what would you do if you see an expression like this one go ahead and distribute if we distribute 7x to 2x 7 times 2 is 14 x times x is x squared so we're going to get 14x squared and then if we multiply 7x to negative x cubed that's negative 7 x to the fourth power so now in this form we could find the first derivative the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of x to the fourth is 4x cubed so the final answer is going to be 28x and 7 times 4 is also 28. so 28x minus 28 x to the cube now let's say if f of x is equal to three x plus two squared what's the first derivative of this function now if you're not familiar with the chain rule it's best to expand this expression so we can write it twice since it's squared and we need to foil the expression 3x times 3x is 9x squared and then 3x times 2 is 6x and then we also have 2 times 3x which is also 6x and then 2 times 2 is 4. and then if we combine like terms we can rewrite f of x as 9x squared plus 12x plus 4. so now in this form it's going to be very easy to find the first derivative so if we differentiate x squared it's 2x the derivative of x will always be one and for the constant it's going to be zero so f prime of x is going to be 18x plus 12. and that's the answer let's work on one more problem so let's say that f of x is equal to 4x to the fifth power minus 5x to the fourth power plus 2x to the third all divided by x squared what do you think we need to do for this example the best thing to do is to simplify before finding the first derivative and if you have a polynomial divided by a single term or monomial divide each term of the polynomial by that monomial so when dividing by two monomials you need to subtract the exponents five minus two is three so this is going to be four x to the third power and then four minus two is two so that's five x squared and then 3 minus 2 is 1. so this is going to be 2x so that's f of x in its simplified form so now we can determine f prime of x the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared the derivative of x squared is two x and the derivative of x is one so the final answer is going to be 12 x squared minus 10x plus 2. so now you know how to find the derivative of a polynomial function you 

Transcript for: Definition of the Derivative
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the derivative using the definition of the derivative formula so basically we need to find the derivative of a function using the limit process and f prime of x represents the derivative of f of x and it's equal to the limit as h approaches zero of f of x plus h minus f of x divided by h so that's the formula that we need to use so let's say if f of x is a linear function 5 x minus 4. what is f prime of x what's the first derivative of this function so go ahead and try that now what is f of x plus h how can we find that well if f of x is five x minus four then f of x plus h is going to be five times x plus h minus four so all you need to do is in f of x wherever you see an x replace it with x plus h so now let's plug in everything into this formula so it's going to be the limit as h approaches 0 and then it's going to be 5 x plus h minus 4 and then minus f of x which f of x is 5 x minus 4. and so we're going to divide all of this by h now let's simplify so first we need to distribute 5 to x plus h and don't forget to rewrite the limit expression until you get your final answer so it's going to be 5x plus 5h minus 4 and then distribute the negative sign so it's going to be negative 5x plus 4 divided by h now five x and negative five x they add up to zero negative four plus four is equal to zero so we're left over with the limit as h approaches zero 5 h divided by h and the h terms cancel h divided by h is 1 and so the limit as h approaches 0 for a constant like 5 since there's no h in this expression anymore this is simply equal to five so that's the derivative of five x minus four it's five now let's try another example so let's say if f of x is equal to x squared what is the first derivative of the function go ahead and use the definition of the derivative to find f prime of x so first let's use the formula f prime of x is equal to the limit as h approaches zero of f of x plus h minus f of x divided by h so if f of x is equal to x squared what is f of x plus h that's the first thing you need to decide so all we have to do is replace x with x plus h so it's going to be x plus h squared so we have the limit as h approaches 0 x plus h squared minus f of x which is originally just x squared divided by h now we need to foil x plus h squared so i'm going to expand it for now so what we really have is x plus h times another x plus h so let's foil x times x that's going to be x squared and since i'm running out of space i'm going to put this on the top and then x times h that's xh and then we have to multiply h times x which is also xh and finally h times h that's going to be h squared and then minus x squared all divided by h now let's combine like terms and let's cancel x squared and negative x squared adds up to zero and xh plus xh well that's 2xh and so we're going to have the limit as h approaches 0 for 2xh plus h squared divided by h now what do you think we need to do at this point once you get to this step what we need to do is factor out an h if we take out an h the gcf 2xh divided by h is 2x and h squared divided by h well that's h now we could cancel the h variables on the outside h divided by h is one so this gives us the limit as h approaches zero for two x plus h so now we're gonna apply this limit expression we're going to replace h with 0. so it's going to be 2x plus 0 which is 2x so if f of x is equal to x squared the derivative f prime of x is equal to 2x based on the definition formula of the derivative and that's the answer now let's work on another example so let's say if we have one over x what is the first derivative of one over x by the way feel free to pause the video and try these examples yourself so first let's find f of x plus h so if we replace x with x plus h we're going to get 1 over x plus h now let's start with the formula f prime of x is equal to the limit as h approaches zero f of x plus h minus f of x divided by h now f of x plus h we said it's one over x plus h and f of x is one over x and this is all divided by h so here we have a complex fraction what should we do in a situation like this if you have a complex fraction multiply the top and the bottom by the common denominator of these two fractions so the common denominator is going to be x times x plus h whatever you do to the top you must also do to the bottom of the complex fraction now we need to multiply so if we take this fraction and multiply by x times x plus h the x plus h terms will cancel eliminating this fraction and what we have left over is simply x so right now we're going to have the limit as h approaches 0 and on top we have an x right now now let's take the second fraction multiply by that term so if we do that x will cancel and we're going to get x plus h with a negative sign in front of it so this is going to be negative x plus h and on the bottom we simply just need to write these things together so it's going to be h times x times x plus h now let's distribute the negative sign so we're going to have the limit as h approaches 0 x minus x minus h x plus negative x adds up to zero and so this is going to give us the limit as h approaches zero negative h divided by h times x times x plus h negative h divided by h is negative one so now we have the limit as h approaches zero negative one over x times x plus h as soon as you cancel that h you can now use direct substitution so we can apply this limit expression let's replace h with zero now x plus zero is x so we have x times x which is x squared so the answer is negative one divided by x squared and that is the derivative of one over x now let's say that f of x is equal to the square root of x what is the first derivative f prime of x go ahead and try that so let's start with the formula f prime of x is equal to the limit as h approaches zero f of x plus h minus f of x over h now in this problem what do you think f of x plus h represents now don't forget all we need to do is replace x with x plus h so it's going to equal the square root of x plus h and f of x is simply the square root of x now what should we do if we have radicals in a fraction to simplify this expression you need to multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate of the numerator so the conjugate is going to have the same expression square root x plus h and square root x the difference is instead of a negative sign we are going to have a positive sign so now let's foil what we have on top so the square root of x plus h times itself the square roots will cancel and you're going to get x plus h and then we have these two terms which is going to be plus square root x square root x plus h and then if we multiply those two terms negative square root x times square root x plus h and finally the square root of x times the square root of x is simply x and don't forget about the negative sign and on the bottom don't distribute simply just i would recommend just rewriting it now the square root of x times the square root of x plus h we have a positive term and a negative one so they're going to add up and cancel to zero x to negative x will also add up to zero so now we're left with the limit as h approaches zero and it's h divided by h times the square root of x plus h plus the square root of x and as you know h divided by h is one so we're left with the limit as h approaches zero and we have this expression now what we need to do is direct substitution we need to replace h with zero at this point so x plus zero will simply be x now the square root of x plus the square root of x there's a coefficient of one one plus one is two so you should get one over 2 square root x by the way this limit expression should no longer be here when you replace h with 0 this expression disappears so it shouldn't be in this step anymore this is the final answer so that's the first derivative of the square root of x now what if the square root is in the bottom of a fraction like if we have 8 over the square root of x what's the first derivative of this function well first let's find f of x plus h so it's going to equal that now let's use the limit process to find the derivative so f of x plus h it's going to be 8 over the square root of x plus h and i'm forgetting the limit expression this is why it's always good to rewrite the formula just to avoid making mistakes so we have the limit as h approaches zero and then f of x plus h is eight over the square root of x plus h and then minus f of x and then divided by h so now we have a complex fraction with radicals so basically we have two problems combined into one we have the one over x problem with the square root of x problem so what i recommend is eliminating the fractions within the larger fractions so i'm going to multiply by the common denominator just to begin so it's going to be the square root of x times the square root of x plus h so these terms will cancel leaving behind eight times the square root of x and then when i multiply this fraction by that term the square root of x will cancel leaving behind these two so it's going to be negative 8 square root x plus h and on the bottom simply rewrite these things together so it's going to be h times the square root of x times the square root of x plus h now what should we do at this point what's our next move here so since we have radicals in the numerator we need to multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate of the numerator and so that's going to be eight square root x plus a square root x plus h divided by the same thing so let's foil this stuff on top so 8 square root x times itself what is that going to give us well we know 8 times 8 is 64. and the square root of x times the square root of x is x next we have 8 times 8 which is 64 and then square root x square root x plus h and then we have the two middle terms this is going to be negative 64 square root x square root x plus h and then finally negative eight times eight and then square root x plus h times itself which is just going to be x plus h and on the bottom just rewrite everything now this is a very long problem but if you have a problem like this on a test this is what you have to do so first we could cancel these two terms and then let's distribute negative 64 to x plus h so what we have now is 64x and then negative 64 x and negative 64 h divided by everything on the bottom now let's cancel those two terms and so we're left with limit as h approaches 0 negative 64 h divided by everything that is in the denominator which is a lot of stuff now in the next step we could cancel h because as soon as we can do that we can use direct substitution we can get rid of the other h variables in the bottom right now we have the limit as h approaches 0 negative 64 over square root x square root x plus h and so forth so now i'm going to replace h with 0 so i'm no longer going to write the limit expression so it's negative 64. and then we have square root x now this is going to be square root x plus 0 which is also square root x and then 8 times the square root of x and then we're going to replace h of 0 there so that's going to be 8 square root x as well now the square root of x times the square root of x is x and then 8 plus 8 is 16 and then we could divide negative 64 by 16. so we're going to get negative 4 over x square root x and so you can leave the answer like that if you want to x square root x is also x to the three halves you could write it that way too but that's the answer now the last example i'm going to go over is a polynomial function so let's say we have f of x is equal to x squared minus five x plus nine what's the first derivative of this function so first what's f of x plus h let's decide that so instead of writing x squared we're going to write x plus h squared instead of writing 5x is going to be 5 times x plus h so then f prime of x is going to be the limit as h approaches zero and then f of x plus h that's x plus h squared minus five x plus h plus nine and then minus f of x which is x squared minus five x plus nine don't forget to distribute the negative sign and this is all divided by h so first we need to expand x plus h squared already now we've done that early in this video so x plus h times x plus h we found that it was x squared plus two x h plus h squared now we need to distribute the five so it's going to be negative 5x minus 5h plus 9 and then distribute this negative sign so it's going to be negative x squared plus 5x minus 9 all divided by h so x squared and negative x squared can be cancelled negative 5x and 5x will disappear and 9 and negative 9 we can get rid of so now we have left over the limit as h approaches zero so we have h squared plus 2xh minus 5h divided by h now let's factor out the greatest common factor in the numerator which is h so h squared divided by h is h 2xh divided by h is 2x negative 5h divided by h is negative 5. so now we could cancel those two and so we have the limit as h approaches zero h plus two x minus five now let's use direct substitution let's replace h with zero so zero plus two x minus five is simply two x minus five so that's the first derivative of x squared minus five x plus nine it's two x minus five you 

Transcript for: The Constant Rule For Derivatives
in this lesson we're going to go over the constant rule for derivatives so the derivative of a constant c is equal to zero when you see this expression it means that you're differentiating c with respect to x so let's say for example if we want to differentiate five the derivative of five is equal to zero the derivative of a constant like negative seven is equal to zero so there's no variables attached to it it's going to be zero so for example let's say if y is equal to 24 the derivative of y which is y prime that's going to be zero let's say if f of x is equal to pi pi is not a variable it's a constant so the derivative of that function which is denoted f prime of x that's going to be zero now let's say if y was equal to e e is a constant so y prime will be zero so make sure you know which numbers are constants and which ones are not but if you see a number by itself or if you see pi or e those are constants and the derivative of any constant is zero but now let's prove that so let's say if we have a function and it's equal to eight let's show that f prime of x is equal to zero and let's use the definition of the derivative to show this so we know that f prime of x is equal to the limit as h approaches zero for f of x plus h minus f of x divided by h now if f of x is eight what is f of x plus h everywhere we see an x we need to replace it with x plus h because there's no x f of x plus h will simply be eight so we have the limit as h approaches zero eight and f of x is also eight divided by h so eight minus eight is zero so we have the limit as h approaches zero zero over h zero divided by h is zero so the whole thing is zero therefore the derivative of any constant will always be zero as you can see these two will be the same so thus we have the constant rule the derivative of some constant c will be equal to zero you 

Transcript for: Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions
today we're going to go over the derivatives of trigonometric functions and there's six of them that you need to know let's start with the first one the derivative of sine x is cosine x and the derivative of cosine x is negative sine x now look for a pattern as i write these uh trigonometric functions the derivative of tangent is secant squared and the derivative of cotangent the cofunction of tangent is cosecant squared but with a negative sign the derivative of secant that's equal to secant x tangent x and the derivative of cosecant x is negative cosecant x cotangent x so notice that the derivative for every cofunction particularly those that start with a c they all have a negative sign and notice that the similarity between tan and cotan the derivative of tangent is secant squared the derivative of cotan is negative cosecant squared and secant and cosecant are similar the derivative of secant is secant tan and the derivative of cosecant negative cosecant cotangent so there's some similarities here if you know the left side you can easily figure out what's on the right side of the screen but now let's go ahead and work on some examples so let's find the derivative of this expression five sine x minus four tangent x so distributing this symbol it's going to be five times the derivative of sine x minus four times the derivative of tangent x now we know that the derivative of sine is positive cosine and the derivative of tangent is secant squared so the answer is 5 cosine x minus 4 secant squared x now let's work on another similar example let's say if we want to find the derivative of eight secant x minus five cosine x so based on the last example go ahead and try this one so this is equal to eight times the derivative of secant x minus five times the derivative of cosine x now the derivative of secant that's going to be secant tangent the derivative of cosine is a negative sine so the final answer is going to be eight secant x tangent x plus five sine x now let's work on one more example let's try the derivative of two cotangent x minus seven cosecant x so this is going to be two times the derivative of cotangent x and then minus seven times the derivative of cosecant x now what is the derivative of cotangent x now think about the derivative of tangent the derivative of tangent is secant squared so the derivative of cotangent is going to be cosecant squared but because we have a c it's going to be a negative sign in front so it's going to be negative cosecant squared x the derivative of cosecant well we know that the derivative of secant is secant tangent so the derivative of cosecant will be negative cosecant cotangent so you really need to know the derivative of sine tangent and secant if you know those three you can figure out the other three so the final answer is going to be negative 2 cosecant squared plus 7 cosecant x cotangent x if you want to you can take out the gcf which is cosecant x i'm going to leave the answer like this you 

Transcript for: Derivative of Sine and Cosine Functions | Calculus
in this lesson we're going to focus on the derivatives of sine and cosine functions so here are some things you need to know the derivative of sine x is cosine x and the derivative of cosine x is negative sine x so with that information go ahead and try the following problems what is the derivative of 4 sine x and what is the derivative of 8 cosine x so using the constant multiple rule the derivative of 4 sine x is going to be 4 times the derivative of sine x and we know that the derivative of sine x is cosine x so the answer is simply 4 cosine x now for the second example this is going to be 8 times the derivative of cosine x and the derivative of cosine is negative sine so the final answer is going to be negative 8 sine x here's two more examples that you could try what's the derivative of three cosine x minus pi sine x and differentiate sine x divided by five go ahead and try those two problems so let's distribute this symbol the derivative of three cosine x minus pi sine x is equivalent to the derivative of three cosine x by itself and the derivative of pi sine x using the constant multiple rule and we have three times the derivative of cosine minus pi is a constant and then times the derivative of sine let me erase this the derivative of cosine is negative sine and the derivative of sine is positive cosine so the final answer is going to be negative 3 sine x minus pi cosine x now let's move on to the next example go ahead and find the derivative of sine x divided by five now the first thing i recommend doing is rewriting the expression so sine over five is basically one-fifth times sine x so now we can use the constant multiple rule so it's going to be the constant one-fifth times the derivative of sine x and the derivative of sine is cosine so it's one-fifth cosine x or you could simply say cosine x divided by 5. now let's say if f of x is sine x how can we prove that f prime of x is indeed cosine x how can we show that well we could use the limit definition of a derivative f prime of x is equal to the limit as h approaches zero f of x plus h minus f of x divided by h so if f of x is sine x what is f of x plus h all we need to do is replace x with x plus h so this is going to be sine x plus h so therefore f prime of x is equal to the limit as h approaches zero sine x plus h minus sine x divided by h now what do we need to do at this point how can we even simplify this expression so what recommendations do you have at this point now you need to be familiar with the sum and difference formulas for sine and cosine so for sine its sine alpha plus beta is equal to sine alpha cosine beta plus cosine alpha sine beta now if we look at the similarities between these two expressions we can replace alpha with x and beta with h so this is going to be x h and then this is x h so now we can say that f prime of x is equal to the limit as h approaches 0 and on top we have sine x cosine h plus cosine x sine h and then minus sine x divided by h now i'm going to change the order of the two terms basically i'm going to switch these two terms and you'll see why five plus three and three plus five is the same so if you're adding two terms you can reverse the order so i'm gonna have cosine x sine h and then plus sine x cosine h minus sine x now even though i have three terms in the numerator i'm going to separate it not into three fractions but into two fractions so i'm going to divide this by h and so i'm going to have the limit as h approaches 0 cosine x sine h divided by h now i'm going to take these two terms and divided by h so my next fraction is going to be plus and i'm going to reverse the order of these two terms negative sine x plus sine x times cosine h divided by h and i need to rewrite the limit expression so there should be a limit as h approaches 0 in that expression so i'm going to take this cosine and move it to the front because it's not affected by this limit expression only h's so i'm going to have cosine x and then times the limit as h approaches 0 sine h divided by h now for the second fraction i can factor out the gcf which is sine x so i'm going to take out negative sine x so i have the limit as h approaches zero negative sine x and is going to be negative sine x divided by itself is positive one and sine cosine divided by negative sign that's going to be negative cosine divided by h now i'm going to take this term move it to the front so i'm going to have minus sine x and then the limit as h approaches 0 1 minus cosine h divided by h perhaps you see where i'm going with this there's two special trigonometric limits that you need to be familiar with the limit as x approaches zero for sine x over x is equal to one that's one of the limits you need to know and if you're not sure about this try plug in a small number close to zero sine of 0.1 divided by 0.1 is 0.998 and as you get closer to 0 let's say 0.01 and it has to be in radian mode not degree mode this is going to be 0.99998 so it gets closer to 1. the second trigonometric limit you need to know is this one the limit as x approaches 0 one minus cosine x over x is equal to zero so these are the two that you need to know in order to do this problem so let's go ahead and finish it so the limit as h approaches zero for sine h over h that's going to equal one and the limit as h approaches zero for one minus cosine over h that's going to be zero so zero times sine is zero so the final answer is cosine so therefore the derivative of sine is equal to cosine you 

Transcript for: Alternate Form of The Limit Definition of the Derivative - Calculus
let's talk about the alternative form of the derivative now let's say we have some function f ofx and let's define it to be equal to X Cub now we know what the first derivative of that function is using the power rule the derivative of x Cub is going to be 3x^2 now let's say if we plug in some point let's say say 4 this is going to be 3 * 4^ 2 which is 3 * 16 that's 48 so this is the derivative of f ofx as a function and this number when we evaluate the derivative at a point we get the slope of the tangent line now we can find the derivative of the function using limits so frime of X is equal to the Limit as H approaches zero of FX + hus FX / H so this is the limit definition of the derivative and using this formula it will give us frime of X is equal to 3x^2 now the alternative form of the definition of the derivative is this equation frime of a is equal to the Limit as X approaches a of f ofx - F of a over x - A now this form of the derivative it will give you a number as opposed to a function that depends on X so using this you can get the slope of the tangent line which is 48 when X is 4 so make sure you understand understand the difference between these two formulas so this formula will give you the derivative as a function and this formula will evaluate that derivative at some point where xal a let's use both of these two formulas so you could see how it works so let's start with this one so frime of X is going to be the limit as H approaches zero and then we have f of x + H so in this formula we're going to replace x with X+ H so X Cub will become x + H Cub now minus F ofx so f ofx is simply X cub and then div divid H so now how can we evaluate this limit notice that we have a difference of two cubes when you see that we could use this formula a 3r minus B 3r is going to be a minus B * a 2 + a b + b^ 2 so in that example a is going to be x + h B will be X so a minus B that's going to be x + H that's a and then minus b - x so that part is just the a minus B part now we need this part so a 2 that's going to be x + h^ 2 then a * B so we're multiplying these two that's going to be X * x + H or you can write it in reverse it'll be the same and then plus b^2 B is X so b^2 is x s and this is going to be divided by H now of course I need to rewrite this expression so this is as the limit as H approaches zero now X and negative X will cancel so what we have left over is the limit as H approaches zero we have an H left over so it's h and then time x + h^ 2 + x * x + H * x^2 we don't need to foil or distribute what we have here I'm just going to leave it that way now notice that we can cancel H as soon as the H from the bottom is gone we can now use direct substitution so I'm going to replace the remaining H with with 0o so this is going to be x + 0 2 + x * x + 0 + x^2 x + 0 2 is just X2 and then x * X that's X2 is again if you add x^2 three times you're going to get 3 x^2 and so we could see that these two answers they match so this formula gives you the derivative as a function now let's use the second one so let's calculate frime of a so a is going to be the number inside of fime which is four so we're looking for for fim of 4 this is going to be the limit as X approaches 4 of F ofx F ofx is X Cub minus F of a so F of a is the same as F of four so we're plugging four into that function so F of 4 is going to be 4 to the 3 power and then over x - A or x - 4 now once again we're going to use the difference of perfect cubes formula so we're going to factor as a minus B * a 2 + a b + b 2 so a is X B is 4 this is going to be the limit as X approaches 4 and then x - 4 * a 2 that's going to be x^2 and then a * B that's 4 * x + b^ 2 B is going to be 4^ 2 and then over x -4 now notice that we could cancel x - 4 now once we do that we're left with this expression now once we get rid of the x- 4 on the bottom we can now use direct substitution so replace an X with 4 we're going to have 4^ 2 + 4 * 4 + 4^ 2 4^ 2 or 4 * 4 that's going to be 16 when you add 16 3 times is the same as 16 * 3 which is 48 so as you could see the alternate form of the derivative basically evaluates the derivative for us at some point or X is equal to a so I want to make sure you understand the difference between the two formulas and how to use them so that's basically it for this video 

Transcript for: Limits and Derivatives
what is the limit as h approaches 0 of the expression ln x plus h minus ln x divided by h how do you go about evaluating this limit well the only thing you could do is you need to recognize the formula that this expression is associated with that is the definition of the derivative f prime of x is equal to the limit as h approaches zero of f of x plus h minus f of x over h so in order to find the value of this expression we need to determine what f of x is we can clearly see that f of x is ln x and this entire expression is equal to f prime of x so what is the derivative of ln x the derivative of l and x is one over x so that's the answer to the original expression it's simply equal to one over x the derivative of l and x let's try another one let's say we have the limit as h approaches zero of sine x plus h minus sine x divided by h so once again what we need to do is determine f of x because this entire expression is equal to f prime of x f of x in this problem is going to equal sine x so all we need to do is find the derivative of sine so hopefully you remember your the derivatives of trigonometric functions the derivative of sine is cosine and so this entire expression is equal to cosine of x so that's how you can evaluate limits that appear in this form now what about this problem let's say we have the limit as x approaches pi over six and we have the expression tangent x minus tangent pi over six divided by x minus pi over 6 so go ahead and take a minute and try that example this one is a little bit different than the previous two examples now the first thing we need to do is find the formula that corresponds to this expression and here it is this is the alternative definition of the derivative f prime of a is equal to the limit as x approaches a of f of x minus f of a over x minus a so what we need to do is determine two things in these two expressions f of x and a so we can clearly see that f of x is tangent x and we could also see that a is pi over six so this entire expression is equal to f prime of a or f prime of pi over six now if f of x is equal to tangent x what is f prime of x what is the derivative of tangent x the derivative of tangent is secant squared now our goal is to find f prime of a that's what this entire expression is equal to or f prime of pi over six so if f prime of x is secant x what is f prime of pi over six if we can get that that's going to be the answer to this entire expression f prime of pi over six is going to be equal to secant squared pi over six now what is secant squared pi over six secant is one over cosine so secant squared is going to be one over cosine squared pi over six now what is cosine pi over six cosine pi over six or cosine of 30 degrees is equal to the square root of three over two now this is squared the square root of three squared is just three two squared is four so we have one over three over four which is four over three so this right here is the final answer to the problem that's equal to the value of this limit 

Transcript for: How To Find The Equation of The Tangent Line With Derivatives
in this lesson we're going to focus on how to find the equation of a tangent line given a point using derivatives so let's say if we have a function f of x and it's equal to 2x squared minus 5x plus three and we wish to find the equation of the tangent line when x is equal to two so what equation should we use we need to use the point slope form of a linear equation at least that's the preferred form i like to use you can also use the slope-intercept form if you prefer it that way now we need to find two things right now we already have x1 x1 is two we need to calculate y1 that is y when x is two and we need to determine the slope so to find the y coordinate we simply have to take x and plug it into this equation make sure you understand this f of a is equal to y where a is a specific value of x in this example a is equal to 2. now x can be anything x could be 5 7 12 a is that specific value of x so f of a is y and f prime of a is equal to m so in order to find m you have to find the first derivative and then replace x with 2. in order to calculate y you need to replace x with 2 in the original function f of x so let's determine y first so y is equal to f of two this is y one specifically and that's gonna be two times two squared minus five times two plus three two squared is four five times two is ten and two times four is eight eight minus ten is negative two negative two plus three is one so y one is one now the only thing we need to do is calculate the slope when x is equal to two so first we got to find the first derivative the derivative of x squared is 2x the derivative of x is 1 and the derivative of a constant like 3 is 0. so f prime of x is equal to four x minus five the slope is going to equal f prime of two so that's going to be four times two minus five four times two is eight eight minus five is three so the slope of the tangent line is equal to three when x is two now make sure you understand the difference between the derivative and the slope the derivative is a function in terms of x in this particular example the slope is a specific value of the derivative function at some x value so when x is 2 the slope is 3. however the slope can change with this function for example when x is one the slope will be negative one so the derivative is a function that gives you the slope at any x value now let's plug in what we have so that we can write the equation of the tangent line so it's y minus one which is equal to three times x minus two so this is the answer in point slope form but let's get it in slope intercept form so let's solve for y let's distribute the three first so it's going to be three x minus six and then let's add one to both sides negative six plus one is negative five so here we have the equation of the tangent line in slope intercept form let's work on another example so let's say that f of x is equal to eight x minus x squared write the equation of the tangent line at x equals seven so go ahead and work on this problem feel free to pause it and see if you got the concept so the first thing i'm going to do is calculate the y value so let's call this x one y1 is going to equal to f of 7 which is going to be 8 times 7 minus 7 squared 8 times 7 is 56 7 times 7 is 49 56 minus 49 is 7. so y1 is 7. so now that we have x and we have y all we need to find is m so let's go ahead and determine the first derivative of the function so f prime of x is going to equal the derivative of x is one the derivative of x squared is 2x so it's 8 minus 2x now let's determine the slope which is going to be the first derivative evaluated at an x value of 7. so it's f prime of seven so it's going to be eight minus two times seven two times seven is fourteen and eight minus fourteen is negative six so the slope is equal to negative six now let's use the point slope formula y one is seven m is negative six x one is seven so that's the equation of the tangent line in point slope form which you can leave it like that if you want to but let's get it in slope intercept form so i'm going to distribute the negative six so it's going to be negative 6x and then negative 6 times negative 7 that's positive 42. now we need to add 7 to both sides so it's going to be negative 6x plus 49. this is the equation of the tangent line in slope intercept form that's the final answer now let's work on one more example but this time the example is going to be associated with a trig function so let's say that f of x is 4 sine x minus three and we wish to write the equation of the tangent line when x is equal to pi over six go ahead and work on that example now first let's calculate y when x is pi over six so we need to evaluate the function at pi over six so this is going to be four sine pi over six minus three now what is sine pi over six equal to now pi is equal to 180 degrees so 180 divided by 6 is 30. so pi over 6 and radians is equivalent to 30 degrees sine 30 or sine pi over 6 is one half and you can use the unit circle or your calculator to figure that out four times a half is two two minus three is negative one so therefore y is negative one when x is pi over six now let's calculate the slope when x is pi over six so we need to find the first derivative so what is the derivative of four sine x minus three the derivative of sine is cosine and the derivative of negative three is zero so it's just four cosine x so now let's evaluate it when x is pi over six so this is going to be four times cosine pi over six now what is cosine pi over six equal to what's cosine of 30 degrees cosine pi over six is equal to the square root of three over two now hopefully you remember your 30 60 90 triangle this can help you with these things across the 30 is 1 across the 60 is the square root of 3 across the 90 is 2. so let's say if you want to evaluate sine 30 using sohcahtoa you know that sine is opposite over hypotenuse so opposite to 30 is one and the hypotenuse is across the box which is the longest side that's two so sine 30 or sine pi over six is one half cosine 30 based on sohcahtoa cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse adjacent to 30 is the square root of three and the hypotenuse is still two so that's a quick review that can help you to remember some basic trig functions whenever you need to evaluate it now let's finish this problem four divided by two is two so the slope is equal to two square root three now let's go to the point-slope formula of the linear equation y one is negative one m is two square root three and x one is pi over six now y minus negative one is the same as y plus one so you can leave it in this form if you want to in fact i think it's best to leave it in this form you don't want to multiply 2 root 3 by pi over 6 it's not going to look nice so i'm going to leave the answer in point slope form so that's the equation of the tangent line for this problem you 

Transcript for: How To Find The Equation of a Tangent Line Using Derivatives - Calculus 1
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the equation of a tangent line like this problem that you see on a board but let's go over some basic information so what is a tangent line let's say if we have a curve the tangent line is a line that touches the curve at exactly one point so that will be the tangent line in order to find the equation of the tangent line there's two things that we need we need the point at which the tangent line touches the curve and so we need the x and the y coordinate of that point which we have that in this problem and the second thing that we need is the slope of the tangent line so how can we find the slope of the tangent line we could find it by taking the first derivative of the function and evaluating it at the x coordinate of the point that touches the curve and the tangent line so those are the two things that we need we need the slope and we need the x y coordinate of the point where the tangent line touches the curve now once we have those two things we can now use this formula that is the point-slope formula in order to write the equation of the tangent line so let's go ahead and begin so we already have our point and so we can see that x1 is 1 y1 is 12. all we need to do is calculate the slope of the tangent line so we're going to do that by finding the first derivative f prime of x and just to review the derivative of x to the n let's say if you have a variable raised to a constant basically the power rule it's n x to the n minus one so the derivative of x raised to the fourth power is going to be we can see that n is four so it's four x to the 4 minus 1 or 4 x cubed and so that's the derivative of the first term x to the fourth power now let's use that same process for everything else so what is the derivative of x cubed don't worry about the five but what's the derivative of x cubed using this process the derivative of x cubed is going to be three x to the three minus one which is three x squared now we need to multiply by five according to the constant multiple rule so this is what we now have now the derivative of x squared is 2x to the first power and the derivative of a constant is always zero so we'll have to worry about that now five times three is fifteen and nine times two is eighteen so this is the first derivative of the function now we can calculate the slope of the tangent line and the way we're going to do it is we're going to take our x value which is one and plug it into this expression so the slope of the tangent line will be f prime of one and so that's going to be four times one raised to the third power plus fifteen times one squared plus eighteen times one so that turns out to be four plus fifteen plus eighteen fifteen plus eighteen that's thirty three plus four that's thirty seven so the slope of the tangent line is 37 so now that we have the slope and we have the x and the y coordinates of the point where the tangent line touches the curve we can now use this formula so y1 is 12 m is 37 and x1 is one so this is the answer but in something known as point slope form now some teachers they might be okay with you writing your answer like this others they may want you to write it in slope intercept form so that is in y equals mx plus b form and so to get it in slope intercept form what you need to do is isolate the y variable in the equation so we're going to do is distribute the 37 first so this is going to be 37x minus 37 and then in the next step we're going to add 12 to both sides and so this is going to be y is equal to 37 x and then negative 37 plus 12 that's negative 25 and so this right here is the equation of the tangent line in slope intercept form so now you know how to find it now let's work on number two write the equation of the tangent line to the graph of f of x which equals x cubed times ln x at x equals one so feel free to pause the video if you want to try this problem so remember in order to write the equation of the tangent line we need the slope of the tangent line and we need the x and the y coordinates of the point where the tangent line touches the curve right now we only have the x coordinate but we do not have the y coordinate so let's write down what we know we know that x1 is one we need to find y1 and the slope of the tangent line this should not be a one here that should be a question mark so how can we calculate y1 what do we need to do we need to use the original function f x y is basically equal to the function evaluated at x1 so what we need to do is we need to plug in x equals 1 into that function so y1 is going to be f of one which is one to the third times the natural log of one now the the natural log of one is always zero so in this case y one is zero so that's the first thing we need to do the second thing is that we need to find the derivative so we need to determine f prime of x so what is the derivative of x cubed times the natural log of x what would you say we need to use the product rule the derivative of f times g is going to be the derivative of the first part f or f prime times the second part where it's unchanged so that's g plus the first part times the derivative of the second part so we can say that f is the first part of that function so f is x cubed which means that f prime is going to be the derivative of that which is 3x squared the second part g that's going to be the natural log of x and so g prime the derivative of ln x is one over x now for those of you who may need to review some derivative techniques such as differentiating natural log functions or things like the product rule quotient rule chain rule and other stuff like that check out the links in the description section below and i'm going to post some other videos that might be useful to you so let's get back to this one so using this formula we have f prime which is 3x squared times g so g is just ln x and then plus f which is x cubed and then times g prime which is 1 over x and so that's how you could use the product rule to find the derivative of a function now we need to calculate the slope of the tangent line and we're going to evaluate f prime of x at our x coordinate which our x coordinate is one so this is going to be three times one squared times the natural log of one plus now x cubed divided by x that's x squared so we're gonna have one squared now as we said before the natural log of one is zero so this completely disappears and then plus one squared which is one thus the slope of the tangent line is equal to one now once we have the x and y coordinate of the point and the slope we can now use the point slope formula to write the equation of the tangent line so y one is zero the slope m is one and x one is also one so we could basically ignore this zero and thus our equation simplifies to y is equal to x minus one and this is it so now you know how to find the equation of a tangent line so that's basically it for this video if you

Transcript for: How to Find The Point Where The Graph has a  Horizontal Tangent Lines Using Derivatives
determine the point at which the graph has a horizontal tangent line so let's say if we're given a function x cubed minus six x squared plus fifteen how can we determine at which point this particular graph will have a horizontal tangent line well let's draw a rough sketch not of this function but just of some generic function so let's say if we have a function that looks like that a tangent line touches the curve only at one point now so this for example would be a tangent line it touches it only at one point a secant line touches the curve at two points now we want a horizontal tangent line and that occurs at a maximum or a minimum so these two would be a horizontal tangent line now what you need to know is that the slope of any horizontal line is zero so therefore to find a point at which the graph has a horizontal tangent line we need to find the first derivative and set it equal to zero because that's when the slope of the curve will be zero and then we need to solve for x so let's begin by finding the first derivative the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of the constant 15 is 0. so f prime of x is equal to 3x squared minus 12x now because we're dealing with the horizontal tangent line we need to set this equal to zero since the slope has to be zero and now we need to calculate the value of x so let's factor out the gcf which is 3x 3x squared divided by 3x is x and negative 12x divided by 3x is negative 4. so now let's set each factor equal to zero here if we divide by three we can see that x is equal to zero and if we add four to both sides x is equal to four so the two points are zero and four that's where the horizontal tangent lines will occur now sometimes you may need to write your answer as an ordered pair so let's calculate the y values that correspond to these two x values so let's evaluate f of zero this is going to be zero q minus six times zero squared plus fifteen and that's equal to 15. so the first ordered pair has a x value of 0 and a y value of 15. now for the second one let's replace x with 4. 4 to the third power that's 4 times 4 times 4 that's 64. 4 squared is 16 and if we add 64 and 15 that's going to be 79 6 times 16 is 96 and the difference between 79 and 96 that's 17 so this is going to be negative 17. so we have the point four comma negative seventeen so these are the locations of the horizontal tangent line or the point at which the graph has a horizontal tangent line now let's work on one more problem let's say if f of x is four x cubed minus seven x squared minus six x plus four so go ahead and find the points at which this function has a horizontal tangent line so if we follow the same procedure we need to find the first derivative and set it equal to zero the derivative of x cubed is three x squared and the derivative of x squared is two x the derivative of x is one and the derivative of a constant is always zero so f prime of x is equal to 12 x squared 7 times 2 is 14 and minus 6. so let's set this equal to 0. so how can we factor this particular trinomial in order to calculate x one of the first things we should do is take out the gcf which is two twelve x squared divided by two is six x squared negative fourteen x divided by 2 is negative 7x and negative 6 divided by 2 is negative 3. now what do you think we need to do at this point so let's focus on factoring 6x squared minus x minus three we could ignore the two for now if we want to we could divide both sides by two because zero divided by two is still zero so that will disappear and now we have this expression if you need to factor a trinomial where the leading coefficient is not 1 multiply the leading coefficient by the constant term 6 times negative 3 is negative 18. now we need to find two numbers that multiply to negative 18 but add to the middle coefficient negative seven so this is going to be negative nine and two negative nine plus two is negative seven but negative nine times two is negative eighteen now let's replace negative seven 7x with negative 9x and positive 2x and then we need to factor by grouping so in the first two terms take out the greatest common factor which is going to be 3x 6x squared divided by 3x is 2x negative 9x divided by 3x is negative 3. now for the last two terms there is no gcf to take out so we have to take out a 1 and we will be left with 2x minus 3. now we need to factor out the gcf again which is 2x minus 3. so if we take it out of this term we're left with 3x and if we take it out of that term we're left with positive one so now we have a completely factored expression so let's set each factor equal to zero so let's add 3 to both sides so we have 2x is equal to 3 and then let's divide by 2. so the first point is that three over two for the next one let's subtract both sides by one and then let's divide by three so the second point is at negative one one-third so those are the points where the horizontal tangent line touches the curve you could find the y-coordinates if you want to but i'm going to stop here so that's it for this video you 

Transcript for: How To Find The Equation of the Normal Line
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the equation of a normal line so let me just give you some background information on this let's say we have the curve y is equal to x squared and we want to find the normal line at some point let's say at this point the tangent line is the line that intersects this curve at one point i'm going to put t for tangent the normal line which i'm going to draw on blue it is the line that is perpendicular to the tangent line so let's say that the slope of the tangent line is positive 4 over the slope of the normal line is going to be the reciprocal the negative reciprocal of this value negative five over four but the point of intersection is the same so that's what you need to know about this type of problem once you calculate the slope of the tangent line at let's say in this case x equals 2 you need to find the negative reciprocal of that that's going to give you the slope of the normal line and then using the point you can write the equation of the normal line with this formula all you need is the x y coordinate where the normal line touches the curve and you need the slope of the normal line so let me show you how to do that with this particular problem so first we need the point we have the x coordinate of the point but not the y coordinate to find the y coordinate we can plug in our x value into that formula so let's replace x with two so this is going to be two to the third minus four times two squared plus five two to the third power that's two times two times two that's eight two squared is four and then four times four is sixteen eight minus sixteen is negative eight negative eight plus five is negative three so the y coordinate is negative three thus we have the point two negative three now the next thing we need to do is calculate the slope of the tangent line which will help us get the slope with the normal line we can get the slope of the tangent line by taking the first derivative of the function keep in mind the derivative of a variable raised to a constant such as x raised to the n is going to be n times x raised to the n minus 1. so the derivative of x cubed is going to be 3 x 3 minus 1 or 2. the derivative of x squared is going to be 2x to the first power and the derivative of a constant like 5 is 0. so the first derivative of this function is going to be three x squared minus eight x now to get the slope of the tangent line we're gonna plug in x equals two so this is gonna be three times two squared minus eight times two so two squared is four four times three is twelve and eight times two is sixteen twelve minus sixteen is negative four so negative four is the slope of the tangent line to calculate the slope of the normal line we're going to change the sign from negative to positive and we're going to reciprocate four or flip it over one which will make it one over four i mean flip it under one rather so that is the slope of the normal line it's positive one over four so in order to write the equation of any line all we need is the slope of the line and a point on the line and we could define any line so let's use the point slope formula y minus y one is equal to m times x minus x1 so y1 is this is going to be y1 and that's x1 y1 is negative 3 m is 1 over 4 and x1 is 2. so two negative signs will change into a positive sign so this is going to be y plus three and then we're going to distribute the fraction to x minus two so this is gonna be one over four x one over four times negative two that's negative two over four which reduces to negative one half now the next thing we're gonna do is subtract both sides by three so we have y is equal to one fourth x negative one half minus three three can be written as six over two so this becomes negative seven over two this is the answer in slope intercept form by the way if you you can also leave your answer in point slope form especially if you're dealing with multiple choice tests so you could write your answer like this as well both answers are correct they're simply different ways of representing them and so that's basically it that's how you could find the equation of a normal line if you're given a curve and either the x value or the entire point at which you need to find the normal line now for the sake of practice let's go ahead and work on another example number two find the equation of the normal line to the curve y equal 3x squared minus 5x minus 7 at x equal 3. so let's begin by calculating the y value when x is three so we're gonna have three times three squared minus five times three minus seven three squared is nine five times three is fifteen and three times nine is twenty seven i'm going to reverse the order of these two to make the operation easier 27 minus seven is 20 and twenty minus fifteen is five so we got the point three comma five so that's where we want to find the equation of the normal line that's where it touches the curve so now the next thing we need to do is calculate the first derivative and use that to determine the slope of the tangent line the derivative of x squared is two x the derivative of x is one for those of you who want to know why here's what you can do so moving the one to the front and then we're gonna have x one minus one is zero anything raised to the zero power is one so you just get one and the derivative of a constant is zero using the power rule here's one way to show it so negative seven is equivalent to negative seven times x raised to zero moving to zero to the front we have negative seven times zero x to the minus one which will equal zero so right now we have that the first derivative is going to be six x minus five now let's replace x with three to get the slope of the tangent line so it's going to be six times three minus five six times three is eighteen eighteen minus five is thirteen now the slope of the normal line is going to be negative 1 of or divided by the slope of the tangent line so it's negative 1 divided by 13. so now we have everything that we need we got the slope of the normal line and we have the point at which it meets up with the curve so now let's use the point slope formula y minus y1 is equal to m times x minus x one y one is five m is negative one over thirteen and x one is three so if we want the answer in point-slope form we could leave it like this but let's get it in slope-intercept form so let's distribute negative 1 over 13 to x and to negative 3. so negative 1 times negative 3 that's going to be positive 3 but over 13. now the next thing that we need to do is add 5 to both sides so we're going to have y is equal to negative 1 over 13x now three over thirteen plus five i'm gonna write five as five over one and then i'm going to multiply the top and bottom by thirteen five times thirteen five times ten is fifty five times three is fifteen add in fifty plus fifteen gives us sixty five now that we have the same denominator we can add the numerators of the two fractions so 3 plus 65 is 68 so this is plus 68 over 13. so that's how we can write the equation of the normal line for this particular problem in slope intercept form so that's it for this video the next video that i'm going to create related to this topic is finding the slope of a secant line so if you want to do a youtube search on that just type in how to find the slope of a secant line organic chemistry tutor and it should come up but that's it for this video thanks for watching 

Transcript for: How To Find The Equation of a Secant Line
consider this problem find the equation of the secant line that intersects the curve y equals x squared minus 4 at x equals negative 1 and at x equals 2. how can we find the equation of a secant line to find the equation of any line all you need is a point with an x y coordinate and the slope of the line let's draw a picture of what we have so the graph x squared is a parabola that opens in the upward direction but what we have is x squared minus four so this graph has been shifted down four units so here is a generic shape of the graph now what i'm going to do is find the x intercepts so if we set the function equal to 0 we can factor it using the difference of perfect squares technique the square root of x squared is x the square root of 4 is 2 and then one sine will be positive the other side will be negative now if we were to solve for each factor we're going to get x equals 2 and x is equal to negative two so these are the x-intercepts now we're interested in finding the equation of the secant line that intersects the curve when x is negative 1 and when x is 2. so when x is negative 1 the curve is there and when x is 2 that's the x-intercept so the secant line is a line that touches the curve at two points or rather it intersects the curve at two points my drawn is terrible let's do this one more time so that is the secant line that we're focused on we need to find the equation of that line in order to find the equation of any line we need to get the slope but before we can get the slope we need to find the two points of interest on this line so we know the coordinates for this point we can clearly see that x is two y is zero for the first one we know the x value we don't know the y value but we could find it by replacing x with negative one in that equation so y is going to be equal to negative one squared minus four negative one squared is positive one one minus four is negative three so we got the point negative one comma negative three so now that we have the two points on the secant line we can use those two points to calculate the slope of the secant line and we're going to use this familiar formula you've seen it before m is equal to y2 minus y1 divided by x2 minus x1 so let's call negative 1 x1 and y1 is going to be negative 3. 2 is going to be x2 0 is going to be y2 so y2 minus y1 that's 0 minus negative 3 and then x2 minus x1 that's going to be 2 minus negative one zero minus negative three that's the same as zero plus three two minus negative one is equivalent to two plus one so the slope is three divided by three which is one so that's how we could find the slope of a secant line now the next thing is to write the equation of the line so now that we have the slope we can use the point slope formula all we need is a point and a slope so let's use this point we're going to replace y one with negative three m is one and x one we're gonna replace that with negative one so this becomes y plus three and that's equal to one times x plus one which we can simply write that as x plus 1. now the last thing that we could do at this point is subtract both sides by 3. so we're going to have y is equal to x and then 1 minus 3 is negative 2. so we have y is equal to x minus two this is the equation of the secant line this is the final answer that's all we could do for this problem so now you know how to find it so that's basically it for this video for those of you who like it don't forget to subscribe to this channel and hit that notification bell thanks again for watching 

Transcript for: Instantaneous Rate of Change
now the next thing we're going to talk about is the difference between the average rate of change and the instantaneous rate of change so let's say if you're given a function f of x is equal to x cubed and the question asked what is the instantaneous rate of change at x equal one the instantaneous rate of change is simply f prime of one you just gotta find the first derivative and determine its value when x is one so first let's find f prime of x using a power rule it's simply three x squared so the instantaneous rate of change at x equals 1 is 3 times 1 squared which is 3. this value represents the slope of the tangent line now what exactly is that so let's say if we graph x cubed let's focus on the right side at x equals one which is probably around here if we draw a line that touches the curve at one point only that's the tangent line the slope of that line is equal to one if you recall slope is basically the rise over the run you can calculate the slope by dividing the change in y by the change in x so the slope of the tangent line at a point is the same as the instantaneous rate of change so for this example it's equal to three now what about the average rate of change what is the average rate of change between the points 0 2 that is when x is 0 and when x is 2 and also let's say between 1.9 and 2.1 notice what happens when you calculate it for these two different uh for these two different intervals let's start with the first one to find the average rate of change is simply f of b minus f of a over b minus a so let's just call this average so what is a and what is b a is zero b is two i do want to change this i want to make that 0.9 and 1.1 but let's focus on this example so we need to find f of two minus f of zero divided by two minus zero to find f of two we gotta plug it into this equation so that's uh two to the third power minus zero to the third power divided by two two to the third is eight zero to the third is just zero and eight divided by two is four so notice that the average rate of change is four which is close to the instantaneous rate of change the instantaneous rate of change at x equals one is three so they're not too far apart notice that the midpoint between a and b that is the midpoint between zero and two is one whenever that's the case you can use the average rate of change to estimate the instantaneous rate of change now 0 and 2 are not very very close to 1 however 0.9 and 1.1 are much closer to 1 than 0 and 2r and 1 is the midpoint of 0.9 and 1.1 as these two values approach this value the average rate of change approaches the instantaneous rate of change so let's calculate the average rate of change using these values and let's see what's going to happen so f of 1.1 minus f of 0.9 divided by 1.1 minus 0.9 so we're going to need a calculator for this 1.1 raised to the third power is about point three three one point nine raised to the third power is point seven two nine one point one minus point nine is point two one point three three one minus point 0.729 that's 0.602 and if we divide that by 0.2 this is equal to 3.01 so as you can see the average rate of change is very close to the instantaneous rate of change here's an example let's say that f of x is equal to x to the fourth power what i want you to do is to estimate the instantaneous rate of change at x equals two using the average rate of change so to use the average rate of change formula we'll need two x values so let's pick two x values that are very close to two let's use one point nine and two point one one point nine and two point one are close to two and two is the midpoint of 1.9 2.1 you want to make sure it's right in the middle so let's evaluate the average rate of change it's going to be f of b minus f of a divided by b minus a where a is 1.9 and b is 2.1 so this is equal to 2.1 raised to the fourth power minus 1.9 raised to the fourth power divided by 0.2 2.1 to the fourth power that's 19.4481 1.9 raised to the fourth power that's 13 13.0321 so let's go ahead and subtract those two numbers you should get 6.4 and if we divide that by 0.2 we get 32.08 so the instantaneous rate of change is approximately about now to find the exact instantaneous rate of change we need to find the first derivative the derivative of x to the fourth is 4 x cubed and now all we got to do is plug in 2. so that's going to be 4 times 2 to the third power 2 to the third power is 8 4 times 8 is 32 so the instantaneous rate of change is exactly 32 and this is an approximation now you might be wondering why do we need to approximate it if we already have the function if we can already find the exact value using the function sometimes you may not be given the function sometimes you might have a table of values and so you can't just find the derivative of a function when you don't have it if you have a table of values the only way you can get the only way you can approximate the instantaneous rate of change is by using the average rate of change formula so let's say if we have a table let's say this table represents the distance that an object travels given the time so at t equals zero the distance traveled is zero five seconds later the distance traveled is let's say 12 meters 10 seconds later the total distance traveled 24.3 15 seconds later let's say it's about 37.1 20 seconds later 49.8 25 seconds later 76.1 so t is in seconds and the unit for d is in meters estimate the instantaneous speed when t is equal to 15. so what is the speed of the object at t equals 15. so here's 15. we have the distance the speed is basically distance divided by time so to find the instantaneous speed we can estimate it using the average speed and to find the average speed it's going to be the distance at 20 minus the distance at 10 divided by 20 minus so you have to use the average rate of change the rate of change of distance is speed now we chose 10 and 20 because 15 is right in the middle of 10 and 20. you don't want to use 10 to 15 because that's going to give you the average speed at 12.5 and you don't want to use 15 and 20 because you're going to estimate the average speed at 17.5 i mean the instantaneous speed at 17.5 so if you want to get the estimate of the instantaneous speed at 15 use 10 and 20. because 15 is the midpoint of 10 and 20 and out of everything that we have listed 10 and 20 is closest to 15. we don't use 5 and 25 even though 15 is the midpoint of those values because they're too far away from 15. so you want to use two numbers that where 15 is the midpoint and at the same time they're close to 15. so now let's go ahead and get the answer so the distance at t equals 20 is 49.8 and the distance at t equals 10 is 24.3 20 minus 10 is 10. so now let's subtract the two values 49.8 minus 24.3 is about 25.5 and if we divide that by 10 this is about 2.55 and it's meters per second because distance was on top which is meters and the time was on the bottom which is seconds so you get the speed meters per second so the instantaneous uh speed is approximately about 2.55 that's the average speed but the instantaneous speed should be somewhere around 2.5 2.6 you 

Transcript for: Average Velocity and Instantaneous Velocity
so in this video we're going to talk about average velocity instantaneous velocity position functions and all the little questions that go with that type of problem so let's start with this one a ball is thrown straight upward from a building so let's draw a picture this is like a calculus slash projectile motion type problem so we got this ball and it's going to go up and then it's going to go down now in reality it goes straight up and then straight down so just keep that in mind it really doesn't move to the right now we're given the position function that describes the height of this ball above ground level so s let's say at this point will be the difference between ground level and the point of interest it could be any point along this trajectory depending on what he is so the first question asks what is the height of the building how can we determine the height of the building so going back to this picture what is the time when the ball was thrown upward from the building that is where it started to leave that's the beginning the initial position so at that point t is equal to zero for this type of trajectory there's three points of interest the beginning the maximum height and just before it hits the ground at point a t is equal to zero we don't know what the time is at point b or point c but we can figure that out later so in order to determine the height of the building we need to evaluate s when t is zero so we just gotta substitute t with zero into that equation so it's gonna be negative 4.9 times zero squared plus nine point eight times zero plus two hundred this is all zero therefore the initial height of the building is 200 units now i didn't really describe what the position is but you can tell based on this number 4.9 if you see that it's going to be in meters per second the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 meters per second squared and this formula comes from this equation h is equal to the initial height or rather you've probably seen it like this in physics y final is equal to y initial plus v y initial t minus one one-half gt squared where g is 9.8 so half of 9.8 will give you 4.9 so since the acceleration is in meters per second squared the height is going to be in meters and the time is in seconds so the height of the building is 200 meters now let's move on to part b what is the initial velocity of the ball to find the initial velocity we need to find the derivative of the position function so the derivative of s of t the position function will give us the velocity function so the derivative of negative 4.9 t squared that's going to be negative 4.9 the derivative of t squared is 2t and the derivative of 98 t is just 98. so v of t is going to be negative 4.9 times 2 is negative 9.8 so it's negative 9.8 t plus 98. now to calculate the initial velocity we need to replace t with zero so it's going to be zero plus 98 so v zero is 98 that's the initial velocity in the y direction now let's move on to part c actually before we do that let's talk about the equations so in physics i mentioned that the height above the ground y final is equal to y initial plus v y initial t minus one half gt squared y initial represents the height of the building it's 200 v y initial is the vertical speed and as you can see it's 98 which is what we have that's the initial vertical speed in the y direction well technically is the initial vertical velocity and then if you see 4.9 that means g is 9.8 and so the units for g is meters per second squared which means this is going to be in meters and the time is in seconds now in calculus you might see a function that looks like this s of t is equal to negative 16 t squared plus v initial t plus that's an issue if this number is negative 4.9 in front of t squared then you know you're dealing with meters and seconds those are the units but if you see negative 16 then you're dealing with feet and seconds because g is about 32 feet per second squared but 9.8 meters per second squared so if you see a negative 16 that means t is in seconds and the height is in feet as opposed to meters now s initial corresponds to this number as you can see that's the height of the building and v initial which is the same as v y initial that's the velocity in the y direction the initial velocity it's always going to be this number in front of t which as you can see is 98 so i want you to see the relationship between these two equations with the height of the building and the initial velocity now let's move on to the next part what is the instantaneous velocity of the ball at t equals five so we have the velocity function and we said it was negative 9.8 t plus 98 so if we plug in a t value this will give us the instantaneous velocity at any time t so to find it at t equals five it's simply going to be negative nine point eight times five plus ninety eight negative 9.8 times 5 is negative 49 and negative 49 plus 98 is positive 49. now what does this number tell us what does it mean when the ball is going up the velocity in the y direction is positive but when it's going down it's negative so at t equals five the ball is somewhere between a and b that means the time it takes to get to point b is higher than five so keep that in mind so right now the ball could be maybe at this position but it's going up so it has a positive velocity but when it's going down it's going to have a negative velocity now let's move on to part d right now i'm going to rewrite this answer to use it as comparison later now what is the average velocity of the ball on the interval four to six to determine the average velocity we need to use the position function what we need to do is we need two points and we need to determine a slope between those two points a secant line touches the curve at two points and so the average velocity can be used to estimate the instantaneous velocity so make sure you understand this the average velocity represents the slope of the secant line the instantaneous velocity represents the slope of the tangent line and both the secant line and the tangent line represents it's a line on the position function not the velocity function so this white line represents the position function i'm going to choose two points at random let's use these two points so this would be a secant line now let's say if i want to estimate the slope of the tangent line here would be now notice that the instantaneous velocity was calculated when t is five and five is in between four and six so you can estimate the instantaneous velocity by calculating the average velocity at two points where this point is the midpoint of those two points just as five is the midpoint between four and six and keep in mind a tangent line only touches the curve at one point the secant line touches it at two points so let's say if we have a curve that looks like this and let's say we want to estimate the slope of the tangent line at that point so we can calculate the slope of the secant line but these two points we need one to be on the left one to go on the right such that this point is the midpoint of these two points as these two points move closer towards the midpoint the slope of the secant line will approach the slope of the tangent line so if we pick two points that are closer to it the slope of this secant line the green line is going to be a lot closer to the slope of this tangent line so let's calculate the average velocity on the interval four to six so the average velocity is going to be s of b minus s of a over b minus a where a is four b is six so it's going to be s of six minus s of four over six minus four and if you average four and six you get five so this is going to approximately be equal to v of five so we should expect an answer that's somewhat close to 49 so s of 6 let's plug it into this formula that's going to be i'm going to do it separately first because of lack of space so it's negative four point nine times six squared plus nine ninety eight rather i was gonna say nine point eight ninety eight times six plus two hundred so i got 611.6 and this is in meters and then s4 let's see what that's going to be so that's 513.6 so this is going to be six eleven point six minus five thirteen point six and six minus four is equal to two six eleven point six minus five thirteen six that's 98 and 98 divided by 2 is 49. it turns out that in this particular instance it was exactly 49. now if we try 4.9 and 5.1 it should be very close to that number as well this could be just a coincidence that it was 49. so there's no need to do this one but you could do it if you want to let's move on to part e how long will it take for the ball to hit the ground so how long will it take for it to reach position c now what is the height at position c the height is zero because it's at ground level so all we need to do is replace s of t with zero and solve for t so zero is equal to negative 4.9 t squared plus 98 t plus 200 if you want to you can multiply everything by negative 1. and so this would be 4.9 t squared minus 98 t minus 200 and then we could use the quadratic formula so it's going to be negative b in this case b is negative 98 so this is a b and c so it's negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4 a c divided by 2a 2 times 4.9 that's going to be 9.8 so this is going to be positive 98 and then we're going to have 98 squared minus 4.9 times 4 times negative 200 and that's going to be 13 524 the square root of thirteen thousand five hundred twenty four is 116.3 now t is not going to be negative because it was zero at a so we need a positive answer so it's going to be 98 plus 116.3 and then divided by 9.8 so it's going to take 21.87 or i'm gonna round into nine 21.9 seconds for the ball to reach the ground now part f how fast is the ball moving before it hits the ground so let's go back to the velocity function v of t is negative 9.8 t plus 98. so we're looking for v of 21.9 or 21.87 so it's negative nine point eight times twenty one point eight seven plus ninety eight so the answer is negative 116.3 meters per second but let's talk about it now the question in part f asks how fast is the ball moving before it hits the ground is it asking for speed or velocity how fast is the measure of speed we are measuring the magnitude not the direction of this quantity so the sign doesn't matter velocity can be positive or negative because direction is important but speed is always positive so how fast it's moving it's going to be positive 16.3 meters per second now if it asks for the velocity then we would use negative 116.3 meters per second but since we're looking for the speed we need to make that answer positive watch out for those questions now what about part g how long will it take for the ball to reach its highest point so at what time will it reach point b how can we figure that out at point b you need to realize that the velocity in the y direction is equal to zero so let's start with the velocity function and we're gonna set v of t equal to zero and let's calculate t so i'm going to move the 98 to the other side so negative 98 is equal to negative 9.8 t if we divide both sides by negative 9.8 then t is going to equal 10. so it takes 10 seconds for the ball to reach to position b now keep in mind this picture is not drawn to scale it looks like the right side is a lot bigger than the left side now part h determine the maximum height of the ball above the ground level now the maximum height occurs at position b that's the highest point so all we need to do is evaluate s when t is zero so it's going to be negative 4.9 times 10 squared plus 98 times 10 plus 200 so 10 squared is 100 times 4.9 that's 490. 98 times 10 is 980 and negative 490 plus 980 that's 490 plus 200 so the maximum height is 690 meters and that's it so now you know how to answer some questions related to position functions average velocity and instantaneous velocity thanks for watching you 

Transcript for: Derivatives of Rational Functions
in this lesson we're going to talk about how to find the derivative of a rational function so let's differentiate 1 over x what is the derivative of 1 over x well first we need to rewrite the expression so this is the same as x to the minus one and now we could use the power rule and recall that the power rule the derivative of x to the n is n x raised to the n minus one so this is going to be n is negative one in this example so it's going to be negative one times x raised to the negative one minus one and negative 1 minus 1 is negative 2 and then you can rewrite it let's move the x back to the bottom so the final answer is negative 1 over x squared now let's work on another example so let's say if we want to find the derivative of one over x plus five so how is this problem different from the last one it's actually very similar so first we need to rewrite the expression i'm going to rewrite it as x plus 5 raised to the minus 1. but i'm going to use the power rule along with the chain rule so first let's use the power rule let's take the exponent and move it to the front so it's going to be negative one and then keep the inside the same and then subtract the exponent by one negative one minus one is negative two and then you're supposed to find the derivative of the inside the derivative of x plus five is one and then if we simplify it if we bring this back to the bottom the final answer is going to be negative one over x plus 5 squared now let's work on some more examples so what if we wanted to find the derivative of 1 over let's say four x minus seven try that one so following the same pattern we're differentiating four x minus seven raised to the negative one so using the chain rule and the power rule we're going to take the exponent move it to the front and then keep the inside expression 4x minus seven the same subtract the exponent by one so this is going to be negative two and then we need to find the derivative of the inside the inside function is 4x minus 7. the derivative of 4x minus 7 is 4. and so it's going to be negative 4 divided by 4x minus 7 squared and so that's the solution for that example i'm going to give you a lot of practice problems in this video so you can master this topic go ahead and find the derivative of 9 divided by x squared minus six so let's begin by rewriting the expression so this is going to be nine and let's move this to the top so 9 times x squared minus 6 raised to the minus 1. so this is going to equal 9 times the derivative of that expression so times negative 1 and then keep the inside function the same and then subtract the exponent by 1 and then multiply by the derivative of the inside function the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of any constant such as negative 6 is 0. so now we're going to multiply negative 1 by 9 which is negative 9 times 2x so that's going to be negative 18x and then this is going to go in the denominator so that's going to be x squared minus 6 and that squared so that's how we could find the derivative of that example go ahead and try this what is the derivative of 12 divided by 4 minus 8x but raised to the fourth power on the bottom go ahead and try that so as always we need to rewrite the expression so this is 12 times 4 minus 8x raised to the negative fourth power and now let's find the derivative so we're going to take the negative 4 move to the front so it's going to be 12 times negative 4 and then keep the inside function the same and then subtract the exponent by 1. negative 4 minus 1 is negative 5. and then take the derivative of the inside function the derivative of four minus eight x is negative eight and now let's multiply so i'm going to use the calculator for this twelve times negative four is negative 48 and negative 48 times negative 8 that's 384 so that's positive and then it's going to be divided by 4 minus 8x raised to the fifth power and that's the answer what about this problem what is the derivative of five minus nine x divided by x squared plus four so here we have another rational function go ahead and differentiate this expression so we need to use the quotient rule because we have a variable in the numerator and the variable in the denominator and we can't simplify this expression so here's the quotient rule the derivative of f divided by g is g f prime minus f of g prime over g squared now let's label what we know f is five minus nine x and g is x squared plus four so f prime the derivative of f that's going to be negative 9 and g prime the derivative of g is 2x so let's go ahead and apply this expression to the problem so first let's start with g g is x squared plus four and then it's multiplied to f prime which is negative nine and then minus f which is five minus nine x times g prime that's two x divided by g squared and g is x squared plus four so let's square that expression so we have to answer right now but what we need to do is simplify what we have let's distribute and combine like terms so let's distribute negative nine to x squared plus four so x squared times negative nine that's negative 9 x squared and 4 times negative 9 is negative 36 now let's do the same with that expression so 5 times 2x is 10x but there's a negative sign so that's going to be negative 10x negative 9x times 2x is negative 18x squared but with a negative sign in front that's going to be positive 18x squared now the only thing that we can do now is add those two so negative 9 plus 18 is not so we have 9x squared minus 10x minus 36 divided by x squared plus 4 squared so i'm going to leave the answer like this that's it let's try this example five minus two x over x plus four raised to the fifth power go ahead and find the derivative of that expression so we have a quotient rule mixed with a chain rule type situation so how can we do that well first let's apply the chain rule so let's move the exponent to the front keep the inside function the same and then subtract the exponent by one and now we need to multiply by the derivative of the inside function and that's when we need to use a quotient rule so f is five minus two x which means f prime is negative two g is x plus four so g prime is the derivative of x which is one and the formula is going to be g f prime minus f g prime over g squared let's see if i can fit that here so g is x plus 4 times f prime which is negative two minus f that's five minus two x and thankfully g prime is one so it's not going to change anything and g squared that's gonna be x plus 4 squared now let's see if we could simplify the expression let's focus on combining like terms here and then i can add everything else around it so x plus four times negative two that's going to be negative two x minus eight and then distribute the negative sign to 5 and a negative 2x that's going to be negative 5 plus 2x well these two will cancel and so we have negative 8 minus 5 which is negative 13. so right now i have 5 times five minus two x over x plus four raised to the fourth power and then times negative thirteen over x plus 4 squared so the first thing i can do is multiply 5 and negative 13. and then we're going to separate these two i'm going to apply the 4 to the 5 minus 2x and the x plus 4. so it's going to be 5 minus 2x to the fourth power and divided by x plus 4 to the fourth power 5 times negative 13 that's negative 65. now the reason why i wanted to separate this four into two different fours is because these two are the same i can multiply them together and so the final answer fully simplified is negative 65 times five minus two x raised to the fourth power divided by x plus four and four plus two is six so that's gonna be to the sixth power and this is it you 

Transcript for: Derivatives of Radical Functions
today we're going to talk about how to find the derivative of radical functions so let's start with something simple what is the derivative of the square root of x go ahead and try that what do you think we need to do here the first thing we need to do is we need to rewrite the expression the square root of x is basically x to the one half the index number is an invisible two and the exponent is a one so for instance let's say if you have the fifth root of x cubed you can rewrite that as x to the three fifths or if you have the seventh root of x to the fourth you can write that as x to the four over seven so you have to rewrite the radical as a rational exponent now we need to apply the power rule and just to review the power rule is the derivative of x to the n is n x raised to the n minus one so we're going to move the one half to the front and so we're gonna have one half x and then it's gonna be one half minus one now we need to get common denominators one is the same as two over two and one minus two is negative one so one over two minus two over two is negative half this is the answer but we still need to simplify so this is equivalent to one x raised to the negative one half divided by two now to make the negative exponent a positive one we'll need to take the variable move it to the bottom so right now this is going to be one over two x but raised to the positive one half as opposed to negative one-half the last thing we need to do is convert the rational exponent back into its radical form so x to the one-half is the square root of x and so this is the final answer now let's talk about how to find the derivative of another similar example and this is going to be the square root of x plus five so first let's rewrite the expression so this is basically x plus five raised to the one half now we need to use the chain rule in addition to the power rule and here's the gist of using the chain rule so basically we have a composite function f of g of x so notice that the inside part of the function g of x is x plus five the outside function f of x is just x to the one half now if you need to find the derivative of a composite function using a chain rule you need to differentiate the outside function and then keep the inside part the same and then multiply by the derivative of the inside function so that's the gist of differentiating composite functions using the chain rule so let's apply that let's differentiate the outside function by using the power rule first so we're going to move the one half to the front and we're going to keep the inside part g of x the same and then we're gonna subtract the exponent by one using the power rule so one half minus one we know it's negative one half and then we'll need to multiply by the derivative of the inside function g of x so the derivative of x plus five is one now we need to simplify our answer so this is going to be it's x plus five raised to the negative one half times one divided by two and now let's move this to the bottom so it's one over two x plus five raised to the negative one half i mean positive one half now and so the final answer is one over two square root x plus five it's very similar to the last problem because this was a one so here's another problem it's actually very similar to the last one just with a few extra details go ahead and find the derivative of the square root of x squared minus four so first rewrite the expression so this is x squared minus 4 raised to the one half now let's use the chain rule so let's bring the exponent to the front keep the inside function the same and then subtract the exponent by one one half minus one is negative one half and then multiply by the derivative of the inside the derivative of the inside function x squared minus four is two x now one half times two is one so we can get rid of the one half and the two now we need to take this term and move it to the bottom so right now what we have is x divided by x squared minus 4 raised to the positive one half now the last thing we need to do is convert the rational exponent into its radical form so the final answer is x divided by the square root of x squared minus four and so that's the solution let's work on another example let's determine the derivative of the cube root of five x plus two feel free to pause the video and try this example the best way to learn is to work through these examples and then you can improve your skill and your understanding of this material so like before let's rewrite the expression so this time we have five x plus two and five x plus two is basically raised to the first power and we have an index of three so this is going to be raised to the one third now like before we're still going to use the chain rule so let's work on the exponents first let's use the power rule so we're going to move the 1 3 to the front and keep the inside function g of x the same and then we're going to subtract the exponent one third by one so one third minus one that's the same as one could be changed to three over three so we need to get common denominators one minus three is negative two so this is going to be negative two thirds and then we need to multiply by g prime the derivative of the inside function so the derivative of five x plus two is five so right now we have a five on top five x plus two raised to the negative two thirds is also in the numerator and the three is in the bottom so now let's take this term move it to the bottom so it's going to be five over three and then five x plus two but raised to the positive two thirds and now let's rewrite it in its radical form so this is going to be the cube root of 5 x plus 2 squared now that's the answer if you want to rationalize the denominator you could if you want to do that his we need to do multiply the bottom and the top by the cube root of 5x plus 2. by the way if you leave your answer like this most teachers will accept the answer unless they specifically state to rationalize any denominator now i need three 5x plus twos i have two of them so i need one more and this will give me the one more that i need so in the numerator i'm going to have 5 times the cube root of 5 x plus 2 and in the denominator i'm going to have 3 times the cube root of five x plus two but i have three of them now now the threes will cancel three divided by three is one so the radical will disappear and the final answer is five cube root five x plus two divided by three times five x plus two and i'm gonna stop here for this problem here's another problem that you could try one over the fourth root of x to the fifth power so first let's rewrite it so this is going to be 1 over x to the 5 over 4 and i'm going to move this to the top so this is x to the negative 5 4. so now we can use the power rule so it's going to be negative 5 over 4 x and then we need to subtract 5 over 4 by 1. so we can rewrite 1 as 4 over 4. negative five minus four is negative nine so this is going to be negative nine over four so what we have is negative five x raised to negative nine over four divided by four and now let's move the variable to the bottom of the fraction so it's negative five over four x to the positive nine over four and now let's convert the rational exponent into a radical so this is going to be the fourth root of x to the ninth power now we could simplify it so i'm going to rewrite x to the 9 as x to the 8 times x now the fourth root of x to the eight you need to divide eight by four you get two so that's going to be four x squared times the fourth root of x now if you want to rationalize it we need four x variables to be inside of this fraction i mean not the fraction but inside the radical so i'm going to multiply the top and the bottom by the fourth root of x cubed whatever you do to the top you must always do to the bottom so in the numerator i have negative five times the four fruit of x cubed in the denominator i have four x squared times the fourth root of one plus three is four so x to the four and then if i divide four by four that's going to give me one so then this is negative five times the four root of x cubed over four x squared times x so the final answer is negative five fourth root of x cubed over four x cubed that's it now let's try one more example so let's go ahead and find the derivative of eight divided by the seventh root of three minus two x raised to the fourth power so go ahead and try that now first we need to rewrite it so let's convert the radical into a rational exponent so it's 3 minus 2x and it's going to be raised to the 4 over 7. and then we need to take this expression move it to the top so we have the derivative of eight times three minus two x raised to the four over seven so now let's use the chain rule and the constant multiple rule so it's gonna be eight that's the constant times the derivative of this expression so let's move the exponent to the front keep the inside function the same and then subtract the exponent by one so four over seven minus 1 that's going to be 4 over 7 minus 7 over 7 which is negative 3 over 7. and then we need to multiply by the derivative of the inside function so the derivative of three minus two x is negative two so now let's simplify so we have four times negative two that's negative eight times eight so that's going to be negative 64. and it's divided by seven now in the numerator we still have three minus two x to the negative three over the seventh power and so let's take that move it to the bottom and so that's negative 64 divided by seven times three minus two x raised to the three over seven and then let's convert it back into its radical form so it's going to be the seventh root of three minus two x to the third power now if you wish to rationalize it we need to multiply the top and bottom by the seventh root of three minus two x but raised to the fourth power since we already have three of them and we need to get to seven so it's going to be negative 64 times the seventh root of three minus two x to the fourth power divided by seven and then times the seventh root of three minus two x to the seventh power so these will cancel and now we're going to get the final answer and that's it you 

Transcript for: How To Find The Derivative of a Fraction - Calculus
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the derivative of a fraction but before we do that we need to go over some basic rules such as the power rule the derivative of a variable raised to a constant x is the variable n is the constant it's going to be n times x raised to the n minus 1. so let me give you some examples let's say if we want to find the derivative of x squared it's going to be 2 x and then subtract this by 1 so 2x to the first power if we want to take the derivative of x cubed it's going to be 3 x to the second power pretty much you move the exponent to the front and then subtract it by one likewise if we want to find the derivative of x to the fourth power is 4 x cubed now what if we want to find the derivative of let's say 8 x to the ninth power what you could do is move the constants to the front this is equivalent to saying 8 times the derivative of x to the 9th power and then using the power rule the derivative of x to the 9th power will be 9 x to the 8th and then you can multiply the 8 and the nine so eight times nine is seventy two so that's the answer for this example so let's say if we wanna find the derivative of five x to the sixth it's going to be five times the derivative of x to the sixth power which is six x to the fifth power and we're gonna get 30 x to the fifth now what if we want to find the derivative of let's say 7x what's the answer for that one well keep in mind this is x to the first power so it's going to be 7 times the derivative of x to the first power which is one x to the zero power and anything raised to the zero power is one so the answer is just seven so the derivative of five x is simply five the derivative of negative four x is simply negative four following that same pattern now the last thing you need to be familiar with is that the derivative of a constant is zero so the derivative of let's say negative six that's going to be zero so now that we had a quick review of some of the basic stuff let's go over finding the derivative of a fraction so let's say we want to find the derivative of x over nine how can we do this well it helps if you rewrite the fraction this is the same as the 9 is a constant so you could say this is the same as 1 over 9 times the derivative of x because 1 over 9 times x is x over nine and the derivative of x is simply one keep in mind the derivative of five x is five two x is two one x is one so the answer for this example it's simply one over nine now what about this one what is the derivative of four x over seven so this is the same as four over seven times the derivative of x so it's just four over seven times one or simply four over seven so that's what you can do if x is in the numerator but what if x is in the denominator of the fraction let's say we have the derivative of 8 over x well in this case the situation is different if you see this what you need to do is you need to rewrite the expression you need to move the x to the top of the fraction so this is the same as the derivative of eight times x raised to the minus one and now we could use the power rule we can move the exponent to the front and so it becomes eight times negative one or negative eight and then x and then subtract this by one negative 1 minus 1 is negative 2. so this is the answer but we want to get rid of the negative exponents so what we're going to do is we're going to move x back to the bottom and the negative exponent is going to become positive so we're going to get negative 8 over x squared so this is the final answer for this example let's try a similar example let's find the derivative of 7 over x squared feel free to pause the video if you want to try that problem so let's begin by rewriting the expression so this is equivalent to saying the derivative of seven times x to the minus two now we could use the power rule so it's going to be seven times the derivative of this thing the derivative of x to the minus 2 is negative 2 x and then if you subtract negative 2 by 1 you're going to get negative 3. next we can multiply 7 and negative 2 that's negative 14. and then we're going to move the negative 3 to the bottom so the answer is going to be negative 14 over x cubed here's another one let's find the derivative of eight over x to the third power so once again let's rewrite the expression so this is the same as finding the derivative of eight x to the minus three now the derivative of x to the minus three is going to be negative three times x raised to the negative four and then 8 times negative 3 is negative 24. now moving the x variable to the bottom this is going to give us the final answer negative 24 over x to the fourth power now what about this problem what is the derivative of let's say the square root of x over five so what would you do if you have a square root in the numerator of a fraction well first we want to rewrite the expression this is the same as the derivative of one over five times the square root of x is the same as x to the one-half so that's going to be one over five times the derivative of x to the one-half now let's use the power rule first we're going to move this to the front and then we're going to subtract one half by one so one half minus one we could change the negative one to two over two to get common denominators and then one minus two is negative one so one half minus one is negative one half and now we can multiply one over five by one over two so five times two is ten so we're going to get one over ten x to the minus one half which you can write that as x to the negative one half over ten you could just multiply those two together now we wanna get rid of the negative exponent to do that we need to move the variable x to the bottom so our answer is 1 over 10 x to the one-half now even though this is the correct answer it's not in its most simplified form because we need to convert it back to its radical form keep in mind x to the one-half is equivalent to the square root of x so we can write our final answer as one over ten square root of x now you can rationalize this answer but i'm going to leave it like this now let's work on a similar but slightly different problem so in this example we're going to find the derivative of 7 divided by the square root of x feel free to take a minute to try that problem so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to rewrite the problem the square root of x is the same as x to the one-half next we need to move the x variable to the top before we can use the product rule i mean not the product rule but the power rule so we have the derivative of seven times x to the negative one half so now we're going to move the negative one-half to the front and then subtract negative one-half by one let's change negative one to negative two over two just like we did before and now negative one minus two is negative three so negative one half minus one is negative three over two now let's see if we can combine this answer into a single fraction the 7 and the negative sign are on top of the fraction the 2 is on the bottom and since this fraction is multiplied by x it's automatically going to put the x on top now the next thing we need to do is get rid of the negative exponent by moving the x variable back to the bottom so this is what we now have next what we can do is get rid of we can convert this back into its radical form but it's important to understand that x to the three half can be rewritten as x to the one half times x to the first power because a half plus one is three halves or point five plus one is three over two which is one point five and x to the one half is equal to the square root of x so we can replace x to the three half with x root x so we can write the final answer as negative 7 to x times the square root of x so that's it for this problem now let's work on one more problem go ahead and find the derivative of this fraction five plus three x divided by x squared plus seven now for problems like this you need to use something called the quotient rule and here's the formula for that the derivative of a fraction f over g that's going to be equal to g f prime minus f g prime over g squared some books would use the variables u and v so in this case we need to define what f and what g is so f is the stuff in the numerator that's 5 plus 3x f prime is the derivative of that expression the derivative of a constant is zero and the derivative of three x is just three now g is the function on the bottom is the stuff in the denominator of the fraction to find g prime we need to find the derivative of x squared which is 2x and the derivative of 7 is 0. so now we just got to plug everything in to this formula so it's a g which is x squared plus seven times f prime which is three minus f which is five plus three x times g prime which is two x divided by g squared so that's x squared plus 7 squared so at this point we can get rid of this information and now we just got to simplify this expression so let's distribute the 3. so first we're going to have 3x squared and then 3 times 7 is 21. next we're going to have 2x times 5 which is 10x but we have a negative sign in front of that so that's going to be negative 10x and then 2x times 3x that's 6x squared and we still got the negative sign so it's a negative 6x squared it's always good just to double check your work to make sure that everything was done correctly now the part on the bottom i'm going to leave it the way it is i'm not going to foil it at this point all we can do right now is combine like terms chances are we probably won't be able to factor it but it's going to check to see if you could factor in but right now i have negative 3x squared minus 10x plus 21 divided by x squared plus 7 squared so just to check to see if we can factor it if we multiply the leading coefficient by the constant term that's going to be 63 or negative 63 rata and we need to find two numbers that multiply to negative 63 but add to negative 10. i mean 9 and 7 multiplies to 63 but it's not going to add to 10. and then you have 21 and 3. that's definitely not going to add to 10. and that's about it so this expression is not factorable which means we can leave our answer like this this is going to be the final answer for this problem so that's it for this video now you know how to find the derivative of a fraction 

Transcript for: Product Rule For Derivatives
in this lesson we're going to go over the product rule for derivatives so let's say if we have a function f multiplied by another function g the derivative of f times g is going to be f prime g plus f of g prime so let me give an example let's say if we want to find the derivative of x squared sine x so notice that f is basically x squared and g is sine x so let's write f is equal to x squared and g is equal to sine x now what is the derivative of x squared the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of sine x is cosine x so now all we need to do is plug in what we have into that expression so f prime is 2x times g which is sine x plus f which is x squared and then g prime is cosine x and so that's the answer now if you want to you can factor out the gcf which is x so if i take out an x i'll be left with 2 sine x plus x cosine x if you want to simplify now let's try another example go ahead and differentiate this expression 5x minus 9x cubed times eight plus x squared go ahead and find the derivative of this entire expression so let's say that f of x is five x minus 9x cubed and g is going to be the other function a plus x squared so first we need to find f prime which is the derivative of 5x is 5 and the derivative of nine x cubed that's going to be nine times three x squared which is 27 x squared now for g prime the derivative of a constant is zero and the derivative of x squared is 2x according to the power rule so using the expression the derivative of f times g is equal to the derivative of the first part f prime times the second part plus the first part times the derivative of the second so f prime that's 5 minus 27 x squared and g is eight plus x squared plus f which is five x minus nine x cubed and then g prime is two x and so this is the answer now let's try an example with trig functions so let's say f of x is 4 sine x tangent x go ahead and find the first derivative of the function now it's good to separate it into two parts this is the first part and you can call that f if you want and then this is g the second part so to differentiate it we need to find the derivative of the first part of the function the derivative of 4 sine x is 4 cosine x now the second part g we're not going to change it and then plus we're going to keep the first part the same but we're going to find the derivative of the second part the derivative of tangent is secant squared so as you can see this is f prime this is g g was not change let's say this is f and g and then f is unchanged here and then that's g prime so now we need to simplify the expression tangent is sine divided by cosine secant squared is one over cosine squared so there's not much that we could change but for now i'm gonna just write it as one over cosine squared so i can cancel cosine on the left so i have four times sine x you know what i'm going to leave it as four sine x secant squared because i can take out a four sine x and so i'm left with one plus secant squared and i'm going to stop here so that's f prime that's the first derivative of 4 sine x tangent x now let's move on to the next example so let's say f x is 5x sine x minus x cubed tangent x go ahead and find the first derivative of this function now we need to use the product rule on this term and on this term separately so for 5x sine x we can say 5x is like f and sine x can represent g now for the second one x cubed can be f and g could be tangent x you know what let's call this h so we don't confuse it with the other f so let's determine h prime of x so let's differentiate the first part of the function the derivative of 5x is 5 and then leave the second part the way it is and then plus keep the first part the same that's going to be f times g prime so differentiate the second part the derivative of sine is cosine now let's apply the product rule to this expression so let's enclose it in brackets the derivative of the first part x cube is three x squared and then leave the second part the way it is plus keep the first part the same and differentiate the second part the derivative of tangent is secant squared so don't forget to distribute the negative sign to everything so we have five sine x plus five x cosine x minus three x squared tangent x plus x cubed secant squared now there's nothing else that we can do with this problem so we're going to leave it the way it is oh i almost made a mistake this should be a negative sign we need to distribute that negative so this is the answer now let's say if r of x is equal to x squared plus 6 times 7 minus 8x plus 3x x cubed what's r prime of x in this example in this problem we have three factors instead of two so how can we use the product rule when we have three factors we can call this f g and h so what is the derivative of f times g times h so what you need to do is differentiate the first part f and leave the other two the same and then differentiate the middle part g leaving f and h to the same way and then differentiate the last part h so r prime of x is going to equal the derivative of the first part the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of a constant is zero so f prime is just 2x and then we're going to rewrite g and h plus we're going to rewrite f and then times g prime the derivative of 7 minus eight x is simply negative eight and then times h which i'm running out of space and then plus f which is going to stay the same and then g is going to stay the same times h prime which is 3 minus 15 x squared so this is the answer there's no need to simplify at this point unless you can but i will leave it the way it is now let's say if f of 3 is equal to 4 and f prime of 3 is negative 7 and g of three is negative eight and g prime of three is five what is f g prime of three how can we evaluate that expression well we know that the derivative of f times g that's equal to f prime g plus f g prime so if it's f g prime evaluated when x is 3 this is going to be f prime of 3 times g of 3 plus f of 3 times g prime of 3. so all we need to do is plug it into the expression on the right side so f prime of three is negative seven and g of three that's negative eight f of three is four and g prime of three is five negative seven times negative eight that's positive fifty-six four times five is twenty and fifty-six plus twenty is seventy-six and that's all you need to do in order to evaluate something that looks like this f g prime of three now you might be given this information in table form so you can still apply the same principle to evaluate it so that's it for this video that's all i got thanks again for watching you

what is the derivative of x squared times sine x times ln x what do you think the answer is to that question well in this video we're going to talk about how to do that now you need to be familiar with something called the product rule the derivative of f times g is equal to f prime times g plus f times g prime so that's if we have two things multiplied to each other but here this problem has three components multiplied to each other three different functions so the formula is going to be a little different we want to find the derivative of f times g times h so we need to do is take the derivative of the first part f which is f prime and then you're going to multiply by the two other components g and h next we're going to take the derivative of the second part g leaving the other two functions the same so it's going to be f times g prime times h for the last part we're just going to differentiate the last function h leaving the first two the same so it's going to be f times g times h prime so that's the formula that we want to use in order to find the derivative of this function so at this point what we want to do is identify what f g and h are so f is going to be let me write that here f is going to be x squared g is going to be sine x and h will be the natural log of x so now let's find f prime the derivative of x squared is going to be 2x as for g prime the derivative of sine is cosine and as for h prime the derivative of the natural log of x is 1 over x now for those of you who might not know these things if you need a review of derivatives i'm going to post a link in the description section below where you can review the derivative of trigonometric functions natural logs and how to use the power rule so feel free to take a look at that if you need to review that but let's continue with this problem so now all we need to do is plug in these values into this expression so the derivative of this function is going to be f prime which is 2x times g which is sine x times h that's ln x plus f that's x squared times g prime which is cosine x times h which is ln x and then we have f g times h prime which is 1 over x now this is our answer but we can simplify it a bit x squared times one over x which is x squared divided by x that's simply x so this term reduces to x sine x the last thing that we could do is we can factor out an x because we have it in each term so if we want to we can write our answer like this x and then times 2 sine x ln x plus x cosine x ln x and then plus sine x and that's as far as we can go with this problem that's all we can do so now you know how to use the triple product rule when you have a derivative problem that looks like this so that's basically it for this video that is the end of the lesson now if you haven't done so already don't forget to subscribe to this channel also when you get a chance take a look at the description section below in this video the reason for that is i'm going to post some links where you could find more problems on derivatives such as derivatives of exponential functions logarithmic differentiation product rule chain rule quotient rule and other things that you might be tested on that relates to this topic so feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance and thanks again for watching 

Transcript for: Product Rule With 4 Functions - Derivatives | Calculus
consider this problem what is the derivative of x squared times sine x times e to the 4x times the natural log of x so we have a product of four terms how do we find the derivative of that well we need to use the product rule i'm sure you've seen this equation the derivative of f times g let's say if we have two terms it's going to be f prime g plus f g prime you take the derivative of the first part leaving the second part the same and then you leave the first part the same taking the derivative of the second part so what about if we have three terms let's say if we want to find the derivative of f times g times h so what we would do is take the derivative of the first part f prime leaving the other two parts the same next we would take the derivative of the second part leaving the first and the third part the same and then finally we will take the derivative of the last part so for four terms we're going to follow a similar pattern let's say we have the derivative of f times g times h and then going in alphabetical order let's say times i so it's going to be f prime g h i plus f g prime h i plus f g h prime times i and then finally plus f g h i prime so we're going to use this formula to find the derivative of the expression so let's go ahead and begin so let's begin with the derivative of x squared what is the derivative of x squared well we have a variable raised to a constant x raised to n using the power rule it's going to be n times x raised to the n minus 1. so it's going to be 2x raised to the first power or simply 2x the other three parts we're going to leave it the same so it's going to be 2x times sine x times e to the 4x times the natural log of x now let's move on to the next term so we're going to keep the first one the same x squared and then we're going to find the derivative of sine x the derivative of sine x that's going to be cosine x and then the remaining two parts we're gonna leave it the same e to the x times the natural log of x i mean that should be e to the four x and then plus now we're gonna take the derivative of e to the 4x and here's the formula for that the derivative of e raised to the u with respect to x is going to be e to the u times the derivative of u which is u prime so the first two parts will remain the same that's going to be x squared times sine x and then we're going to write the derivative of e to the 4x which is going to be e to the 4x times the derivative of 4x which is 4. and then times the last part which is the natural log of x now for the last term we're going to rewrite the first three terms x squared sine x times e to the four x now we need to find the derivative of the natural log of x and here's the formula for that the derivative of the natural log of u where u is a function of x it's going to be u prime divided by u so u is x the derivative of x is 1 divided by u which is x that's 1 over x so the derivative of not the natural log of x is 1 over x now let's see what we can do to simplify this expression the first thing we can do is factor out the gcf the greatest common factor which is e to the 4x because it's found in all four terms so taking out e to the 4x we're going to be left with everything here except e to the 4x so that's going to be 2x sine x times ln x and then for the next term we're going to have x squared cosine x ln x and then for the next term we're going to have everything but e to the 4x so it's going to be plus 4x squared sine x ln x and for the last one x squared divided by x is just x so we're going to have plus x sine x so this here is the final answer and that's as far as we could simplify it so now you know how to use the product rule when you have a product of four terms or four functions so that's it for this video thanks again for watching 

Transcript for: Quotient Rule For Derivatives
let's say if we want to find the derivative of this function seven x plus four divided by x squared plus five how can we do so how can we find the derivative of a function in a fraction so we need to use something called the quotient rule and here's the formula that you need to be familiar with the derivative of f divided by g is equal to g times f prime minus f times g prime divided by g squared so f is the numerator of the fraction and g is the denominator so we could say that f is equal to seven x plus four and g is equal to x squared plus five so what's f prime and what's g prime f prime the derivative of f that's going to be the derivative of seven x plus four the derivative of seven x is just seven and the derivative of any constant is zero now for g prime the derivative of x squared plus 5 is 2x so using this formula this is going to be equal to g where g is x squared plus 5. multiplied by f prime and so that's seven and then minus f which is seven x plus four times g prime which is 2x divided by g squared and g squared is x squared plus 5 but squared so now let's get rid of this now some teachers will allow you to leave your answer like this because this represents the derivative of this expression other teachers will want you to go further and simplify it so we're going to do that in this example let's distribute the seven so x squared times seven is seven x squared and then we have seven times five which is thirty five now two x times negative 7x that's negative 14 x squared and then we have 2x times 4 with the negative sign in front so that's negative 8x divided by this so now let's combine like terms 7x squared minus 14x squared that's negative 7 x squared and then we have negative 8x plus 35 divided by x squared plus 5 squared and so this is the answer to the problem so that's how you can use the quotient rule to find the derivative of common expressions in the form of a fraction let's try a similar example go ahead and find the derivative of x squared divided by x minus five so feel free to take a minute pause the video and give this problem a shot so let's identify f and g so f is going to be the numerator of the fraction which is x squared and g is going to be the denominator x minus 5. so f prime the derivative of x squared that's going to be 2x and then g prime the derivative of x which is 1 and the derivative of negative 5 is 0. so g prime is 1. now i'm going to rewrite the formula so the derivative of f over g is going to be g f prime minus f of g prime over g squared now let's go ahead and apply it so g in this example is x minus five f prime that's 2x and then minus f is still x squared and then g prime that's 1 divided by g squared or x minus 5 squared so now let's simplify let's distribute 2x to x minus 5. so x times 2x is 2x squared negative 5 times 2x is negative 10x and then we have negative x squared two x squared minus x squared is one x squared so the final answer is x squared minus ten x divided by x minus five squared you could leave your answer like this if you want to or you could also take out the gcf in the numerator which is x so you could write your answer like this x times x minus 10 divided by x minus 5 squared if you want to factor it completely so both answers are acceptable let's try another example so let's say if we have sine x divided by x use the quotient rule to find the derivative of that expression so let's write the formula first so we know it's going to be g f prime minus f g prime over g squared this helps you to prevent making mistakes now let's define what f and g are f is going to be sine x and g is x f prime what is the derivative of sine x the derivative of sine is cosine as for g prime the derivative of x is one so now let's use the formula so it's going to be g which is x times f prime so that's cosine x minus f which is sine x and g prime is one divided by g squared or x squared now for this problem that's basically it there's not much we can do in terms of simplification so the final answer is simply x cosine x minus sine x all divided by x squared and so that's it for this problem the derivative of tangent x is equal to secant squared go ahead and use the quotient rule to prove that the derivative of tangent is secant squared now tangent is sine divided by cosine so we have a fraction so f in this example is sine x g is cosine now f prime the derivative of sine that's cosine and what's the derivative of cosine x the derivative of cosine is negative sine so using the formula the derivative of f over g as always is going to be g f prime minus f g prime over g squared so g is cosine x f prime is also cosine x minus f which is sine x times g prime and that's negative sine x now g squared that's going to be cosine squared now let's see what we can do to simplify this expression cosine x times cosine x is cosine squared x negative sine x times another negative sine x that's going to be positive sine squared this is all divided by cosine squared which we can write like that if we want to now what is cosine squared plus sine squared that's another trigonometric identity cosine squared plus sine squared is equal to one and one over cosine is secant so one divided by cosine squared is secant squared and that's how you can show that the derivative of tangent is secant squared you can do so by using the quotient rule but you got to convert it from tangent to sine over cosine the derivative of secant x is secant tangent x go ahead and use the quotient rule to prove this statement now secant is one over cosine so how can we show that the derivative of one over cosine is secant tangent well let's define f and g so f is going to be the numerator f is one g is going to be cosine x f prime the derivative of one is zero and the derivative of cosine is negative sine so using the formula it's going to be g f prime minus f of g prime over g squared so g is cosine x and then f prime is zero minus f which is one times g prime that's negative sine x all divided by g squared or cosine x squared cosine times zero is zero so that's going to disappear and we're gonna have negative one times negative sine x which is positive sine x all divided by cosine squared now i'm going to rewrite this as 1 over cosine x times sine over cosine so these expressions are the same because one times sine is still sine and cosine times cosine is still cosine squared now the reason why it's separated this way is because one over cosine will give me secant x and sine over cosine is tangent x so that's how you can show that the derivative of secant is secant tangent using the quotient rule 

Transcript for: The Reciprocal Rule and The Quotient Rule - Derivative Calculus
in this lesson we're going to talk about the reciprocal rule so here's the basic idea behind the reciprocal rule the derivative of 1 over f of x and that's equal to negative times the derivative of f divided by the square of f of x now the reciprocal rule comes from the quotient rule in fact you can derive it from the quotient rule so here's the quotient rule U over V the derivative of that is equal to v u Prime minus u v Prime over V squared so if we want to differentiate one over f using the quotient rule we can see that U is going to be equal to one and F I mean V is equivalent to f so U Prime the derivative of one is zero and V Prime the derivative of f is going to be F Prime so v u Prime V is f u Prime is zero minus u v Prime U is one V Prime is f Prime divided by V squared V is f so V squared is f squared now zero times f is zero so that disappears and we're left with negative f Prime over F squared which is basically what we have here so that's how you can prove the reciprocal rule from the quotient rule so let's write a simplified version of it so here's the reciprocal rule 1 over F Prime is going to be F Prime negative f Prime over F squared so that's the simplified version of the reciprocal rule now let's work on an example problem so let's find the derivative of 1 over 5x squared so go ahead and differentiate that expression using the reciprocal rule feel free to pause the video if you want to so in this problem f is 5X squared F Prime the derivative of 5x squared that's going to be 5. times the derivative of x squared which is 2x so that simplifies to 10x so using the formula it's negative f Prime so negative 10x divided by F squared f is 5X squared and if we Square it this is going to be negative 10x 5 squared is 25 x squared squared that's going to be x to the fourth so we could simplify that so 10 is 5 times 2 25 is 5 times 5. x to the fourth is x times x cubed so we could cancel a 5. and we can cross out an X so this simplifies to negative two over five x cubed so that's going to be the answer for this problem now we can get that same answer using the power rule so the derivative of 1 over 5x squared well that's equivalent to the derivative of one-fifth x to the negative 2. if we take x squared and move it to the top now we could use the power rule the derivative of a variable raised to the constant x to the N is going to be n x to the N minus 1. so this is going to be 1 over 5. n is negative 2 so this is going to be times n times negative 2 and then X negative 2 minus 1 which is negative 3. so the negative 2 is going to go on top of the fraction the 5 is going to stay on the bottom so we have negative 2 over five now x to the negative 3 Once you put it to the bottom it's going to become x to the positive 3. and notice that we get the same answer Now using the power rule we could get the answer a lot faster but nevertheless the reciprocal rule works as well so it gives us the same answer now for the sake of practice let's work on a few more examples but using the reciprocal rule so go ahead and find the derivative of these expressions so let's say we have 1 over actually let's make this 4 over x squared plus 3x and for this one let's say five over lnx go ahead and try those two examples so this expression is equivalent to saying 4 times the derivative of 1 over x squared plus 3x now F in that problem is going to be x squared plus 3x which means F Prime is going to be the derivative of x squared is 2x the derivative of 3x is just 3. so it's negative f Prime so that's negative two X plus three divided by F squared so that's x squared plus 3x squared now there's really no need to simplify this expression I'm not going to foil it because it's going to become more complicated so I'm going to leave the answer just like this it looks nicely simplified the way it is already now for the next one I'm going to rewrite this as 5. oh wait before I finish that I need to include the 4 here almost forgot so I'm just going to put that 4 right there so that's the final answer with the four included now for the next one I'm going to move the constant 5 to the front so we're differentiating 1 over Ln X so f is Ln X F Prime the derivative of L and X is 1 over X when you differentiate outline U it's U Prime over U so Ln X would be the derivative of x which is 1 divided by X so it's 1 over X Now using the formula this is going to be 5 times negative f so that's negative 1 over X divided by F squared or Ln x squared now I'm going to multiply the top and bottom by X to simplify this so 1 over x and x will cancel therefore the final answer will be negative 5. over X Ln X squared so that's basically it for this video now you know how to use the reciprocal rule in order to differentiate functions that look like this where you have the variable in the bottom of the fraction so it's a lot easier than using the quotient rule but you could use the quotient rule for any of these problems but if you don't have a variable on the top it's easier to use the reciprocal rule by the way for those of you who want more examples on derivatives and other topics like that feel free to check out

Transcript for: Chain Rule For Finding Derivatives
let's move on to the chain rule we're going to cover a lot of examples the first Formula you need to be familiar with is the derivative of the composite function f of g ofx a composite function is one where you have one function inside of another notice that g is inside of f which makes it a composite function so the first thing you need to do is differentiate the outside portion of the function that is f and you need to keep the inside the same and then multiply it by the derivative of the inside that's the main idea behind the chain rule if you follow this process you're going to get the answer right so let's say for example if we have a function U raised to the N where U is another function in terms of X using the chain Rule and the power rule combined it's going to be n * U you have to keep that the same raised to the N minus one times the derivative of what's on the inside that's the general power rule formula with the chain rule combine so never forget to multiply by the derivative of the inside function so let's use an example let's say if we want to find the derivative of 5x + 3 raised to the 4th power so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to move the constant I mean the exponent to the front so it's going to be four and then keep the inside stuff the same * 5x + 3 subtract the exponent by 1 4 - 1 is 3 and then multiply by the derivative of the inside the inside function is four it's 5x + 3 the derivative of 5x + 3 is just 5 and so that's the answer we can multiply four and 5 that's going to give us 20 so it's 20 * 5x + 3 ra the thir power so that's the final answer fully simplified now let's work on some more examples find the derivative of x^2 - 3x raised to the 5th power so first let's bring down to five so it's going to be five and then keep the inside function the same and then subtract the exponent by 1 so this is four and then multiply by the derivative of the inside the derivative of x^2 - 3x is 2x - 3 and so that's the answer once you get used to the process it's not that bad here's another example that you can try find the derivative of s of 6X the derivative of the outside part of the function s is cosine and you got to keep the inside function the same then you multiply by the derivative of the inside function the derivative of 6X is 6 so the answer is simply 6 cosine 6X now what is the derivative of cosine x^2 so first differentiate the outside part of the function cosine the derivative of cosine is negative sign now the inside part of the function has to remain the same that is the angle of cosine so it's going to be x^2 and then differentiate the inside function x^2 which is 2x so basically you're working away from the outside towards the inside the final answer is -2X sin X2 find the derivative of tangent X CU so first let's differentiate tangent the derivative of tangent is secant squ and the inside function has to remain the same next differentiate the inside function X Cub so that's 3x^2 and it's always multiplication so it's going to be 3x^2 secant 2 x Cub as you can see it's not that bad here's another problem what is the derivative of secant 4X the derivative of secant 4X is going to be secant tangent that's the derivative of secant now the inside function has to remain the same for secant and tangent next we need to differentiate 4X so it's just going to be time4 and so that's the solution what is the derivative of Ln X raised to the 7th power try that problem so this is going to be S keep the inside part the same and then subtract the exponent by one so 7 - 1 is 6 now we got to multiply by the derivative of the inside function the derivative of Ln X is simply 1 /x so the final answer is 7 Ln X raised to 6 power / X What is the dtive of theun of XB - 7 take a minute and work on that example the first thing I would do is rewrite it so this is the same as X Cub - 7 raised to the 12 and so that's going to be equal to2 we got to bring the exponent to the front keep the inside function the same and then subtract the exponent by one 1 12 - 1 which is 12 - 2 2 that's a half and then we got to multiply by the derivative of the inside the derivative of x Cub - 7 is simply 3x^2 so we could bring this back to the bottom since it has a negative exponent so it's 3x^2 / we have a two on the bottom 2 XB - 7 and now the exponent is going to change from negative half to positive half and now we could put it back in its radical form so it's 3x^2 / 2 < TK XB - 7 and so that's the final answer for this problem find the derivative of 1 / x^2 + 8 raised to the 3 power so first let's rewrite the expression let's bring the variables to the top so this is is x^2 + 8 raed Theus 3 and now we can use the chain rule combined with the power rule let's move the3 to the front and let's keep the inside function let's rewrite it exactly the way we see it and then let's subtract this by 1 -3 - 1 is4 and now let's multiply by the derivative of the inside function which is 2x so now let's take this term move it back to the bottom so we have -3 * 2x which is -6x on top and on the bottom it's x^2 + 8 raised to the 4th power and so that's all we need to do for this problem so for some examples you need to rewrite it before you find the derivative now what if we have a trig function inside another trig function find the Der of this uh function so first we need to differentiate the outside function s the derivative of s is cosine now what's inside of cosine since cosine came from s everything inside of s is going to be the stuff inside of cosine so that's tangent X 4th now let's move on to tangent the derivative of tangent is secant squ and the stuff that's inside of tangent is going to be the stuff that's inside of secant squ so that's x 4 and then we got to move on further towards the inside the derivative of x 4th is 4X cub and so that's the answer how about this example find the derivative of s raised to the 5th power tangent cosine X cub the first thing I would do is rewrite the expression so this is s tangent cosine XB all rais the 5th power so first let's deal with the exponents let's use the power rule so we got to bring the five to the front and keep everything inside the same so always start with the outside portion of the function which is going to be the exponents in this case and then subtract the exponent by one so it's going to be four now let's work our way towards the inside so we got a differentiate sign the derivative of s is cosine and the stuff inside of s is tan cosine X Cub so we got to put that here now let's move on to tangent the derivative of tangent is secant squ and the stuff inside of tan is cosine X cub so hopefully you're seeing a pattern with the way we're finding the derivative of everything so now that we're done with Tangent let's move on to cosine the derivative of cosine is negative sign and the angle of cosine is X Cub so that's going to be the same here and then let's move on to X Cub the derivative of x Cub is 3x2 so that's the answer and then you can combine terms you can multiply five and three to get 15 what is the derivative of cosine raised to the 7th power of s of secant x^2 so try that problem so first let's rewrite it as cosine of s of secant x^2 and let's put the seven and it's exponent position so let's use the power rule let's bring the seven to the front and let's keep everything on the inside the same and then subtract the exponent by one so this is going to be six now let's find the derivative of cosine let's work our way towards the inside the derivative of cosine is negative sign and the stuff inside of that is s secant X2 so now we got to find the Der ative of s the derivative of s is cosine and the stuff inside of s is secant x^2 so now we got to find the derivative of secant so that's secant tangent so it's going to be secant x^2 tangent x^2 and the derivative of x^2 is 2x so whenever you have multiple composite functions just work your way from the outside towards the inside and everything is multiplied by each other and then when you're done simply collect terms so we have a seven a 2X and a negative so you can move that to the front and write it as -4x if you want to here's the next problem find the derivative of x Cub * 4x + 5 raised to the 4th power so what we have here is a product rule we could say that this is f and this is G and for G we have to use the quotient rule I mean not the quotient rule but the chain rule so using the product rule we need to differentiate the first part F the derivative of the first part is 3x^2 and we need to keep the second part the same so we just have to rewrite G plus now we need to keep the first part the same now for the second part we need to use the chain room so let's bring the four to the front let's keep the inside stuff the same and subtract the four by one then multiply by the derivative of the inside function which is 4x + 5 the derivative of that is four so now let's simplify so the first part we don't really need to change anything we can just leave it like this now for the second part we can multiply four and four that's 16 so this is 16 x Cub * 4x + 5 raised to the thir power you can leave your answer like this or if you want to you can take out the GCF we can take out an x s and we could take out three 4x+ 5S or basically 4x + 5 to the third power so this is gone we took three of these one is left over and we have a a three left so this is going to be a 3 * 4x + 5 and this is gone we took out all three of these well there's an X left over and it's 16 so plus 16 x because we took out an X squ now what we can do is basically simplify what we have here so this is x^2 4x + 5 to the 3 power and let's distribute the three so 3 * 4X is 12x 3 * 5 is 15 + 16x now let's add 12x and 16x so the final answer is x^2 * 4x + 5 to the 3 power and then 28x + 15 so that's the solution let's try one more example let's find the derivative of 2x - 3 / 4 + 5x X raised to the 4th power so this is a chain Rule and quotient rule problem so first we need to bring the exponent down and keep the stuff on the inside the same and then subtract the exponent by one next we need to multiply by derivative of the inside so that's when we have to use a quotient rule so f is 2x - 3 and G is 4 + 5x frime is 2 G Prime is 4 and the formula for the quotient rule is it's g f Prime minus FG Prime over G ^2 so G is 4 + 5x F Prime is 2 and F is 2x - 3 G Prime is 4 / g^ 2 which is 4 + 5x^2 so as you can see this is a long problem so let's simplify what we have on the right side if we distribute the two it's going to be 8 + 10 x and if we distribute the four it's going to be 8X and then * -3 * 4 that's pos2 / 4 + 5x^2 and then this part is going to be the same so let's simplify the numerator so first we can add 8 and 12 so that's going to be 20 and then 10 x - 8X that's positive 2x / 4 + 5x^2 now this thing we could distribute the three to the numerator and the denominator so we can write it like this if you want 2x - 3 Cub / 4 + 5x^2 the reason why I did that is because I can now combine these two terms this supposed to be Cube not squared so now what we have is 4 * 2x - 3 the 3 power and I'm going to take out a two here so if I take out a two it's going to be a x + 10 over 4 + 5x raised to the fifth power 3 + 2 is 5 so the final answer is eight 4 * 2 is 8 * x + 10 * 2x - 3 to the 3 power / 4 + 5x to the 5th power and so this is the final answer

in this video we're going to talk about how to find the derivative of a few common trigonometric functions that you'll see on a typical homework problem or if you're studying for a test so let's start with this example problem what is the derivative of sine of 2x here's what you could do to find the answer first find the derivative of sine the derivative of sine is cosine now the angle inside of sine will be the same angle of cosine next work your way towards the inside what is the derivative of 2x the derivative of 2x is 2. so you could simply write the final answer as 2 cosine 2x so that's the derivative of sine 2x now let's move on to the next problem what is the derivative of tangent 3x feel free to try that problem and while you're working on that i'm going to write another one find the derivative of cosine 4x so let's start with the first one first we need to find the derivative of tangent the derivative of tangent is secant squared and the angle is going to be the same whatever you see inside here that needs to go in there next we need to find the derivative of the inside function 3x the derivative of 3x is 3 so the answer is going to be 3 secant squared 3x now let's move on to the next example what is the derivative of cosine the derivative of cosine is negative sine we're going to keep the angle the same and then the derivative of 4x is 4. so the final answer is negative 4 sine 4x now let's work on some harder problems let's say we want to find the derivative of sine squared of 2x how can we do so what would you recommend that we do in this problem the first thing that i would recommend doing is rewriting the problem like this this expression is equal to sine of 2x raised to the second power in order to differentiate that expression we need to work with the outside function more specifically the exponents so when you differentiate x squared it becomes 2 x to the first power we're going to do something similar here so we're going to move the 2 to the front we're going to keep the inside part the same so we're going to be right side of 2x and then we're going to subtract the exponent by 1. 2 minus 1 is 1. next we can work our way towards the inside the derivative of sine is cosine and the derivative of two x is two so the final answer is four sine two x cosine two x one problem that i wanted to give before that was this one the derivative of sine squared of x but now that you know how to do the previous one you can certainly do this one so just like before i would recommend moving the exponent to the outside it makes the whole problem a lot easier so we're going to move it to the front we're going to have 2 and then we're going to keep the inside part the same subtract the exponent by 1 so it's 2 sine raised to the first power and then we're going to take the derivative of the inside function which is cosine now 2 sine x cosine x is also equal to sine 2x it's a double angle formula so you can write your final answer like this if you want or you could leave it like this now what about this problem what is the derivative of sine of tangent x squared go ahead and try that so we're going to begin by differentiating sine the derivative of sine is cosine and whatever is inside of sine that's going to be inside of cosine now let's move on to the next one the derivative of tangent is secant squared and the angle of tangent is x squared so the angle of secant squared will be x squared next let's work our way in the derivative of x squared is 2x and so that is the answer to the problem which we can write as 2x cosine of tangent x squared times secant squared x squared 

Transcript for: Calculus - Chain Rule - Derivatives
if you were given a problem like this on a test what would you do to find the derivative of it how would you find the derivative of the fifth power of sine of cosine raised to the fourth power of the square root of tangent of the natural log of x now because we have functions within or inside of other functions we need to use the chain rule to find the derivative of this expression so before we work on this example let's talk about how to use the chain rule so let's say we have the composite function f of g of x so g is inside of f what you need to do is take the derivative of the outside part that is of f while leaving the inside part g the same and then you're going to multiply that by the derivative of the inside function so times g prime and that's the process by which we could use the chain rule to find the derivative of composite functions now let's work on some examples to help you to see how to apply this information let's say if we want to find the derivative of x squared plus 5x raised to the fourth power if you want to pause the video and try it feel free to do so so the first thing we need to do is we need to use the power rule for instance the derivative of let's say u to the fourth is gonna be four u to the third so using the power rule on this exponent we're gonna have four times everything inside we're not going to change what's on the inside and then subtracting four by one we have three so you can think of u as the variable as the stuff inside of the function now our next step is to multiply by the derivative of what was inside the function in this case u prime so the derivative of x squared is 2x the derivative of 5x is 5. this would be the answer so that's how you could use the chain rule when dealing with composite functions you differentiate the outside part first while leaving the inside part the same and then multiply by the derivative of the inside part let's work on some more examples for the sake of practice now let's try this example go ahead and find the derivative of tangent x squared feel free to take a minute and work on that example so the first thing that we're going to do is find the derivative of the outer function that is of tangent the derivative of tangent is secant squared so what goes inside secant squared well this is going to be the angle of tangent so whatever is inside of here we're going to put it there next we need to find the derivative of the inside part of the function that is of x squared the derivative of x squared is 2x and so we could write the final answer as 2x secant squared x squared so that is the derivative of tangent x squared that's how you could find it here's another example you could try that'll prepare you for the problem ahead go ahead and find the derivative of sine tangent x cubed go ahead and work on that one so let's start with the outer function sine the derivative of sine we know is cosine now everything that is inside of sine we need to rewrite and put it inside of cosine so we need to rewrite tangent x to the third so now we're done with cosine let's move on to the next one tangent the derivative of tangent is secant squared now the angle inside of tangent is x cubed so that's going to be the same angle for secant squared since secant squared came from tangent now the last thing we need to do is find the derivative of x cubed which is 3x squared and that's the process by which we could find the derivative of these multiple composite functions start from the outside and work your way in so this is the answer for this example so based on those three examples you now know everything that you need in order to try this one so go ahead and take a minute and find the derivative of that function the first thing that i recommend doing is to rewrite the expression in a way that'll make this problem a lot easier now one thing i want to mention is that let's say if you have cosine raised to the four of x this can be rewritten as cosine x raised to the fourth power when dealing with a chain rule it's easier to work with problems in this format as opposed to this one so i'm going to adjust it accordingly so cosine to the fourth power let me highlight this in blue this is going to be cosine and then we have tangent now we have the square root of tangent which is the same as tangent raised to the one-half so i'm going to put a one-half outside of the green brackets to represent the square root symbol and then for cosine to the fourth i'm going to put an exponent of four outside of the blue brackets and then we have a 5 for outside of sine so that's how we can rewrite this expression to make the work a lot easier so we're going to do now is we're going to take the 5 move it to the front we're going to find the derivative of the outer part of the function so this was u to the fifth power will be 5 times u to the fourth power so it's going to be 5 and then we're going to keep everything on the inside the same so we have sine cosine tangent of ln x raised to the one half raised to the fourth and then we're going to subtract this by one so this is going to be to the fourth so now that we've dealt with the outer part of the function let's work our way in so now we need to find the derivative of sine the derivative of sine is cosine and the angle of sine is everything that we see here so that's going to be cosine tangent ln x raised to the one-half and we still have the fourth power for cosine so now we're done with sine we need to move on to cosine now the derivative of cosine is going to be times negative sine and the angle for cosine is what we see here so that's going to be tangent lnx raised to the one half now i do need to take a step back before we can find the derivative of cosine we need to work with this exponent first so let's get rid of this so starting with this exponent moving it to the front it's going to be times 4 and then everything that is in the blue brackets so it's going to be cosine tangent ln x raised to the one one-half and then we're going to subtract this by one so that's going to be three so now we could find the derivative of cosine as we work our way in so it's going to be times the derivative of cosine is negative sine and then the angle of cosine is what we see here so that's going to be the angle of sine that's tangent ln x raised to the one-half now the next thing we need to do is move on to tangent but before we do that we need to work with the exponent so it's going to be times one half everything inside so that's tangent ln x and then one half minus one that's a negative half so now that we are through with that exponent we can work our way inside the derivative of tangent is secant squared and then the angle of tangent is ln x next we could find the derivative of ln x which is one over x so that's basically n that's how you could find the derivative of this entire expression using a chain rule so this is the answer now you could simplify it or rewrite it in a more pleasant form but i'm going to leave the answer like this so thanks for watching and don't forget to subscribe to this channel 

Transcript for: Find The Derivative Using The Chain Rule
what is the derivative of this function the square root of x plus the square root of x plus the square root of x again how can we find the derivative of that expression well we need to use the chain rule because we have functions within other functions now just to review here's how you could use the chain rule so let's say you want to find the derivative of a composite function f of g of x what you need to do first is find the derivative of the function on the outside which will be f prime while keeping the inside the same times the derivative of the inside function and so that's the process by which we could find the derivative of a composite function now for this problem the first thing we need to do is rewrite it so what we have is x plus parentheses x plus x to the half x to the half is the square root of x and then this is raised to the half that's this square root symbol here and then everything is raised to the half for the square root that encompasses now everything first thing we're going to use is the power rule on this exponent here so first we're going to move the one half to the front and then we're going to keep the inside part the same so that's x plus x plus x to the half erase it a half and now we need to subtract this by one one-half minus one is negative one-half now the next thing that we need to do is find the derivative of the inside function the derivative of x is going to be one and then the derivative of this expression we need to move the one half to the front so it's going to be one-half times what we see on the inside we're going to keep that part the same and then subtract this by one one-half minus one that's going to be negative a half now we need to find the derivative of the inside function the derivative of x is one and the derivative of x to the half we need to use the power rule again so it's going to be one half x to the minus one half so all of this represents the derivative of the inside function so this is the answer but what we need to do at this point is we need to clean it up a bit so let's go ahead and do that the negative one-half tells us that we have a square root function but underneath the fraction or on the denominator fraction so we can rewrite this whole expression like this so this one remains on top of the fraction the 2 is on the bottom and all of this will be on the bottom due to the negative exponent so that's going to be the square root of x plus the square root of x plus the square root of x so this entire fraction is going to be multiplied by everything we see here so all of this needs to go on the numerator of that fraction but we're going to do this one step at a time so we have one plus now we need a fraction for this the two is going to be on the bottom and then the negative one half tells us that this expression will be on the bottom but with a radical sign so it's going to be the square root of x and then plus x to the half is the square root of x and then this term is multiplied by what we see here so that's times one plus one half x to the negative one half that's one over two square root x and all of this is multiplied to that expression so we can write the final answer like this so on the bottom we have 2 square root x plus the square root of x plus root x on top we're going to have 1 plus and then we can combine those two things into a single fraction so it's going to be 1 plus 1 over 2 square root x divided by 2. square root x plus square root x so this right here is the final answer so that is the derivative of this expression i'm not going to simplify it any further than that so that's it for this video so now you know how to find the derivative of this function using the chain rule 

Transcript for: Simplifying Derivatives
in this lesson we're going to focus on simplifying derivatives so let's start with an example problem what is the derivative of this function x cubed times 2x minus 5 raised to the fourth power now for this problem we need to use the product rule and here's the formula for that so the derivative of f times g is the derivative of the first part f prime times the second plus the first part times the derivative of the second part so we can clearly see that f is x cubed and g is 2x minus 5 raised to the fourth power now f prime the derivative of x cubed that's going to be 3x squared and to find g prime we need to use the chain rule so the derivative of two x minus five raised to the fourth power is gonna be four and then keep the inside the same two x minus five using a power rule subtract this by one and then differentiate the inside function 2x minus 5 which is 2. so now let's apply this so it's going to be f prime which is 3x squared times g which is 2x minus 5 raised to the fourth power plus f that's x cubed and then g prime which is four times two and that's eight so it's going to be times eight two x minus five cubed now what should we do once we get to this part how can we simplify this expression the best thing to do right now is to take out the gcf the greatest common factor and so we can factor out an x squared and we could take out two x minus five at least three of them because there's three here and four here so we gotta take out the lower of the two numbers so if we take out x squared and two x minus 5 to the third power from that expression what's left over so the x squared is gone we took out three of these so there's gonna be one left over with a three in front so it's going to be 3 times 2x minus 5. now for the next one we took out x squared so there's an x left over we have an 8 and we take out all three of 2x minus 5's so it's going to be plus 8 x and that's all that's left over for that term now all we need to do is distribute the three and combine like terms so three times two x that's six x three times negative five that's negative 15 plus 8x and now let's add these two so we're going to have x squared times 2x minus 5 to the third power and 6x plus 8x that's 14x so this is the final answer fully simplified now let's work on another example feel free to pause the video if you want to try it what is the derivative of x squared times the square root of 4 minus 9x so once again we need to use the product rule and so you could rewind it if you need to look at the formula but the gist of it is that you need to differentiate the first part of the function which is x squared so that's 2x and then keep the second part the same so we're going to rewrite the square root of 4 minus 9x plus keep the first part the same and then differentiate the second part now let's focus on that because to differentiate this we need to use the chain rule and before we do that we need to rewrite it as four minus nine x raised to the one half now whenever you're differentiating a composite function let's say if you want to find the derivative of f of g of x based on the chain rule you need to differentiate the outside part of f and then keep the inside part the inside function g of x the same and then multiply by the derivative of the inside function so that's the main idea behind the chain rule so first let's differentiate the outside part of the function by using the power rule so it's going to be one half and then keep the inside function g of x the same so four minus nine x and then subtract the exponent by one so one half minus one or one half minus two over two that's negative one over two and then multiply by g prime of x the derivative of the inside function so the derivative of four minus nine x that's negative nine so that's what we have now so i'm going to combine these two so that's gonna be times negative nine over two and then four minus nine x raised to the negative one half now i'm going to rewrite this expression so let's erase it first and let's write it as a rational exponent so it's four minus nine x to the one half now in this form this is when you want to factor the expression where you want to take out the greatest common factor so we could take out an x from both terms because they both contain an x now in the last example we had 2x minus 5 raised to the fourth power and the first term and in the third power for the second and when you're dealing with four and three you want to take out the lowest of the two numbers so you take out three now in this case we have a negative exponent so what should we factor out one-half or negative one-half well negative one-half is lower than one half on the number line so because it's less we need to factor out four minus nine x to the negative one half now when you take out the gcf if you want to find out what goes on the inside divide what you had by the gcf so if we divide 2x by x the x variables will cancel and we're going to get 2. if we divide these two we need to subtract the exponents for instance let's say if you want to divide x to 7 by x to 4. this is going to be x to the 7 minus 4 which is x cubed so in this case if we wish to divide these two we're going to take one half and subtract it by negative one-half which becomes one-half plus one-half which is a whole so this is going to be four minus nine x raised to the first power which is great now let's focus on the second term negative nine over two x squared divided by x it's going to be negative nine over two times x and then if we divide these two negative one-half minus negative one-half that's gonna be zero so this is completely gone we took it out so this is what we have now so first let's distribute 2. so this is going to be 2 times 4 which is 8 and then 2 times negative 9x that's negative 18x and then minus 9 over 2x now we need to get common denominators so 18x i'm going to multiply by 2 over 2. so it's going to be negative 36 x over two and then minus nine over two x so negative thirty six minus nine is negative forty five so we have eight minus forty 45 over two x and then that's multiplied by x times four minus nine x raised to negative one half what we can do at this point is take this term or that factor and move it to the bottom to make the negative exponent positive so this is going to give us x times 8 minus 45 over 2 x divided by 4 minus 9x to the positive one-half now we can write the final answer as x times this stuff and then let's convert this rational exponent into a radical so that's simply the square root of 4 minus 9x so you can leave your answer like this if you want to but if you're told to rationalize the denominator you can take it one step further so if you need to do that you can multiply the top and the bottom by the square root of four minus nine x so you can also leave your answer as x 8 minus 45 x over 2 times the square root of 4 minus 9x divided by 4 minus 9x so if you need to rationalize it you can report your answer in this form but if it's not necessary to rationalize it this form is also acceptable there's a lot less writing in this form you 

Transcript for: Higher Order Derivatives
in this video we're going to focus on finding higher order derivatives so let's say if we have the function f of x and it's equal to 3x to the fifth power plus 2x cubed minus 6x plus 4. and in this problem go ahead and determine the second derivative of the function well we need to find the first derivative to begin so the derivative of x to the fifth using the power rule is 5x to the fourth and the derivative of x cubed is three x squared and the derivative of x is one and the derivative of a constant is zero so this is going to give us 15 x to the fourth two times three is six and so this is the first derivative now we need to differentiate this expression one more time to get the second derivative so if we differentiate x to the fourth that's going to be 4x cubed and the derivative of x squared is 2x so the second derivative is going to be 15 times 4 which is 60 and 6 times 2 is 12. so it's going to be 60x cubed plus 12x now let's try another problem let's say that h of x is x squared cosine x go ahead and determine the second derivative of this function now for this problem we need to use the product rule the derivative of f times g is going to be the derivative of the first part f prime plus or times the second part plus the first part times the derivative of the second part so we could say that f is x squared and g is cosine so if f is x squared f prime has to be 2x and if g is cosine g prime the derivative of cosine is going to be negative sine so using this formula h prime of x is going to equal the derivative of the first part which is 2x times the second part that's cosine plus the first part which is just f4 x squared times the derivative of the second part which is negative sine x now we could factor the expression or we could leave it like this right now it's best to leave it the way it is so we have 2x cosine x minus x squared sine x now let's go ahead and find the second derivative so we're going to have to use the product rule twice for this term and for that one so for the first term let's separate it into two functions so this is the first part that's f and here's the second part g so h double prime is going to be the derivative of the first part the derivative of two x is two and then times second part which we're going to leave the same cosine plus we're going to keep the first part the same that's f times g prime the derivative of the second part the derivative of cosine is negative sine now let's focus on x squared sine x so let's say this is f and this is going to be g so the derivative of the first part x squared is 2x times the second and then plus the first part x squared times the derivative of the second part which is cosine so now let's rewrite everything so we have 2 cosine x minus 2x sine x and don't forget to distribute this negative sign so minus another 2x sine x minus x squared cosine x so it looks like we can combine like terms so the final answer is going to be 2 cosine x minus 4x sine x minus x squared cosine x so that's h double prime now let's say if f of x is equal to the square root of x and we need to find the third derivative f triple prime of x how can we do so so go ahead and try that problem now first we need to rewrite the expression so the square root of x is the same as x to the one half and let's use the power rule so keep in mind the power rule is n x raised to the n minus one so it's going to be one half x raised to the one half minus one now one half minus one is basically one half minus two over two which is a negative one over two so this is the first derivative now i wouldn't recommend rewriting it and simplifying it yet until you find the third derivative so let's go ahead and find the second derivative while it's in this form so the derivative of x to the negative one-half that's going to be negative one-half x and then negative one-half minus one now one-half times negative one-half that's negative one-fourth and negative one-half minus one think of negative one-half minus two over two negative one minus two is negative three so this is going to be x raised to negative three over two now let's find the third derivative so using the constant multiple rules can be negative 1 4 times the derivative of that expression so that's negative 3 over 2 x raised to the negative three over two minus one now negative one times negative three that's going to be positive three and then four times two is eight now negative three over two minus one or negative three over two minus two over two that's negative five over two so this is the answer all we need to do is simplify or rewrite it so right now the third derivative is equal to 3x to the negative 5 over 2 divided by 8. now to make the negative exponent positive we need to move the variable to the bottom so it's going to be 3 over 8 x raised to the positive 5 over two now we can convert this into its radical form so it's three over eight square root x to the fifth power now we could still simplify this expression further if we want to x to the fifth is x to the fourth times x and the square root of x to the fourth keep in mind the index number is two so it's four over two which is two so it's going to be x squared that's the square root of x to the fourth now we could still rationalize the denominator if you want to so if we multiply the top and the bottom by the square root of x we're going to have 3 square root x over 8 x squared times the square root of x squared which is x and x squared times x is x cubed so you can write your answer as 3 square root x divided by 8 x cubed if you want to fully simplify it and rationalize the denominator at the same time now let's work on one more problem let's say if you're given the second derivative and it's 5 over x squared go ahead and determine the fourth derivative of the function now first we need to rewrite the expression so i'm going to move this to the top so this is the same as five x to the negative two so we already have the second derivative let's find a third so we need to find the derivative of five x to the negative two so it's going to be five times the derivative of x to the negative two which is negative two x to the negative two minus one which is negative three and so five times negative two that's negative ten so the third derivative is negative ten x to the negative third so now we need to find the fourth derivative so it's going to be negative 10 times the derivative of x to the negative third which is negative 3 x to the negative 3 minus 1 which is negative 4. and negative ten times negative three is thirty so we have thirty x to the negative four which we can rewrite as thirty divided by x to the fourth power and so if you're given the second derivative you need to differentiate it two more times to get to the fourth derivative and so that's just the basis of higher order derivative problems you just gotta find the second third or fourth derivative you 

Transcript for: Implicit Differentiation
in this video we're going to focus on problems associated with implicit differentiation so given the equation x squared plus y squared is equal to 100 find dydx now i want to go over a few things let's say if you differentiate x cubed with respect to x you know the answer is 3x squared but what about if you differentiate y cube with respect to x it's going to be three y squared times d y d x and for instance if you differentiate let's say r to the fourth power with respect to x it's gonna be four cubed times dr dx for this example dx over dx will cancel so there's no point in writing it so keep that in mind so when doing implicit differentiation we're going to differentiate this function with respect to x so every time you differentiate a y variable you need to add the term dydx to it so let's go ahead and differentiate both sides with respect to x the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of y squared with respect to x is 2y times dydx and the derivative of a constant is zero so now let's isolate d y d x so let's take the two x and move it to the other side so if we subtract both sides by two x on the left we'll have two y 2y dydx and on the right negative 2x now let's divide both sides by 2y we could also cancel negative 2. so d y over d x is equal to negative x over y so now that we have d y d x we can move on to the second part of the problem calculate the slope at the point six comma eight so let's evaluate d y d x at that point so x is six and y is eight so we need to reduce this fraction six is three times two and eight is four times two so we could cancel a two and so d y d x is equal to negative three over four at the point six comma eight and that's the answer now let's move on to number two given the equation x cubed plus 4xy plus y squared is equal to 13 find dydx so let's differentiate everything with respect to x so the derivative of x cubed that's going to be three x squared now what about the derivative of four x y because we need to use the product rule so let's treat for x as if it's f and y as if it's g so here's the form of the product rule the derivative of f times g is going to be the derivative of the first part f prime times the second plus the first part times the derivative of the second part so the derivative of four x is four and we're going to leave the second part the way it is that's g and then plus f the first part times g prime the derivative of the second part the derivative of y is one but with respect to x is going to be one times d y d x and the derivative of y squared is going to be two y d y d x and the derivative of the constant 13 is zero now we need to isolate d y d x so what i'm going to do is out of these two terms i'm going to take out d y d x i'm going to have 4x plus 2y now every term that doesn't have a dydx i'm going to move it to the other side of the equation so i'm going to move 3x squared plus 4y to the right side they're positive on the left side but they're going to be negative on the right side so i have negative 3x squared minus 4y now i need to divide both sides by 4x plus 2y and so now i have the answer to the first part of the problem so dydx is equal to negative 3x squared minus 4y divided by 4x plus 2y now there's nothing else that we can do here to simplify this expression so all we can do is evaluate it at the point one comma two so x is one y is two so one squared is one times negative three four times two is eight and then two times two is four so negative three minus eight is negative eleven four plus four is eight so dydx is equal to negative 11 divided by 8 at the point 1 comma 2. number 3 find dydx by implicit differentiation so let's differentiate both sides with respect to x on five minus x squared is equal to sine and then x y squared so the derivative of five is 0 and the derivative of negative x squared that's negative 2x the derivative of sine is cosine now according to chain rule we need to keep the inside function the same and then we need to multiply by the derivative of the inside so that is the derivative of x y squared so we need to use the product rule so the derivative of the first part x is one times the second y squared plus the first part x times the derivative of the second part the derivative of y squared is two y times d y d x so we need to isolate d y d x well the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to divide both sides by cosine x y squared actually you know what i'm not going to do that i'm going to distribute it i'm going to distribute cosine to what i have here so negative 2x is equal to y squared cosine xy squared and then plus 2 x y cosine x y squared times d y d x so i'm going to take this term move it to that side so i have negative 2x minus this term and that's equal to 2xy cosine times dydx now the last thing i need to do is divide both sides by 2xy cosine so the final answer is negative 2x minus y squared cosine xy squared divided by 2xy cosine and so that's how you can use implicit differentiation with trigonometric functions now let's try it one more problem let's say if we have x cubed plus y cube is equal to let's say nine find d squared y over dx squared and evaluate it at the point one comma two go ahead and try that so first we need to find the first derivative so let's differentiate both sides with respect to x so the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared the derivative of y cubed is three y squared times d y d x and the derivative of a constant is zero now let's subtract both sides by three x squared so on the right side it's negative three x squared and then let's divide both sides by three y squared so d y d x is going to be negative three divided by three is negative one so d y d x is negative x squared over y squared so we have the first derivative at this point we need to find a second derivative so what we need to do is differentiate this function so the derivative of d y d x with respect to x is going to be d squared y over dx squared and then we need to use the quotient rule for negative x squared over y squared so the derivative of f over g is going to be g f prime minus f of g prime over g squared so in this example f is negative x squared g is y squared so f prime is going to be negative 2x and g prime is 2y dydx so let's use this formula so let's start with g which is y squared times f prime so that's negative two x minus f which is negative x squared times g prime so that's two y d y over d x all divided by g squared which is y squared squared now keep in mind d y d x is negative x squared over y squared so we can replace that with negative x squared over y squared so the second derivative is going to be we can write this as negative two x y squared and then these two negative signs will become positive so we have plus 2 x squared y and then we're going to replace d y d x with negative x squared over y squared and then y squared squared is y to the fourth at this point we could cancel a y so we have negative two x y squared and then two x squared times negative x squared that's going to be minus two x to the fourth power and we still have a y left over on the bottom all divided by y to the fourth now to eliminate the complex fraction let's multiply the top and the bottom by y so we're gonna have negative two x y to the third minus two x to the fourth power over y to the fifth power now if we want to we can take out a negative two x so the second derivative is going to be negative 2x and then we're going to have y cubed and then if we take out negative 2x from this term negative 2x to the fourth divided by negative two x the negative twos will cancel four minus one is three so that's going to give us x cubed all divided by y to the fifth power now we have the point one comma two so now that we have the second derivative in its simplified form we can evaluate it at one two so let's replace x with one and y with two so we have negative two times one and then two to the third is eight one cube is one two to the fifth power that's two times two which is four times two that's eight times two sixteen times two is thirty two eight plus one is nine and thirty two is sixteen times two so we could cancel a two and so the final answer is negative nine over sixteen so that's the value of the second derivative at the point one comma two you 

Transcript for: Derivatives of Inverse Trigonometric Functions
in this lesson we're going to focus on differentiating inverse trigonometric functions so let's get right into it what is the derivative of arc sine of x cubed go ahead and try this problem now you need to know the formula if you know the formula life is easy the derivative of some generic arc sine function let's say arc sine u is equal to u prime divided by the square root of 1 minus u squared so all you need to do is identify u and u prime well the first part is straightforward because u is the stuff inside of the arc sine function so we can see that u is equal to x cubed now u prime the derivative of u that's going to be the derivative of x cubed which is 3x squared so now we can get the answer so the derivative of arc sine x cubed is going to be u prime which is 3x squared divided by the square root of 1 minus u squared or 1 minus x cubed squared so the final answer is 3x squared divided by the square root of 1 minus x to the sixth power and so this is the answer now let's try another example what is the derivative of arc cosine 5x minus 9. go ahead and try that so here's the formula that you need the derivative of arc cosine of u is very similar to the arc sine of u formula it's going to be negative u prime instead of positive u prime divided by the square root of 1 minus u squared so in this example u is five x minus nine that's the stuff inside of the r cosine function and the derivative of five x minus nine is simply five so the answer is gonna be negative five divided by the square root of 1 minus 5x minus 9 squared and that's the solution for this problem here's another problem that you could work with what is the derivative of arc tangent square root x so if you don't have the formula check out your textbook it should be in it but here it is for arc tangent the derivative of arc tan or inverse tan of u is going to be u prime divided by one plus u squared so we can see that u is the square root of x which if we rewrite it that's x to the one half now u prime that's i brought you to the half for some reason u prime is the derivative of x to the one half so using the power rule it's going to be one half x to the minus one half and we can rewrite that as one over two x to the positive one half and then converting it back to radical form it's one over two square root x so now let's use the formula it's u prime which is square root x divided by 1 plus well actually i take that back u prime is this thing right here so that's 1 over 2 square root x and then divided by 1 plus u squared so u is the square root of x and once we square it it simply becomes x so this is 1 over 2 square root x divided by 1 plus x now we could simplify the expression now let's multiply the top and the bottom by 2 square root x so we can get rid of the fraction in the numerator so this is going to be one over one plus x times two square root x and if you need to rationalize the expression you can multiply the top and bottom by the square root of x so on the denominator the square root of x times the square root of x simply is x so you can leave your final answer like that so it's the square root of x divided by two x times one plus x and so that's the inverse tangent or the derivative of arctangent of square root x let's consider one more example find the derivative of arc secant x to the fourth power so let's begin with the formula so the derivative of arc secant is going to be u prime divided by the absolute value of u times the square root of u squared minus one so we can see that u is x to the fourth and u prime is four x cubed so this is going to be u prime which is 4 x cubed divided by the absolute value of u which is x to the fourth now because this term will always be positive we really don't need the absolute value around it and then it's going to be the square root of u squared so x to the 4 squared is really x to the 8 and then minus 1. now we could simplify this expression we could cancel three of the four x variables leaving one in a denominator so this is going to be four and this time i'm going to put back the absolute value symbol so four over x times the square root of x to the eight minus one and so that's the derivative of arc secant x to the fourth power you 

Transcript for: Derivatives of Exponential Functions
in this video we're going to focus on finding the derivative of exponential functions so let's start with some examples that contain the base e what is let's do that again what is the derivative of e to the x here's the formula that you need to know the derivative of e to the u where u is some function is going to be the same thing e to the u but times the derivative of u so the derivative of e to the x is going to be e to the x times the derivative of x which is one so it's simply e three x so based on that example go ahead and find the derivative of these expressions e to the 5x plus 3 and e to the x squared go ahead and try these two examples so first we need to rewrite the expression that we have e to the five x plus three and then times the derivative of five x plus three which is five so the answer is five times e raised to the 5x plus 3. now for the next example it's going to be the same thing e raised to the x squared times the derivative of x squared which is 2x so the answer is going to be 2x e raised to the x squared let's work on a similar problem so let's find the derivative of e raised to the x cubed plus 8x so it's going to be the same thing e raised to the x cubed plus 8x times the derivative of the exponent the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of 8x is 8. and so that's the answer it's 3x squared plus 8 times e raised to the x cubed plus 8x now sometimes the base may not be e it might be something else so for instance what is the derivative of 3 raised to the x the derivative of a raised to u is going to be the same thing a to u times u prime times ln a now if we compare that to e to the u which was e to the u times u prime now it's supposed to be l and e but the natural log of e is one so that part is not needed so you need to use this formula for everything else other than e so a to u is the same thing the derivative of x is one and then times ln a or ln3 and so that is the answer try these three examples now using that formula it's going to be a to the u which is the same thing so a is 7 u is 2x minus 5 and then times u prime which is the derivative of two x minus five that's two times ln a or ln seven and so that's it for that example and then in this problem a is nine u is x cubed so it's a to the u times u prime the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and then times lna or ln9 and for the last one it's going to be a to u times the derivative of 2x minus x squared which is 2 minus 2x times the natural log of 5. so hopefully these examples gave you a good idea of how to differentiate exponential functions now let's work on a mixed review of problems go ahead and find the derivative of e raised to the sine x and differentiate 4 raised to the tangent x so it's going to be e to the u where u is sine x times u prime the derivative of sine is cosine so that's it for the first problem for the second it's going to be a to u where a is 4 u is tangent times u prime the derivative of tangent is secant squared times the natural log of a and a is 4. let's work on some harder problems that involve more steps so what is the derivative of x cubed e to the 4x now for this problem we need to use the product rule and the derivative of f times g is f prime g plus f g prime so f is the first part of the function that's x cubed and g is the second part e to the 4x so f prime the derivative of x cubed that's going to be 3x squared times g which is just e to the 4x plus f that's x cubed times g prime the derivative of e to the 4x is e to the 4x times the derivative of 4x which is 4. and so that's going to be the answer but it looks like we could simplify it we could factor out the gcf so we can take out e to the 4x and an x squared so it's going to be x squared e to the 4x and then we're going to have a 3 left over and over here we're going to have 4x let's try this problem find the derivative of e to the x plus e to the negative x divided by e to the x minus e to the negative x go ahead and try that so since we have a fraction we need to use the quotient rule and here's the formula the derivative of f over g is going to be g f prime minus f of g prime over g squared so we can see that f is the numerator so that's e to the x plus e to the negative x and g is the stuff in the denominator so that's e to the x minus e to the negative x so f prime is going to be the derivative of e to the x is just e to the x times the derivative of x which is one so the derivative of e to the x will be the same now for e to the negative x it's going to be e to the negative x times the derivative of negative x which is negative one now for g prime it's going to be e to the x minus e to the negative x times negative 1. now let's go ahead and apply this formula so g is going to be e to the x minus e to the negative x and then times f prime which is e to the x minus e to the negative x due to this negative sign and then minus f which is e to the x plus e to the negative x and then times g prime which is e to the x these two negative signs will cancel so that's going to be plus e to the negative x and then all of that is going to be divided by g squared which g is e to the x minus e to negative x so how can we simplify this expression so notice that these two expressions are the same so we can write them as e to the x minus e to the negative x squared and these two are the same so that's going to be e to the x plus e to the negative x squared and then it's divided by this thing here now what do you think we need to do at this point should we stop here or should we continue is there a way that we could simplify this expression do we have to foil it turns out that we could factor this expression notice that this is in the form of a squared minus b squared so a is e to the x minus e to the negative x and b is e to the x plus e to the negative x now first let me get rid of this stuff a squared minus b squared is a minus b times a plus b using the difference of squares method so this expression is going to be a which is e to the x minus e to negative x so this is a in red and b is highlighted in blue so a minus b so minus i'm going to distribute the negative sign to both those terms so it's going to be minus e to the x minus e to the negative x so that's a negative b and then it's going to be a plus b so a is still the same and then plus this time it's going to be positive so plus b e to the x plus e to the negative x and this is all divided by e to the x minus e to the negative x squared now notice that e to the x and negative e to the x they add up to zero so they cancel and negative e to the negative x and positive e to the negative x cancels as well so on the left side we have negative one plus negative one which is going to be negative two e to the negative x and then on the right side one plus one is two so that's going to be two e to the positive x negative two times two that's equal to negative four and what's e to the negative x times e to the x when you multiply by a common base you need to add the exponents so x squared times x cubed is 5. e to the negative x times e to the x that's gonna be e to the negative x plus x negative x plus x is zero and e to the zero is one so it's negative four times one which is simply negative four and then this is still divided by e c x minus e to the negative x squared and so that's the answer for this problem that's it for this video thanks for watching though you 

Transcript for: Derivative of Logarithmic Functions
in this video we're going to focus on finding the derivative of a logarithmic function but let's start with natural log functions first so what is the derivative of ln x now there's a formula that you need to know the derivative of ln u is equal to u prime divided by u so in this example u is x and the derivative of x is one so therefore the derivative of natural log of x that's going to be one over x let's try another problem what is the derivative of ln x squared what do you think the answer is in this example u is x squared and derivative of u or u prime that's going to be 2x so we could simplify this x squared is basically x times x so we could cancel an x and so the final answer is 2 over x now what you could do also is you can move the 2 to the front before you find the derivative of the function so ln x squared is the same as 2 l and x and we know that the derivative of l and x is 1 over x so this is going to be 2 times 1 over x which will give us the same answer of 2x i meant to say 2 divided by x and not 2x go ahead and try this one find the derivative of ln x cubed so let's rewrite the expression first so this is 3 ln x so that's going to be 3 times the derivative of l and x and the derivative of l and x is one over x so this is just going to be three divided by x here's another example find the derivative of the natural log of x plus five so let's use the formula u is x plus five u prime the derivative of x plus five is one so the answer is going to be u prime over u or 1 divided by x plus 5. let's work on some more examples differentiate the natural log of x squared plus 4. so in this example u is x squared plus 4 and the derivative of x squared plus 4 is 2x so using the formula u prime divided by u it's going to be 2x divided by x squared plus 4. so it's basically the derivative of the function on the inside divided by the original function go ahead and try this problem differentiate the natural log of seven x plus five minus x cubed now let's differentiate the inside function the derivative of seven x is seven the derivative of a constant is zero and the derivative of negative x cubed is negative three x squared divided by the original stuff on the inside which is seven x plus five minus x cubed so that's going to be the answer for this example now let's try some harder problems go ahead and find the derivative of the natural log of sine x so in this example u is equal to sine x u prime the derivative of sine that's going to be cosine so it's going to be u prime over u so cosine divided by sine and what trig function represents cosine divided by sine cosine over sine is cotangent so the natural log of sine x is equivalent to cotangent x that is the derivative of the natural log of sine x now go ahead and differentiate the natural log of the seventh root of x try that problem now the best thing to do for this example is to rewrite it so let's rewrite the radical as a rational exponent so this is going to be x raised to the 1 over 7. and then we could take the exponent move it to the front so this is 1 over 7 times the derivative of the natural log of x so this is going to be one over seven times one over x so the final answer is one over seven x here's another problem that you can work on go ahead and find the derivative of the cube root of ln x once again i suggest rewriting the expression into a form that's easier to deal with so the cube root of ln x that's basically ln x raised to the one third now this time the one third applies not only to the x but the entire ln x expression so you can't just move it to the front what we need to do is apply the chain rule and let's say if you want to differentiate a composite function f of g of x you need to differentiate the outside part of the function keeping the inside the same and then multiply by the derivative of the inside so that's the basic idea behind the chain rule so to use that let's use the power rule so let's focus on the outside part of the function let's keep the natural log the inside part g of x the same so using the power rule this will go to the front so it's going to be 1 3 and then we need to subtract the exponent by 1 times the derivative of the inside which is g prime the derivative of l and x is one over x now one third minus one that's the same as one over three minus three over three and that's negative two over three so we have one third ln x to the negative two thirds times one over x now there's going to be a one in the numerator we have a 3 and an x in the bottom so i'm going to write that as 3x now l and x will have a negative exponent if it's placed in the numerator but if we place it in the denominator it's going to have a positive exponent and so we can rewrite the final answer as 1 over 3x times the cube root of ln x squared and so that's it now let's go over the derivative of regular logarithmic functions so what is the derivative of log base 3 of x now here's the formula the derivative of log base a of u is equal to u prime divided by u times ln a in the case of the natural log which has the base e this is going to be u prime over u l and e but l and e is one so it simply becomes u prime over u but if you have a base that's not e then you need to have l and a other than that everything else is the same so in this example u is equal to x so the derivative of x is one and a is the base that's three so the answer is going to be u prime divided by u which is x times ln a or ln three so it's 1 over x ln 3. here's another example that you can work on differentiate log base 4 of x squared now we can move the 2 in the front if we want to so this is going to be 2 times log base 4 of x so it's going to be u prime that's the derivative of x divided by u which is x times ln a and there's a 2 in front so times 2. so the final answer is going to be 2 x natural log of 4. try this one log base 7 of 5 minus 2x so u is 5 minus 2x u prime that's going to be negative 2 and a is 7. so the formula it's u prime over u lna so u prime is negative 2 and then u is 5 minus 2x times the natural log of the base so the natural log of seven and that's it for that example now what is the derivative of log base two three x minus x to the fourth so go ahead and try that so u is going to be 3x minus x to the fourth power u prime the derivative of 3x is 3 and the derivative of x to the fourth is four x cubed and a is the base that's two so using the formula u prime divided by u times ln a or ln2 so all you need to do is identify u u prime and a and you'll get the answer let's work on one more example with logs so go ahead and find the derivative of log base 5 of tangent x so u is tangent u prime the derivative of tangent is secant squared and a is five so using the formula u prime over u lna it's going to be secant squared divided by tangent x times the natural log of five and that's it now going back to natural logs there's one more example i want to cover what is the derivative of the natural log of ln x so we have a natural log inside a natural log how can we differentiate this function so let's focus on the main one keep in mind the derivative of ln u is u prime over u so notice that u in this example is ln x so if u is l and x what's u prime now you know that the derivative of l and x is one of x so the answer is going to be u prime which is one over x times u which is l and x so let's multiply the top and bottom by x one over x times x is one so it's one over x ln x and that's the answer you

how can we differentiate a function that looks like this a variable raised to a variable what is the derivative of x raised to the x how can we find the answer well first we need to use a process called logarithmic differentiation let's set y equal to x to the x so we need to find d y d x now before you take the derivative of both sides of the equation you need to take the natural log of both sides so you can take this exponent and move it to the front so we're going to have the natural log of y is equal to the natural log of x raised to the x now in this form we can take this variable and move it to the front so ln y is equal to x ln x at this point we could take the derivative of both sides with respect to x now what is the derivative of the natural log of y the derivative of l and y is one over y and times d y d x now on the right side we need to use the product rule the derivative of f times g is going to be the derivative of the first part f prime times the second plus the first part f times the derivative of the second g prime so in this case f is basically x and g is ln x so the derivative of the first part x is one times the second plus the first part times the derivative of the second part and the derivative of l and x is one over x now let's simplify what we have on the right side so we have the natural log of x and then x times one over x is basically one so now what we need to do is we need to multiply both sides by y y times one over y is one and so on the left side we're going to have d y d x on the right side it's going to be y times the natural log of x plus 1. now if you recall we set y equal to x raised to the x so therefore we need to replace y with that expression so the final answer d y d x it's equal to x raised to the x times the natural log of x plus one so that's how you can use logarithmic differentiation to find the derivative of a variable raised to another variable and this is the answer so now you see how to differentiate x to the x now it's your turn go ahead and find the derivative of x raised to the sine x try that problem so what's the first thing that we need to do the first step is to set y equal to x sine x next we need to take the natural log of both sides so ln y is equal to ln x sine x once we do that we can take the sign move it from the exponent position and put it in front of l and x and so we have ln y is equal to sine x times ln x now at this point we can differentiate both sides of the equation so let's write d over dx on both sides and we know that the derivative of the natural log of y is one over y times d y d x and on the right side we need to use the product rule so we need to find the derivative of the first part sine x so the derivative of sine is cosine x times the second part which we're not going to change lnx plus the first part unchange times the derivative of the second the derivative of l and x is one over x so this really not much we can do in terms of simplification so at this point we should multiply both sides by y so we have that d y d x is equal to y times cosine x ln x plus sine x divided by x now the last thing we could do is replace y with what it's equal to keep in mind y is x raised to the sine x it's the original problem so now we can write the final answer d y d x is x raised to the sine x times cosine ln lnx plus sine x over x so as you can see as long as you follow the steps logarithmic differentiation is not that bad you can learn this here's another problem that you could try find the derivative of ln x raised to the x so what's the first thing we need to do what's the first step if you recall the first step is to set this equal to y so y is equal to ln x raised to the x now what is the next thing that we need to do the second step is to take the natural log of both sides so ln y is equal to ln of ln x raised to the x and the third step is to take the exponent and move it to the front so we have ln y is equal to x times ln of ln x now at this point we can take the first derivative of both sides so the derivative of l and y is going to be 1 over y times d y over dx once again we have to use the product rule so this is f and this part is going to be g so f prime is 1 times g so ln of ln x plus f which is x times g prime now what is the derivative of ln ln x let's focus on that how can we differentiate this expression well first you need to know that the derivative of a natural log function l and u is equal to u prime divided by u and so u we can clearly see that u represents ln x so if u is equal to let me write this here ln x what's u prime well we know that the derivative of ln x is one over x so the derivative of ln l and x using the u prime over u formula it's going to be one over x divided by u which is l and x now to simplify that expression we need to multiply the top and the bottom by x one over x times x is one and so it's one over x ln x so this represents g prime which we can write it here at this point now let's simplify the expression that we now have so we have one over y times d y over dx and that's equal to the natural log of ln x and in this expression we could cancel x x divided by x is one so this is gonna be plus one divided by ln x now we can multiply both sides by y and so y times one of y will cancel and so we're gonna have d y over d x and that's equal to y times ln of ln x plus 1 over ln x now the last thing we need to do is replace a y with what it's equal to the original problem ln x raised to the x so this is going to be the final answer this is it let's try one final problem go ahead and find the first derivative of x raised to the one over x so to begin we need to set y equal to x raised to the one over x and then we need to take the natural log of both sides so we can move this to the front so we have ln y is equal to 1 over x times ln x and now we could find the first derivative of both sides so on the left side it's going to be the same 1 over y times dydx on the right side we have a product rule situation so what is the derivative of 1 over x let's focus on that first now we have a rational function so we need to rewrite it and we can rewrite it as x to the negative one and now we can use the power rule so it's negative one x to the minus two and we can rewrite that as negative 1 over x squared by the way so that's the derivative of the first part and then times the second plus the first part times the derivative of the second part the derivative of ln x is one over x now let's simplify on the right side we have negative one over x squared times ln x one times one is one x times x is x squared so we can factor out one over x squared if we do so we're going to have negative 1 over x squared and then this is going to be ln x minus 1. or let's say if we take out positive one over x squared this would be negative ln x plus one and then we could just reverse the order of negative ln x plus one we can write it as one minus ln x it might be better to just leave it like that now let's multiply both sides by y so d y d x is equal to y times one over x squared one minus l and x and recall that y is the original problem x raised to the one over x so the final answer is going to be x to the 1 over x times 1 over x squared times 1 minus ln x so you can leave it like this but we do have a common base x so we could simplify this expression what is x raised to the one over x divided by x squared because if we multiply these two and this will go on the top x squared will remain on the bottom well let's say if we have x to the seven divided by x to the third you know it's x to the fourth it's x raised to seven minus three so this one is going to be x raised to the one over x minus two so you could write the final answer like this x to the one over x minus two times one minus ln x so you could leave it like this or you could leave it in this form both answers are acceptable you

what is the derivative of x rais to the X what is the answer to that question in order to find the answer we need to use a process called logarithmic differentiation now in the past I've created other videos explaining how to do that but in this particular video instead of going through the process I'm just going to give you a formula that'll help you go straight to the answer by the way if you want to see those older videos that explains the process to get the answer feel free to check out the links in the description section below it's going to include these examples that you see here today so let's begin here's the formula you need to use the derivative of U raised to the V is equal to U raised to V * v u Prime over u+ V Prime Ln U so in this example both u and v are equal to X so U Prime and V Prime they're both one in this case so U raised to V is going to be the same thing that we have here x raised to the x X and then v v is x * U Prime which is 1 / U which is X Plus V Prime V Prime is 1 * Ln U where U is X so X overx is just 1 so the answer is X raised to the x * 1 + Ln X Again the video in the description has this example it shows you how to go from point A to point B but this formula will take you straight there now let's move on to the next example let's say we want to find the derivative of x raised to the sinx feel free to pause the video if you want to try this example I'm just going to rewrite the formula real quick so the derivative of U raised to the V is U to the V time v u Prime / U plus v Prime Ln U so first we need to determine u and v u is x v is sin x U Prime the derivative of x is 1 V Prime the derivative of sin x is cine X so now we just got to put it into the formula so U raised to the V it's X raised to the sin x which is always what we start with times v u Prime so V is sin x u Prime is 1 over u u is S Plus V Prime which is cosine time Ln u u is X so Ln U is Ln X so this is the answer it's X ra to sinx * sin XX + cosine x * l x that's all we could do for that feel free to try this problem go ahead and find the derivative of Ln X raised to the X so in this case U is going to be Ln x v is X U Prime the derivative of Ln X is 1 /x V Prime is going to be 1 so U rais to the V it's going to be Ln X rais to X the original problem and then v u Prime so V is X U Prime is 1 /x / u u is Ln X and then plus v Prime which is 1 * Ln u u being Ln X so it's Ln Ln X now we could simplify this 1 /x * X these will cancel to one so this is going to be Ln X ra to x * 1/ Ln x + Ln Ln X so that's going to be the answer for this problem try this one the derivative of x raised to the Ln X so it's basically in Reverse U this time is x v V is Ln X so U Prime is going to be 1 V Prime is 1 /x so it's going to be the original problem X raised to the Ln X and then v u Prime so V is Ln X U Prime is 1 over u u is X Plus V Prime so V Prime is 1 /x and then Ln U where U is X so that's just Ln X so we get a completely different answer now here this is lnx overx and this is Ln X overx we can add them and get two Ln X overx so we can simplify our answer like this x rais to the Ln x * 2 Ln X overx so that's going to be the final answer now let's try this one the derivative of x raised to the E to X by the way for those of you who want a formula sheet with a list of derivatives that you may need to know if you're upcoming tests feel free to check out the links in the description section below I have a formula sheet where you can access these derivative formulas now for this one U let's define U as X and v as the exponent e to the X so U Prime is going to be 1 the derivative of e to X is just e to the X so that's V Prime so it's U to the V so that's the original problem and then v u Prime so V is e to the X U Prime is 1 over U which is X Plus V Prime which is e to x * Ln U so that's Ln X so now let's see if we can simplify this in both cases we have an e to the X so we could factor out the GCF so it's x e to the X if we take out e x we're left with 1 /x plus Ln X and I'm going to put that HDX in the front here on the right side so that's the answer for this particular problem let's do one more go ahead and find the derivative of sin x raised to the X so we're going to make U equal to S V is going to be X U Prime is going to be cosine V Prime is going to be 1 so it's U to the V the original problem sin x rais to X time v u Prime so V is X U Prime is cine X over u u being sin x plus v Prime which is 1 * Ln u u is s now cosine over s we can make that into cotangent so we can write the final answer as sin x rais x * X Cent X plus the natural log of sinx so that's it for uh that particular problem so now you know how to perform logarith aric differentiation you know how to get the answer using this particular formula

what is the derivative of x raised to the natural log of x how do we find the derivative of a variable raised to another variable in this video we're going to talk about how to do just that so we're going to need to use logarithms specifically a process called logarithmic differentiation so the first thing we're going to do is set this expression equal to y and our goal is to find the derivative of y or d y d x because that's going to equal the derivative of that expression but before we take the derivative of both sides of this equation we need to take the natural log of both sides first the reason why we want to do that is because there is a special property of logarithms that we can employ here for instance the natural log of a to the second power is equal to we can move the two to the front and so it's equal to two lna so therefore we could take this natural log and move it to the front and so we're going to have the natural log of y is equal to ln x times ln x or we can write that as ln y is equal to ln x squared now at this point we want to take the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to x so let's write d y d x i mean d over d x on both sides of this equation now what is the derivative of l n y to differentiate a natural log expression let's say we have a generic variable u it's going to be the derivative of u divided by u so if we want to find the derivative of let's say ln x we take the derivative of x which is 1 divided by whatever was here which is x the derivative of ln y is a little bit different the derivative of y is 1 divided by what we see here but because we're differentiating y with respect to x we're going to get d y d x as well differentiating x with respect to x if we were to write d x over d x that would make no sense it would just cancel so we can just leave it as one over x so now let's go back to the problem so the derivative of ln y we said it's 1 over y times the d y over dx now what about the derivative of ln x squared because it's different than just l and x we need to use the chain rule whenever you have a composite function you could use this process to find the derivative so first you want to take the derivative of the outside part of the function that's f while keeping the inside the same and then you want to multiply that by the derivative of the inside function you can think of the outside function as being u squared or x squared so we need to deal with this exponent first so using the power rule we're going to move the 2 to the front imagine if you're taking the derivative of x squared it will be 2x to the first power so it's going to be 2 times the stuff on the inside raised to the first power but keeping the inside function the same we're just going to leave it as ln x and then times g prime or the derivative of the inside function which is going to be 1 over x so that is the derivative of ln x squared so right now we can organize what we have so this is equal to 2 ln x divided by x our next step is to multiply both sides by y we want to get d y d x by itself on one side of the equation so those two variables will cancel and we're going to have d y d x is equal to what we see here but now we're not done remember our original expression is equal to y so we need to replace y with our original expression so we have 2 ln x over x times x raised to the ln x so this is the answer now sometimes it's good to see if we could simplify our answer and there is something that we can do let's move this x to the bottom of that expression so this is x ln x over x or over x to the first power when you divide by a common base you can subtract the exponents for instance x to the seventh divided by x to the third is x to the seven minus three so therefore we could say that d y d x is equal to 2 ln x times well let's put that in parenthesis x raised to the ln x minus one so you just subtract those two exponents so that's another way in which we can represent the final answer so that's how you could find the derivative of x raised to the natural log of x for the sake of practice let's try another example go ahead and find the derivative of x raised to the e to the x take a minute and work on that so let's set it equal to y first so we have y is equal to x raised to the e to the x so now what we're going to do is we're going to take the natural log of both sides so ln y is equal to ln x e to the x and then we're going to move the exponent to the front so we have lny is equal to e raised to the x times ln x so now at this point we need to take the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to x so we're going to add d over dx to both sides now we know that the derivative of ln y is one over y times d y d x but what about the derivative of e to the x l and x well we have the product of two factors so we need to use the product rule the derivative of f times g is going to be f prime the derivative of the first part times the second plus the first part times the derivative of the second so the derivative of e to the x is simply e to the x times the second part which is just ln x plus the first part e to the x times the derivative of the second part the derivative of l and x we know it's one over x so that's what we have right now now notice that we have a common factor e to the x so that tells us to factor out the gcf so we're going to have 1 over y d y over dx and that's equal to e raised to the x times ln x plus 1 over x now at this point we want to multiply both sides by y so we're going to have d y over dx now let's replace y with what we have here so i'm going to write it in front x raised to the e to the x so that was y whoops let's do that again ln x plus 1 over x and then times this e to the x so this is it this is the answer that is the derivative of x raised to the e to the x here's another example problem what about the derivative of sine x raised to the x try that so once again we're going to set that expression equal to y and then just like before we're going to take the natural log of both sides of the equation so this will allow us to take the exponent and move it to the front so we're going to have ln y is equal to x times ln sine x so now at this point we could take the derivative of both sides of the equation the derivative of ln y is going to be as always 1 over y times d y over dx here we need to use the product rule we have our first factor x and the second one ln sine x the derivative of the first part x is just one times the second part ln sine x and then plus the first part x times the derivative of ln sine x now we said that the derivative of the natural log of u it's going to be u prime over u well we can see that u is sine x so u prime is cosine x the derivative of sine so u prime over u becomes cosine divided by sine which is equal to cotangent so that is the derivative of the natural log of sine x it's simply cotangent x now our next step is to multiply both sides by y so we're going to get d y over dx is equal to y times the natural log of sine x plus x cotangent x and then we need to replace y with our original expression so the final answer is going to be d y d x is equal to sine x raised to the x times the natural log of sine x plus x cotangent x and that is the final answer so now you know how to use logarithmic differentiation to find the derivative of functions that contain a variable raised to another variable 

Transcript for: Derivatives of Inverse Functions | Calculus
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the derivative of an inverse function so let's say if we have the function f of x and it's equal to x cubed plus 3 we want to evaluate the derivative of the inverse function when x is 11. so how can we find the value of that expression now here's the formula that you need to know and this is the version that i like to use the derivative of the inverse function is 1 over the derivative of the function at x equals at x sub 1. now you might be wondering what is x sub 1 and what is x sub 2 and clearly they must be different so first let's talk about inverse relations let's say if we have the point 3 comma 7 and this corresponds to the original function f of x to find the coordinates for the inverse function it's going to be seven comma three and so x and y they're switched so i like to call this point x one y one which corresponds to the original function and the point that corresponds to the inverse function just to keep track of everything i like to call it x two y two now notice that these two points are the same and also these two points are the same so therefore x1 is equal to y2 and y1 is equal to x2 because they were switched and it's important to know that f of x1 is equal to y1 and the inverse of x2 is y2 now we need to determine what this number represents is that x1 x2 y1 or y2 so that number inside of the inverse function is x2 so keep that in mind so to keep track of everything i'm going to write x1 comma y1 and x2 y2 so we know that x2 is 11 which means that x i mean y1 is also 11. so we need to determine x1 and y2 now keep in mind y1 is f of x1 so this is f of x1 and this is x1 to the third so x1 and y1 corresponds to the original function f of x so we can say that y1 is equal to x sub 1 raised to the third power plus 3. and we know that y1 which is the same as x2 that's 11. so we need to set this function equal to 11. 11 minus 3 is 8 and the cube root of 8 is 2 so x1 is 2 which means that y2 is 2. so now that we have the value of x1 we can now find the value of the derivative of the inverse function so the formula is this the derivative of the inverse function is 1 over the derivative of the original function so x2 is 11. we have that here and this is going to be 1 over f prime where x1 is 2. so let's find f prime of x that's going to be 3x squared so f prime of 2 is going to be 3 times 2 squared which is 2 squared is four times three that's twelve so the answer is one over twelve now let's see if we can get the same answer using implicit differentiation so we have y one is equal to x one cubed plus 3. now to find the derivative of the inverse function we need to switch x and y because right now we're dealing with the original function so once we switch x and y we're going to have this x is equal to y to the third plus three but because we switched x and y the subscripts will change so i'm gonna put the subscript of two which tells us that we're dealing with the inverse function as opposed to the original function now let's differentiate both sides with respect to x so the derivative of x is one the derivative of y to the third is three y squared times d y d x and the derivative of the constant three is zero now keep in mind the subscript for this is two to solve for dydx we need to divide by 3y squared so dydx represents the derivative of the inverse function and that's 1 over three y squared with a subscript of two now y two is two so this becomes one over three times two squared which is one over twelve and so that gives you the same answer but you need to know that you're dealing with y two and not y one so be careful of that and that's why it's important to write this so you don't get confused whether you should plug in 11 or 2 because that's where most students get mixed up with so this is just a method that helps you to keep track of everything let's try another example let's say that f of x is equal to x raised to the third power plus four x minus two and let's say that we want to evaluate the derivative of the inverse function when x is 3. go ahead and find the answer for this so first we need to determine these variables x1 y1 and x2 and y2 now the number that's inside the inverse function that will always represent x2 and recall that these two they share the same value so y1 is 3 as well now we need to determine x1 and keep in mind f of x1 is y1 so this is f of x1 and these are x1 values so y1 is x sub 1 raised to the third power plus four x sub one minus two now we have the value of y one and it's equal to three so three is equal to x cubed plus four x minus two so what is the value of x if we subtract both sides by 3 we can't really factor it unless we use like synthetic division or something but maybe we can guess the number let's add 3 to both sides negative 2 actually we need to subtract 3 from both sides so negative 2 minus 3 that's negative 5. now there's something called the leading coefficient test where you look at the constant term and the leading coefficient and the factors of 5 are 1 and 5 and the possible zeros of this function could be plus or minus one or plus or minus five so let's start by plugging in one if we plug in one the one to the third plus four times one minus five does equal zero so x one is equal to one if we plug in negative one it will be negative one minus four minus five that doesn't equal to zero if we plug in five five to the third plus four times five minus five that doesn't equal zero and if we plug the negative five that's not going to work either so this is the only one that can work if you use the leading coefficient test so x1 is one which means that y2 is also one now as soon as you complete this you can get the answer so let's write the formula the derivative of the inverse function is equal to 1 over f prime of x sub 1. so x two is three x sub one is one so now let's determine f prime of x it's going to be three x squared plus four so f prime of one is going to be three times one squared plus four which is seven so this is one over f prime of one so the answer is one over seven now let's confirm the answer using implicit differentiation so we know that y one is equal to x sub 1 raised to the third power plus 4x minus 2. now for the inverse function we need to switch x and y so x will be equal to y to the third plus four y minus two now because we're dealing with the inverse function the subscripts will change from one to two so this is x sub two and these are y sub two now let's find the derivative of both sides with respect to x the derivative of x on the left is simply equal to one on the right the derivative of y to the third is going to be three y squared times d y d x and the derivative of four y is four times d y d x and for a constant it's zero so what we need to do is factor out d y d x and so this is gonna be three y squared plus four now don't forget the subscript is two so now we need to divide both sides by this term so dydx that is the first derivative of the inverse function it's 1 divided by 3y squared with a subscript of two plus four now keep in mind x one and y two the same so you can rewrite d y d x as one over three x sub one squared plus 4. you can do that if you want since these two are the same but let's not worry about that so now let's plug in y2 so y two in this example is one so d y d the derivative of the inverse function is one over three times one squared plus four and so that's three plus four which is seven so the final answer one over seven and that's how you can confirm your answer using implicit differentiation you 

Transcript for: Basic Differentiation Rules For Derivatives
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the derivative of a function and so we're going to go over some basic differentiation rules that you need to know the first one is the power rule the derivative of x raised to the n is going to be n times x raised to the n minus one so based on that formula what is the derivative of x to the second power in this case n is 2 so it's going to be 2 x raised to the 2 minus 1 or 2x to the first power and so that's the answer for the first example based on that try these two determine the derivative of x cubed and x raised to the fourth power so in this case n is 3 so it's going to be 3 x to the 3 minus 1 or 3 x squared now for the next example n is 4 so it's going to be 4 x raised to the 4 minus 1 or 4x cubed and so that's how you could use the power rule to find the derivative of a function now what about this one what is the derivative of x go ahead and try that example so this is basically x raised to the first power so thus n is one so it's going to be one x to the one minus one which is one x to the zero anything raised to the zero power is one so we just get one now what about like the derivative of five x what's going to be the answer now if you have a constant in front of the variable you can move the constant to the front so this is the same as 5 times the derivative of x and the derivative of x is one so five times one will give us five the derivative of let's say negative seven x is simply negative seven now what about the derivative of a constant the derivative of any constant is zero now one way that you can remember that is you can write eight as eight times x is zero because x to the zero is one and so these two they're the same so this is eight times the derivative of x raised to the zero and using the power rule it's going to be zero x raised to the zero minus one and zero times anything is zero so the whole thing is just going to be zero so make sure you remember that the derivative of any constant is always equal to zero here's another one find the derivative of nine x to the fourth and also seven x to the fifth power so this is gonna be nine times the derivative of x to the fourth which is four x raised to the 4 minus 1 or 4 x cubed and then you just got to multiply 9 times 4. so the answer is going to be 36 x to the third power for the next one it's going to be seven times the derivative of x to the fifth which is five x to the fourth power and then seven times 5 that's 35 so you get 35 x raised to the fourth power now what about the derivative of let's say a polynomial function four x to the fifth plus seven x cubed minus nine x plus five go ahead and try that so the derivative of x to the fifth is going to be 5x to the fourth power the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of x is one the derivative of a constant is zero so four times five is twenty seven times three is twenty one and this is going to be it so it's twenty x to the fourth plus twenty one x squared minus nine so you just have to differentiate each term separately now what about this one what is the derivative of the square root of x ahead and try that for this example we need to rewrite it this is x raised to the first power but within a square root symbol and the index number is a 2 if you don't see a number there and so the way you rewrite it is like this it's going to be x to the one-half now we can use the power rule so it's one-half times x raised to the one-half minus one one half minus one is the same as one over two minus two over two two divided by two is the same as one and so this becomes negative one half so we get one half x raised to the minus one-half now whenever you have a negative exponent you need to move the variable to the bottom of the fraction so we're gonna put x in the denominator of the fraction so the exponent will change from negative one-half to positive one-half and recall that x to the one-half is the same as the square root of x so at this point we can replace x to the one half with the square root of x and so this is the first derivative of that function the square root of x function let's try another radical function let's use the seventh root of x to the fourth power so the first thing we need to do is rewrite it this is going to be x raised to the four over seven and now we could use the power rule so it's four over seven times x raised to the four over seven minus one so four over seven minus one is the same as four over seven minus seven over seven which will be negative three over seven and so this is going to be 4 over 7 x raised to the negative 3 over 7. so once again we have a negative exponent which means we need to move the variable to the bottom of the fraction so the 4 is going to be on top the 7 is going to be on the bottom with the x variable and we're going to change the negative exponent to a positive exponent and then at this point we can turn it back into its radical form so it's four over seven times the seventh root of x cubed now if you want to you can rationalize the denominator but i'm not going to worry about that in this example so i'm going to leave the answer like this and so that's how you could find the derivative of a radical function now what about the derivative of a rational function like this one what is the derivative of one divided by x raised to the fifth power so once again we need to rewrite it before we could use the power rule so what we're going to do is we're going to take the x variable and move it to the top and as you do so the exponent will change sign it's going to flip from positive 5 to negative 5. so now we could use the power rule n is negative five so it's going to be negative five times x raised to the negative five minus one which is negative five x to the negative six so this is the answer but we wanna rewrite it since we have a negative exponent we're going to move the x variable back to the bottom so the final answer is going to be negative 5 over x to the sixth power and so that's how you could find the derivative of a rational function now let's talk about the derivative of trigonometric functions so here are some notes that you need to take down the derivative of sine x is cosine x and the derivative of cosine x is negative sine x next you need to know the derivative of tangent x and that's going to be secant squared now what do you think the derivative of cotangent x is equal to it's going to be negative cosecant squared now the derivative of secant x is secant x tangent x based on that what do you think the derivative of cosecant x is going to be this is going to be negative cosecant x times cotangent x and notice this pattern so anytime you have a trig function that starts with a c notice that in the derivative they all have a negative sign so that can help you to remember the derivative of the six trigonometric functions so if you know the derivative of sine tangent and secant you can easily find the derivative of cosine cotangent cosecant looking at the similar relationships between what you see on the left side and what you see on the right side now what about this one find the derivative of five sine x minus seven tangent x plus cosecant x so all we need to do is differentiate each one separately the derivative of 5 sine x is going to be 5 times the derivative of sine x which is cosine x now once you differentiate sine next we need to differentiate tangent the derivative of negative 7 tan x is going to be negative 7 times secant squared since that's the derivative of tangent and the derivative of cosecant we said it's negative cosecant cotangent and so this is the answer 5 cosine x minus 7 secant squared x minus 4 cosecant x cotangent x so that's how you could find the derivative of trigonometric functions now let's talk about the derivatives of exponential functions involving the base e here's a formula that you're going to find useful the derivative of e to the u where u is a function of x is e to the u times u prime so for instance let's say if we want to find the derivative of e to the x it's going to be e to the x so u is x times the derivative of x which is one so the answer is just e to the x based on that what is the derivative of e to the seven x go ahead and try that so it's gonna be e to the seven x times the derivative of seven x which is seven so it's 7 e to the 7x let's work on some more examples try these three examples so using this formula find the derivative of e raised to the 4x plus 3 and the derivative of e to the x squared and also the derivative of 5 e to the x cubed so for the first one it's going to be the same thing e to the 4x plus 3 and then times the derivative of 4x plus 3 which is just 4. so it's 4 e to the 4x plus 3. now for the second one it's going to be the same thing e to the x squared times the derivative of x squared which is 2x and so it's 2x e to the x squared and for the last one it's going to be what we started with times the derivative of x cubed which is 3x squared and so we could multiply 5 and 3 and that's going to give us 15 x squared e to the x cubed and so now you know how to find the derivative of exponential functions with the base e next let's talk about finding the derivative of logarithmic functions particularly the natural log function the derivative of ln u where u is once again a function of x is u prime divided by u so let's say if we want to find the derivative of ln x so in this case u is x u prime the derivative of x is one so u prime is one u is x so the answer is just one over x let's try another example let's find the derivative of the natural log of x squared plus five so u is that's the stuff inside the natural log that's x squared plus five u prime the derivative of x squared plus five is just two x so it's going to be u prime divided by u and so the answer is two x over x squared plus five for the sake of practice try this one find the derivative of three times the natural log of five x plus four so u the u variable is going to be 5 x plus 4 and u prime is the derivative of 5 x plus 4. the derivative of 5x is 5 and the derivative of the constant 4 is 0. so it's just 5. now we do have a constant in front of the natural log so we're going to rewrite that here so it's going to be 3 times this thing u prime which is 5 divided by u which is five x plus four so now we can multiply three times five and that's going to be fifteen so the answer is fifteen over five x plus 4. so now you know how to find the derivative of natural logarithmic functions now for those of you who want more example problems are not just natural logs but logarithmic functions exponential functions and other things like implicit differentiation and things like that check out the links in the description section below and i'm going to post more video resources that can help you with derivatives now the next thing we need to talk about is the product rule the best time to use the product rule is when you have two things multiplied to each other let's say u and v so what you need to do is you need to differentiate one of these two functions so if you differentiate u first leave the other one alone and then it's going to be plus we're going to leave the first function the way it is and differentiate the second one so the derivative of u times v is going to be u prime v plus uv prime i need to draw the u better so this is a u that's a v now let's work on some examples what is the derivative of x squared times sine x so in this case u is x squared which means u prime is 2x v v is going to be sine x so v prime is cosine x so it's going to be u prime times v plus u times v prime which is cosine and so this is the answer 2x sine x plus x squared cosine x now let's try another one what is the derivative of x cubed ln x so in this case we're going to say v is ln and u is x cubed so let's write that u is x cubed v is ln x u prime the derivative of x cubed is going to be three x squared and v prime the derivative of l and x is going to be one over x so it's u prime v three x squared times ln x plus u v prime x cubed times one over x now we could simplify x cubed times one over x that's the same as x cubed divided by x which is just x squared so this is the answer now if you want to you can factor out the gcf you can take out x squared and it's going to leave you with 3 ln x plus 1. so you can write your answer like this and so that's how you could use the product rule to uh differentiate certain functions now there's also the quotient rule and the chain rule but i'm not going to go over that in this video instead i'm going to post some links to some other videos where i cover those topics so feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance and don't forget to subscribe to this channel thanks again for watching 

Transcript for: Differentiation Formulas - Notes
in this video we're going to go over some differentiation formulas particularly if you're studying derivatives in calculus so if you have a sheet of paper with you feel free to get ready to take down some notes so the first thing you want to be familiar with is the derivative of a constant the derivative of a constant is always a zero the next Formula you need to know is the power rule or the derivative of a power function here we have a variable raised to a constant it's going to be that constant times the variable raised to the N minus 1. so for instance the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared the derivative of x to the fourth is 4X cubed the derivative of x to the fifth is five x to the fourth so that's how you can employ the power rule to find the derivatives of functions like this now instead of having a variable raised to a constant what if we have a constant raised to a variable the derivative of a to the x is going to be a to the x times Ln a now the reason why we get that is because the derivative of x is one but let's say we have the derivative of a to the U where a is a constant but U is a function of x this is going to be a to the U times the derivative of U times Ln a here we would have the derivative of x but that's just going to be 1. now if you ever get this the derivative of a variable raised to a variable this rather than having a formula you need to employ a process called logarithmic differentiation and I have a video on YouTube that covers that so if you go to the YouTube search bar and type in logarithmic differentiation organic chemistry tutor you should see a video that will come up and explain how to do problems like this next up we have something called the constant multiple rule so if you have if you're trying to find the derivative of a function multiplied by some constant C it's simply going to be that constant times the derivative of that function so for instance let's say if we want to find the derivative of 5x to the 4. we know the derivative of x to the 4 but we can rewrite this as 5. times the derivative of x to the fourth and using the power rule we know this is going to be 5 times 4X cubed which becomes 20x cubed the next Formula you need to be familiar with is the power rule so if we have two functions u and v and they're multiplied to each other the derivative of the product of these two functions is going to be U Prime V plus UV Prime so it's the derivative of U times V plus u times the derivative of V next up we have the quotient rule so here we have a fraction of two functions or a division of two functions and it's going to be v u Prime minus u v Prime over V squared so that's the formula associated with the quotient rule now sometimes you may need to find the derivative of a composite function in this case you need to use a chain rule so let's say we have f of G of U we want to find the derivative of that so first we're going to find the derivative of the outer function f we're going to keep the inside part the same and then we're going to multiply by the derivative of the inside part that is the derivative of G and then we'll multiply by the derivative of the inside of G which is U so that will be times U Prime now you might see the chain rule represented as a function of X instead of U so let's say if you have this F of G of x it's going to be the derivative of the outside function we'll keep the inside part the same and then times the derivative of the inside function now the derivative of x is one so there's no point writing that it would just be times one so if you have X this is all you need but if you have a function U or a function like where use a function of X you're also going to have U Prime at the end so keep that in mind so you got to differentiate the outer function f and then work your way towards the middle then G and then U now for those of you who want additional example problems on this check out the links in the description section below now let's continue let's talk about another form of the chain rule when it's combined with the power rule so let's say we want to find the derivative of the function f of x but it's raised to the n so first we're going to focus on the outside part we're going to keep the inside part the same so it's going to be n times f of x to the N raised to the N minus 1. much like the power rule where was n X raised to the N minus 1. but we do have a function on the inside it's not just X it's a function of X so now we've got to find the derivative of the inside so we're going to multiply it by the derivative of the inside so this combines the power rule with a chain rule another formula that's associated with the chain rule is this one d y d x is equal to d y d u times d u over DX now let's talk about the derivative of logarithmic functions so let's say we want to find the derivative of log base a of U where U is a function of x it's going to be U Prime over U LNA if we want to find the derivative of the natural log of U keep in mind the base of a natural log of E it's going to be U Prime over U it's the same as this one the only issue is Ln e is equal to one so you could write it as just U on the bottom so those are the two formulas you need to be familiar with when finding the derivatives of logarithmic functions now let's focus on trig functions the derivative of sine of U is going to be cosine U times U Prime now if you just have sine X the derivative of sine X is simply cosine X you could think of it as cosine X and the derivative of x is one so it's just cosine X but let's say if you was x squared if you want to find the derivative of sine X Squared it's going to be cosine x squared and then times the derivative of x squared which would be 2X so this is the U part and this is the U Prime part that's why I like to write it in this format it reminds you that you'll need to employ the chain rule if you have something other than x as the angle now the derivative of cosine U this is going to be negative sine U times U Prime the derivative of tangent of U is secant squared times U Prime now for cotangent it's going to be negative cosecant squared and as always times U Prime now the next two that you need to know are the derivative of secant and the derivative of secant's cousin or cosecant and they're quite similar if there's a c in front typically it's going to have a negative sign the derivative of secant is you know what let's change this let's change it from X to a u the derivative of secant U is going to be secant U tangent U times U Prime the derivative of cosecant use negative cosecant U cotangent U times U Prime now the next set of formos need to be familiar with are the inverse trig formulas so let's start with the derivative of the inverse of sine of U so that's U Prime over the square root of 1 minus U squared now just for comparison purposes if you have the inverse sine of x it's going to be 1 over the square root of 1 minus x squared because the derivative of x is one you're going to have that there but if you have U you can have U Prime instead of one so make sure you're mindful of that difference now the derivative for the inverse cosine of U is going to be very similar to the derivative of sine the only difference is it's going to have a negative sign but everything else is going to be the same now let's move to the arc tangent function so the derivative of inverse tan of U it's going to be U Prime over 1 plus u squared now for Arc cotangent it's going to be negative U Prime over 1 plus u squared next up we have inverse secant and the formula for that is going to be U Prime over U square root U squared minus 1. and for inverse cosecant it's negative U Prime over U square root U squared minus 1. so those are the formulas for the derivatives of the inverse trig functions so that's it for this video so if you're studying for a derivatives test at least you know the most common formula is that you'll need and that you can be tested on so hopefully you wrote those down and thanks for watching 

Transcript for: Derivatives for Beginners - Basic Introduction
in this video we're going to talk about how to find derivatives so the first thing we're going to talk about is the derivative of a constant what you need to know is that the derivative of any constant is always zero so for example the derivative of seven is zero the derivative of a constant like negative four that's also zero pi is just a number there's no variable to it so the derivative of pi is zero the derivative of pi to the e that's also zero both pi and e they're just a number so if you don't have a variable if you just have a constant the derivative of any constant is always zero now the next thing we need to talk about is something known as the power rule let's say if we have a variable raised to a constant such as x raised to the nth power this is equal to n times x raised to the n minus one so let me give you some examples let's say we want to find the derivative of x to the second power in this case n is 2. this is going to be 2 x raised to the 2 minus 1 which is 2x to the first power in short you need to move the exponent to the front and then subtract this by one so let me give you some more examples let's say we want to find the derivative of x cubed so what we're going to do is move the 3 to the front so it's going to be three x and then we're gonna take away one from three three minus one is two so it's two x squared the derivative of x to the fourth that's to be 4 x cubed and the derivative of x to the fifth power that's 5 x to the fourth power so hopefully you see the pattern here but that's the power rule that's how you can use it so with that in mind what do you think the derivative of 4 x to the fifth power is equal to so this is the same as multiplying four by the derivative of x to the fifth power and we could use the power rule on that part the derivative of x to the fifth power is x to the fourth power and then we could simply multiply four and five and this is going to be 20 x to the fourth power so this is known as the constant multiple rule go ahead and try these two examples the derivative of 6 x to the 8th power and also the derivative of 5 x to the third power so let's start with the first one we're going to rewrite the constant 6 and then multiply by the derivative of x to the 8th power so moving the 8 to the front it's going to be 6 times 8 times x and then we're going to subtract 8 by 1 which is 7 so it's 6 times 8x to the seventh power and then we can multiply 6 by 8 that's going to be 48 times x to the seventh power so that's the answer for the first example for the second one it's going to be 5 times the derivative of x cubed which is 3x squared and then 5 times 3 is 15. so the answer is 15 x squared now let's say we have some polynomial function f of x is equal to let's say 4x cubed plus seven x squared minus nine x plus five so what is the derivative of this function by the way the notation for the derivative of a function is f prime of x so if we take the derivative of f of x this is going to equal f prime of x for those of you who might be wondering so for this problem we just got to take it one step at a time first let's find the derivative of 4x cubed it's going to be 4 times the derivative of x cubed which is 3x squared and then next we need to find the derivative of 7x squared so it's going to be 7 times the derivative of x squared which is 2x now what about the derivative of negative 9x what is that equal to well first we need to know what the derivative of x is equal to x is the same as x to the first power so using the power rule we can move the exponent to the front it's going to be 1 x and then if we subtract that number by one we get zero anything raised to the zero power is one so the derivative of x for instance is one the derivative of five x is going to be five times one or five the derivative of negative seven x is simply negative seven so the derivative of negative nine x is simply going to be negative nine and we know that the derivative of a constant that is a number without a variable it's always 0. so the answer for this example is going to be 4 times 3 which is 12 7 times 2 is 14. and so it's going to be 12x squared plus 14x minus 9. so that is the derivative of the original function now let's work on finding the derivative of a rational function what is the derivative of 1 over x squared how would you find the answer for this one well it turns out that you could use the power rule but you need to rewrite the expression first the first thing you need to do is move the x variable to the top as you do so the sign of the exponent changes from positive 2 to negative 2. so you can write it like this or you can simply just write it as x to the minus 2. it's the same so now using the power rule we can move the exponent to the front this is going to be negative two x and then we need to subtract the exponent by one negative two minus one is negative three so this is our answer but we can simplify it or rewrite it a bit what you want to do is get rid of the negative exponent so you want to move the x variable back to the bottom thus we're going to have a negative 2 on top and x raised to the positive 3 on the bottom this is the final answer in its simplified form so that's the derivative of 1 over x squared let's try another example what is the derivative of one over x cubed feel free to pause the video if you want to work on it step one we need to rewrite the expression let's move the x variable to the top so this is equal to the derivative of x to the negative three and now let's use the power rule let's move the exponent to the front and so it's gonna be negative three x and then let's subtract that number by one so negative 3 minus 1 is negative 4. finally let's move the x variable back to the bottom and so this is going to be negative 3 over x raised to the fifth power actually i need to make a slight correction that's negative 3 over x to the fourth power that should be a 4. so this is the answer to the problem now let's work on the next problem let's find the derivative of negative six over x to the fifth power go ahead and work on that so like before we're going to move the x variable to the top so the first step is to rewrite the problem so this is going to be negative six x to the negative fifth power over one now let's move the exponent to the front so we're gonna have negative 6 times negative 5 and then it's going to be x and then let's subtract negative 5 by 1. negative 5 minus 1 is negative 6. so what we're going to do next is we're going to move the x variable back to the bottom and we're going to multiply those two numbers negative 6 times negative 5 that's positive 30 and we have x to the 6 on the bottom so this is the derivative of negative 6 over x to the fifth power so now you know how to find the derivative of a rational function let's move on to finding the derivative of a radical function what is the derivative of the square root of x how can we find the answer to that well it's important to know that the exponent is 1 and the index number is 2. so like before we need to rewrite this problem we can rewrite the square root of x as x to the one-half now in this form we could use the power rule so we're going to move the exponent to the front this is going to be one half x and then we're going to subtract the exponent by one so one half minus one we could change one to two over two so it becomes one minus two which is negative one over the same denominator of two so one half minus one is negative a half so now at this point we can rewrite the expression so this is equivalent to saying x raised to the negative one half divided by two and now let's move the exponent i mean the the variable back to the bottom so it's going to be 1 over 2 x to the one half and now at this point we can replace x to the one-half with what we had at the beginning the square root of x so the final answer is 1 over 2 times the square root of x now let's work on this example let's find the derivative of the cube root of x to the fifth power go ahead and take a minute to work on it feel free to pause the video by the way if you want to try any of these examples so let's begin by rewriting the expression the cube root of x to the fifth power is the same as x raised to the five over three and now let's take the derivative by moving the exponent to the front so it's going to be five over three x and now we need to subtract that by one so five over three minus one well we need to get common denominators in order to subtract these two numbers so we're going to change one into three over three because three divided by three is one and now we can subtract the numerators of the two fractions five minus three is two and the denominator is going to stay the same so five over three minus three over three is two over three that's going to be our new exponent and so you can move this x to the top and write it as 5 x raised to the 2 3 divided by 3. notice that we have a positive exponent so we're not going to move the x variable to the bottom and get a negative exponent there's no need to do that in this problem the only thing that we do need to do is convert this expression from an exponential fraction into a radical expression so x raised to the two thirds can be rewritten as the cube root of x squared so make sure you understand this the b root of x to the a is equal to x raised to the a over b the number inside the radical goes on top of the fraction the index number goes on the bottom of the exponential fraction but for this problem this is the final answer now let's work on one more example of differentiating radical functions so let's say we have the eighth root of x to the fifth power go ahead and find the derivative of that so let's begin by rewriting the expression so the eighth root of x to the fifth is the same as x raised to the five over eight power so now we're gonna move the exponent to the front just like before this is going to be 5 over 8 x now let's subtract the exponent by 1. we're following the same steps so let's get common denominators let's replace negative 1 with negative 8 over eight five minus eight is minus three so this is going to be negative three over eight so we can rewrite this as five x to the negative three over eight over eight now this time we do have a negative exponent so we're going to move the x variable to the bottom of the fraction so it's 5 over 8 x raised to the 3 over 8. now the next thing we're going to do is convert the exponential fraction back into its radical form so x to the three eighths is the same as the eighth root of x cubed and we're going to leave the answer like this now if you want to you could rationalize the denominator but that's a whole other topic i'm going to leave the answer in this form now let's move on to finding the derivatives of trigonometric functions so for now hopefully you could take out a sheet of paper and a pen or pencil and jot down some notes the derivative of sine of the u variable where u is a function of x is going to be cosine of that u variable times the derivative of u or times u prime the derivative of cosine u is going to be negative sign of the u variable times u prime the derivative of tangent u is going to be positive secant squared u times u prime the derivative of cotangent u is going to be negative cosecant squared of u times u prime the derivative of secant is secant tangent times u prime so hopefully you see a pattern here and finally the derivative of cosecant is going to be negative cosecant cotangent times u prime so note that every time you differentiate a trig function that starts over c you're going to have a negative sign that's one thing you want to keep in mind the derivative of tangent and cotangent is similar to each other this is secant squared that's cosecant squared and the derivative of secant and cosecant are also similar to each other this is secant tangent this is cosecant cotangent so hopefully that will help you to remember these trigonometric derivatives now let's try some example problems let's start with this one what is the derivative of sine x well we know that the derivative of sine to the u is going to be cosine u times u prime in this example we can clearly see that u is equal to x if u is equal to x what's u prime well we know that the derivative of x is simply one so this is going to be cosine x times one or just simply cosine x here's another example what is the derivative of sine x to the third power try that one so let's rewrite the formula the derivative of sine to the u is going to be cosine of u times u prime so the derivative of sine x cubed well first we know that u is x cubed so u prime is going to be 3x squared and then if we just replace u with x cubed and u prime with 3x squared we're gonna get the answer so notice the process that we're taking here first we differentiate side it turns into cosine whatever is inside of the sine function that is the angle it remains the same in the answer so the angle of sine is x cubed the angle of cosine remains x cubed next we take the derivative of the inside part of the function x cubed and that gives us 3x squared so now let's move on to some other examples the derivative of cosine x squared try that one and also try the derivative of tangent raised to the x to the fifth power i mean tangent of x to the fifth power so first we're going to find the derivative of cosine the derivative of cosine is negative sine and we're going to keep the angle the same so the angle is x squared next we're going to find the derivative of x squared which is 2x so the final answer is negative 2x sine x squared now moving on to the next example the derivative of tangent is secant squared now the angle of tangent is x to the fifth so the angle of secant squared will be the same thing next we're going to find the derivative of x to the fifth power which is 5x to the fourth power so the final answer is 5x to the fourth power times secant squared x to the fifth power now what about the derivative of secant 4x what's the answer to that one the derivative of secant is secant tangent so it's going to be secant 4x tangent 4x the angle is going to remain the same after that we could find the derivative of 4x which is just 4. and i'm going to move the 4 to the front so the derivative of secant 4x is going to be 4 secant 4x tangent 4x now what about the derivative of let's say cotangent x cubed plus x raised to the fifth power the derivative of cotangent is negative cosecant squared so we're going to have negative cosecant squared and then whatever we have inside of the angle of cotangent that's going to be the same for the angle of cosecant squared which is x cubed plus x to the fifth power next we need to find the derivative of the inside angle the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of x to the fifth is 5x to the fourth and so i'm going to leave the answer like that but if you want to rewrite it you could rewrite it like this you could say negative 3x squared plus 5x to the fourth power times cosecant squared x cubed plus x to the fifth power so that's the answer for this example now let's move on to the derivatives of natural logs the derivative of ln u this is equal to u prime divided by u so let's say if we want to find the derivative of the natural log of x in this case u is equal to x u prime the derivative of x is going to be one so it's u prime over u or just one over x so that's the derivative of the natural log of x now let's try some more examples so what if we want to find the derivative of let's say the natural log of x cubed what's the answer well we can see that u is equal to x cubed u prime is three x squared so it's u prime over u that's three x squared over x cubed x squared is basically x times x x cube is x times x times x so we can cross out two x variables and this is going to give us three over x as a final answer that's one way in which you can get the answer here's another way a property of logs and natural logs allows you to move the exponent to the front this is without differentiation by the way so we can rewrite the expression as 3 times ln x now from the previous example we know that the derivative of ln x is 1 over x so the derivative of 3 ln x is 3 times 1 over x which is the same as 3 over x so that's another way in which you can find the derivative of that particular natural log function go ahead and try this one find the derivative of ln x to the fourth minus x to the fifth so we can see that u is x to the fourth minus x to the fifth u prime is the derivative of that it's four x cubed minus five x to the fourth so the answer is going to be the derivative of what we see inside the natural log function divided by whatever is inside of it and that's really an easier way to like think about it in order to find the answer so let's say if we want to find the derivative of the natural log of tangent x so first take the derivative of the inside part of ln the derivative of tangent is secant squared and then simply divided by whatever is inside of the natural log function which is tangent so the answer is secant squared over tangent but chances are we can reduce this expression secant is one over cosine so secant squared is going to be one over cosine squared tangent is sine over cosine so what we could do is multiply the top and the bottom by i'm going to multiply by cosine squared these two will cancel and i'm going to get one on top one of the cosines will cancel leaving one cosine here so i'm going to get sine times cosine which we can write that as one over sine times one over cosine one over sine is cosecant x and one over cosine is secant x so the final answer is cosecant x times secant x so now that we've talked about how to find the derivative of a natural log function let's talk about how we could find the derivative of a regular logarithmic function such as log base a of u this is going to be equal to u prime over u ln a now i'm going to compare that to the derivative of the natural log of u we said is u prime over u now notice that here we have a base a and it turns into lna the base of a natural log is e and what we should have here is l and e so these two are essentially the same thing instead of a we have e but the natural log of e we need to know is equal to one so because of that we really don't need this expression here but i want you to compare and see the similarities between the two equations so let's find the derivative of let's say log base 2 of x to the fifth power go ahead and try that u in this example is what we see here x to the fifth power and a is two u prime the derivative of x to the fifth power that's going to be five x to the fourth power so all we got to do is plug in the information into that formula and we're going to get the answer so it's u prime divided by u times the natural log of a or ln2 now we can simplify our answer x to the fifth power i can rewrite that as x to the fourth power times x because 1 plus 4 is 5. and so we can cancel x to the fourth power that's the final answer is going to be 5 over x ln 2. now remember you could move this 5 to the front and that's we see that here so that's the final simplified answer for in that problem let's try another problem with regular logs so let's say we have log base 4 of x cubed plus 4x squared let's try that one so u is going to be whatever we see inside of the log expression so it's x cubed plus 4x squared a is the base of the log expression a is 4 and u prime is just the derivative of what we see inside of here the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared the derivative of 4x squared is 4 times 2x or 8x and so plugging everything into that formula it's going to be u prime which is 3x squared plus 8x divided by u which is xq plus 4x squared and then times the natural log of a or ln 4. now you could leave your answer like this but understand that you could simplify this expression in the numerator we can factor out x and we'll be left with three x plus eight in the denominator we can take out an x squared which i'm gonna write as x times x if we take out x squared we're gonna be left with x plus 4 and then times ln 4. so now we can cross out an x variable so we can leave our answer as 3x plus 8 divided by x times x plus four times the natural log of four or you can just rewrite that part as x squared plus four x there's many ways in which you can write your final answer hopefully your teacher won't be too picky about exactly how she wants you to leave your final answer but that's it so that's how you could find the derivative of this logarithmic function now let's move on to our next topic and that is the derivative of exponential functions so let's say we have a constant raised to a variable before we had a variable raised to a constant which would use the power rule but now we have a constant raised to a variable and this is going to equal that constant raised to that variable times the derivative of that variable so let's put this information to practice let's say if we want to find the derivative of e to the x so it's going to be e to the x times the derivative of x which is 1. so the derivative of e to the x is simply e raised to the x power now what about the derivative of e to the 2x it's going to be the same thing e to the 2x times the derivative of 2x which is 2. so you can write it as 2e to the 2x now let's work on some other examples what is the derivative of e to the 5x it's going to be e to the 5x times 5 which is 5e to the 5x and then finally if we have the derivative of e to the x squared it's going to be the same thing e to the x squared times the derivative of x squared which is 2x and let's do one more let's say we want to find the derivative of e to the sine x this is going to be e raised to the sine x times the derivative of sine x which is cosine x so that's how you could differentiate an exponential function with a base e now what if the base is not e let's say it's some number other than e because e is a special number it's equal to 2.7182818 so and it just continues but what if we have let's say some other constant raise the u variable what's the derivative of that it's going to be the same thing a to the u times u prime but times lna if we contrast that with e to the u which is e to the u times u prime but technically times l and e but ln e is one so we don't need that part when dealing with e it's just e to u times u prime but if the constant is a number other than e then you need to add the l and a part to the answer so let's put this to practice let's say we want to find the derivative of 5 raised to the x power this is going to be the same thing 5 raised to the x times the derivative of x which is 1. times the natural log of five so based on that go ahead and try these examples find the derivative of four raised to the x squared and also the derivative of seven raised to the x to the fourth so this is going to be whatever we see here so we're just going to rewrite it that's 4 raised to the x squared and then times u prime u in this example is x squared so the derivative of x squared is 2x and then times the natural log of whatever the base is the base in this example is 4. for the next one is going to be exactly what we started with 7 raised to the x to the fourth times the derivative of the exponent the derivative of x to the fourth is four x cubed times the natural log of the base and the base is uh seven so that's the derivative of seven x to the fourth you simply need to just follow the equation as you can see this is the a to the u part u prime that's the derivative of the exponent and then lna we can see a is seven now the next topic of discussion is the product rule so let's say you have a function multiplied to another function u times v what is the derivative of u times v well first you need to differentiate the first part leave the second part the same plus leave the first part the same differentiate the second part so let's say we have the derivative of x cubed times sine x in this example you could say that u is x cubed and v is sine x so we're going to differentiate the first part that is x cubed the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and then we're going to leave the second part the same so we're just going to rewrite sine x plus now we're going to rewrite the first part x cubed and then take the derivative of the second part the derivative of sine x is cosine x so this is the answer now for those of you who want to simplify it you could factor out the gcf which is x squared if you decide to do that here's what you're going to get taking out x squared in the first term you'll be left with 3 sine x taking out x squared in the second term you'll be left with x cosine x so you could leave your answer in this format if you want to now let's try another example what is the derivative of x squared l and x so feel free to pause the video if you want to try that so this is u and this is v so let's begin by differentiating the first part x squared so we're going to get 2x and then we're going to rewrite the second part ln x we're not going to change that plus let's rewrite the first part x squared and then let's take the derivative of the second part the derivative of l and x is one over x so we're going to get 2x ln x and then x squared times 1 over x that's like x squared divided by x which is x now like before we can factor on x if we do so we're going to get 2 ln x plus 1. so that's the final answer if we wish to simplify it that far so now you know how to use the product rule when finding derivatives here's another example so let's say we have seven x plus four times x squared plus eight now we could use the product rule to find the derivative of this expression or we can foil and then use the power rule to find the derivative of the resultant polynomial function but let's use the product rule so first let's find the derivative of the first part seven x plus four the derivative of seven x is seven the derivative of four is zero so we just get seven next we're going to rewrite the second part and then we're going to rewrite the first part and then take the derivative of the second part the derivative of x squared is 2x the derivative of the constant 8 is 0. so this is the answer that we get now what i'm going to do is i'm going to distribute and combine like terms so this is going to be 7x squared plus 56 and this is going to be 14 x squared plus 8x so i can combine 7x squared and 14x squared so i'm going to get 21x squared plus 8x plus 56. and so this is the final answer now note the other way in which we can get the answer we could have initially distributed before we take the derivative 7x times x squared is 7x cubed and then this is 7x times 8 which is 56x this is 4x squared and this 4 times 8 is 32. now if we were to take the derivative of 7x cubed that's going to be 7 times 3x squared which is 21x squared the derivative of 4x squared is 8x and the derivative of 56x is 56. the derivative of the constant is 0. so we would still get the same answer in the end now let's talk about the quotient rule let's say if we have a function divided by another function or u over v to find the derivative of that expression we could use this formula it's going to be v u prime minus u v prime over v squared so let's say we want to find the derivative of three x minus five over seven x plus four now if you want to it helps to write down a few things so u is whatever is on the numerator of the fraction so we can say that u is three x minus five v is the stuff on the bottom or on the denominator of the fraction so that's seven x plus four u prime the derivative of three x minus five is just three v prime in this example is simply seven so now we just gotta plug in everything into that formula so it's v that's seven x plus four times u prime which is three and then minus u that's three x minus five times the v prime which is seven divided by v squared so that's seven x plus four squared now let's do some algebra so let's begin by distributing the three to seven x and 4. 7x times 3 is 21x 4 times 3 is 12. next let's distribute 7 to 3x and keep in mind it's a negative sign so that's going to be negative 21x and then 7 times negative 5 combined with that negative sign that's going to be positive 35. so immediately we could see that we could cancel the 21x and then we can combine 12 and 35 which will be 47. so the final answer is 47 divided by 7x plus 4 squared for this problem so that's how you can use the quotient rule whenever you have a division of two functions now let's talk about the chain rule we've covered some examples of it early in this video what is the derivative of sine x to the fifth power from what we talked about we would differentiate the outer part of the function the derivative of sine is cosine and then we would keep the inside the same and then we would differentiate the inside part of the function the derivative of x to the fifth power is 5x to the fourth power that process can help you to solve derivatives associated with the chain rule so when dealing with a chain rule you're dealing with composite functions so if you want to find the derivative of a function inside of another function like f of g of x it's equal to the derivative of the outside function so f prime and then the inside function stays the same that is g of x and then times the derivative of the inside function g prime of x so that's how you could find the derivative of a composite function when you have a function inside of another function so let's say we want to find the derivative of 4x cubed plus 7x raised to the fifth power in this case we need to start with the outer function that is the power rule so we're going to move the 5 to the front we're going to keep the inside function the same and then we're going to subtract the exponent by 1. next we're going to take the derivative of the inside function the derivative of 4x cube is 12x squared the derivative of 7x is 7. so that's the derivative of this function so you don't have to foil this five times you could just simply use the chain rule to get the answer now let's move on to our next example what is the derivative of tangent of sine x cubed go ahead and work on that example so first we're going to find the derivative of the outer function tangent and that's going to be secant squared now inside of tangent we have sine x cubed so we're going to have the same thing inside of secant squared so we're starting with the outer function and we're working our way in so now let's work our way in towards sine the derivative of sine is cosine and the angle of sine is x cubed so the angle of cosine will be x cubed and then we're going to work even further towards the inside part of the functions the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared now that's as far as we can go so this is the answer of this expression secant squared sine x cubed times cosine x cubed times 3x squared here's another example you could work on find the derivative of sine to the fourth power of cosine of tangent x squared now what i would recommend doing since we have an exponent here is rewriting the expression so basically what this means is that this whole thing is raised to the fourth power and it affects the way you're going to apply the chain rule because before you can differentiate the sine function you need to use the power rule on that exponent so let's move the 4 to the front so it's going to be 4 and then we're going to rewrite everything we see inside of the brackets highlighted in red now we're going to subtract the exponent by one and then we're going to differentiate the sine function so that's going to be cosine and then the angle of sine is everything we see here that's cosine of tangent x squared so now we're going to move inward towards cosine by the way it is the multiplication for all of these functions so it's times the derivative of cosine is negative sine and the angle of cosine is tangent x squared so we're going to rewrite that now let's work our way in towards tangent the derivative of tangent is secant squared and the angle is x squared finally we can find the derivative of x squared which is 2x and so this whole thing is our final answer now of course you can combine a few things you can combine the 4 and the 2x and the negative sign and you can put negative 8x in front but besides that there's nothing else you can do here so that's it for this problem now the next topic we need to talk about is implicit differentiation sometimes you'll have equations with two different variables like this one x and y and you want to find the derivative of y with respect to x so basically you want to determine the value of dydx how do you do that well what you do is you're going to differentiate both sides with respect to x now before we do that i want to talk about a few things when you differentiate x cubed with respect to x you're going to get 3x squared and technically you get times dx over dx which cancels to one but if you want to differentiate y cube with respect to x you're going to get three y squared but times d y d x note the difference here since these variables don't match up here these they do match up so this would be dx over dx which is pointless in writing so implicit when dealing with implicit differentiation problems every time you differentiate y with respect to x you need to add dydx now sometimes you'll be dealing with what is known as related rates instead of differentiating with respect to x you'll be differentiating with respect to t or time so if you differentiate x cubed with respect to time it's going to be 3x squared but times dx dt likewise if you differentiate y cube with respect to time it's going to be 3y squared times d y dt so just keep that in mind but when dealing with implicit differentiated i mean let me say that again when dealing with implicit differentiation we are differentiating with respect to x so the derivative of x to the fourth is simply going to be 4x cubed but the derivative of y to the fourth is going to be 4 y cubed but times d y over dx and this is what we need to solve for the derivative of 12 is zero so i'm going to take this term and move it to the other side so i'm going to have 4y cubed cube times dyd dydx and that's going to be equal to negative 4x cubed and then all we need to do is divide both sides by 4y cube and then the force will cancel and so we get d y over dx is equal to negative x cubed over y cubed so that's a quick and simple example of how to perform implicit differentiation for the sake of practice let's work on one more example let's say we have x cubed plus 4xy plus y squared is equal to 9. go ahead and calculate the value of d y over dx so we're going to differentiate this entire equation with respect to x the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared now notice that we have x and y so we need to use the product rule i'm going to say the first part the u part is 4x the v part is going to be y so the derivative of the first part 4x is just 4 times the second part which is just y plus the first part 4x times the derivative of the second part the derivative of y is going to be 1 times d y over dx because we're differentiating y with respect to x now the derivative of y squared is going to be 2y times d y over dx and the derivative of a constant is always zero so everything that does not have a dy over dx attached to it i'm going to move to the other side so i'm going to move these two terms across the equal sign so we're going to have 4x dy over dx plus 2y dy over dx and that's going to equal negative 3x squared minus 4y so because we have a common factor we can now factor out the dy over dx on the left side and that's going to leave us with 4x plus 2y which equals negative 3x minus 4y so now we can divide both sides by this 4x plus 2y so these two will cancel and thus we have our final answer d y over d x is equal to negative three x squared minus four y and we could factor out a two on the bottom but i'm not going to worry about that in this example so that's gonna be divided by four x plus two y so now you know how to find the derivative in or using implicit differentiation so far we talked about how we could find the derivative of a variable raised to a constant and that is by using the power rule x to the n the derivative of that is going to be n times x raised to the n minus 1. and we also talk about having or finding the derivative of a constant raised to a variable and that was a to the u times u prime times lna so we have a variable raised to a constant and a constant raised to a variable but what about finding the derivative of a variable raised to a variable how do we do that how do we find the derivative of x raised to the x well first let's make y equal to x raised to the x so if we could find the derivative of y then we know what the derivative of x to the x is that's step one step two is to take the natural log of both sides so ln y is equal to ln x raised to the x now a property of natural logs allows us to move the variable x to the front and so what we're going to have is ln y is equal to x ln x and now at this point we are going to differentiate both sides with respect to x so here's how you can express that in mathematical words now we know that the derivative of ln x is one over x so the derivative of l and y is going to be one over y now notice that we're differentiating y with respect to x so when you see that you need to add d y over dx this is basically implicit differentiation on the right side we need to use the product rule so we're going to differentiate the first part x which is 1 and leave the second part by itself and then we're going to leave the first part by itself and then differentiate the second part the derivative of ln x is one over x so what we have now is one over y times d y over dx and that's equal to ln x and then x times one over x you can cross out the x variables so it becomes plus one and now what we're going to do is we're going to multiply both sides by y so we can cross out the y variables here and so we're going to have d y d x is equal to y times you could say ln x plus one or you could say one plus l and x now recall at the beginning we set x raised to the x equal to y at this point we're going to substitute y with x raised to the x so the final answer is going to be x raised to the x times 1 plus ln x so that's how you could perform what is known as logarithmic differentiation that's how you could find the derivative of a variable raised to a variable so this is the answer so you could say that the derivative of x raised to the x in this example is x raised to the x times 1 plus ln x well that's basically it for this video we've covered a lot of topics and hopefully you found it to be helpful thanks for watching 

Transcript for: Introduction to Related Rates
now before we start this problem let's go over a few basic things associated with related rates particularly derivatives you need to be familiar with implicit differentiation for instance what is the derivative of y Cub with respect to X the derivative of y Cub with respect to X is 3 y^2 * dydx now let's say if we want to differentiate s to the 4th power but with respect to R the derivative of s to the 4th power is going to be 4S Cub but times DS over Dr R let's say if we want to differentiate x to the 5th power with respect to X this will be 5 x 4th time DX over DX which will cancel and we'll simply get 5x 4 now if we want to differentiate x to the 5th with respect to time it's going to be 5 x 4th * DX DT and with related rates that's what you're doing you're going to differentiate the equation with respect to time so let's say if we differentiate with respect to time y to the 7th power this is going to be 7 y 6 * dydt so when dealing with related rates you're going to have things like dydt dxdt and something with DT in it depending on what the variable is because you're dealing with uh units of time when you're dealing with rates a rate is basically how fast something changes with respect to time now let's focus on this problem if x^2 + y^2 = 25 and DX over DT is 7 find dydt when X is 3 now it's always good to make a list of what you have and what you need to find so we know the value of x x is three but we don't know the value of y now we have the value of dxct that tells you how fast the variable X is changing with respect to time so that's postive 7 if it's positive that means that X is increasing with respect to time at this instant our goal is to find dydt so let's calculate the value of y first using this equation so x^2 + y^2 is 25 let's replace x with 3 and let's solve for y 3^2 is 9 and 25 5 - 9 is 16 now we need to take the square root of both sides the square root of 16 is four now it can be positive4 or it can be ne4 so we have two possible answers so I'm going to put plus or minus 4 now how can we calculate dydt using this equation what do you think we need to do at this point we need to find the derivative with respect to time so we have to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time the derivative of x^2 with respect to T is going to be 2x * DX DT and for y^2 is going to be something similar it's going to be 2 y * dydt 25 is a con Conant and the derivative of a constant is zero now we can plug everything in into this equation and get the answer now because there's two possible answers for y let's try both let's try positive 4 for now so X is 3 DX DT is 7 so that part won't change Y is going to be four and now let's see what dydt is going to be 2 * 3 is 6 and and 6 * 7 that's 42 2 * 4 is 8 and now let's move the 42 to the other side of the equation so 8 dydt is equal to 42 and then let's divide both sides by 8 now 42 over 8 if we divide by 2 this becomes 21 / 4 so dy over DT is equal to 21 over 4 when Y is pos4 now I almost made one little mistake and when I move the 42 from the left to the right it should now be42 so this is -21 over 4 when Y is positive4 now let's see what's going to happen when y is4 so this time I'm going to solve for dydt so let's take this term move it to the other side so I have 2 y dydt on the left on the right -2X DX DT so now let's divide both sides by 2 y so dydt will equal the twos will cancel so it's going to Bex * DX DT / y so X is still pos3 DX CT is 7 and Y this time is -4 3 * 7 is 21 and -21 / -4 is POS 21 over4 so the magnitude is the same the only difference is the sign is different so when Y is pos4 dydt is - 21 over4 and when Y is-4 dydt is a POS 21 over4 let's try another problem if x^2 + y^2 = z^2 DX DT = 3 and dydt = 5 find dzdt when X is equal to 8 and Y is 15 so let's write down what we know so X is 8 Y is 15 and we don't have the value of Z Now DX DT so that's positive3 d ydt is 5 and our goal in this problem is to calculate dzdt so let's calculate Z first using this formula x^2 + y^2 = z^2 so 8^ 2 + 15^ 2 is equal to z^2 8 * 8 is 64 15 * 15 is 225 and 64 + 2 25 that's 289 now let's take the square root of both sides so the square root of 289 is 17 so Z is equal to 17 now just like before Z could be plus or minus 17 but we're going to choose just positive 17 just to keep things simple let's not worry about the -7 value so let's calculate dzdt when Z is pos7 so first we need to differentiate both sides of this equation with respect to time the derivative of x^2 is 2X and then times DX DT and for y^2 it's going to be 2 y * dydt and then Z ^2 2 Z * dzdt so notice that we can divide each term by two so basically we can get rid of the two and now plug in what you know and solve for the missing variable so X is 8 and dxdt is three Y is five and dydt actually Y is 15 and dydt is 5 Z is 17 so let's calculate dzdt 8 * 3 is 24 and 15 * 5 10 * 5 is 50 5 * 5 is 25 50 and 25 adds up to 75 24 + 75 that's 99 and that's equal to 17 * dzdt now let's divide both sides by 17 so dzdt is 99 over 17 when Z is positive 17 and so this is just a basic introduction into related rates it helps you to focus on the analytical part of solving problems now for other problems you need to design the equation yourself you have to figure out what equation applies to certain situations and it's best to draw a picture so I'm going to post some other videos on related rates and you could take a look at those if you need help in that area so that's it for this video and uh thanks again for watching 

Transcript for: dy/dx, d/dx, and dy/dt - Derivative Notations in Calculus
in this video i kind of want to discuss the difference between dydx and also d over dx because when dealing with derivatives typically you'll see these two things and you might be wondering what to do when you see them well let's say that y is equal to x cubed plus 4x what does it mean when you see dydx in a problem like this and sometimes you'll see this d of dx and then x cubed plus 4x squared so what's the difference well here's the way i like to think about it dydx kind of tell me what it is d over dx tells me what to do d over ds expresses a command it's basically saying hey find the derivative of whatever is inside of here with respect to x d y over dx tells you hey this is the derivative of some function in this case y the derivative of y with respect to x is 3x squared plus 8x and in this case this expression tells us to differentiate this expression which will be the same thing 3x squared plus 8x so hopefully that kind of help you to see the difference between the two so d over dx tells you what to do it tells you to differentiate the function inside the brackets with respect to x d y d x simply makes a statement it tells you that the derivative of y with respect to x is equal to whatever you see here now let's see if we can put this together d y over dx is equivalent to saying take the derivative of y with respect to x and we could replace y with this expression y is x cubed plus 4x squared using the power rule this is going to give us 3x squared plus 8x which as we can see that's equal to dy over dx so hopefully that connected everything together when you see these two things now if we want to find the derivative of x cubed with respect to x we know it's 3x squared but what if we want to find the derivative of let's say y cubed with respect to x what's the answer well using the power rule it's going to be 3y squared but notice that these variables do not match so we're going to have something else it's going to be 3y squared times dy over dx typically you'll see problems like this when dealing with something called implicit differentiation now what if we want to differentiate let's say x to the fifth power with respect to some variable s this would be 5x to the fourth times dx ds so that's the derivative of x with respect to s now sometimes when dealing with related rates problems you'll see d over dt so you're differentiating with respect to time so you could differentiate with respect to many things you could differentiate with respect to x with respect to some other variable s or with respect to t so let's say if we want to differentiate x to the fourth power plus y cubed with respect to time it's going to be 4x cubed plus 3y squared actually let's take that back it's 4x cubed times dx dt and then plus 3y squared times dydt so dx dt is the derivative of x with respect to time d y dt is the derivative of y with respect to time so i don't know if you've covered related rates yet but you'll see that a lot when dealing with that topic okay time for a pop quiz let's see if you been paying attention let's say that r is a function of x and t and that r is equal to x cubed plus t to the fifth power go ahead and find d r over d y feel free to pause the video if you want to try this problem so what we're doing is we're going to take the derivative of r with respect to y so that's what we're going to do in order to find this thing and so we're going to replace r with what it equals so right now think about what this is telling us to do this is saying differentiate this expression with respect to y the derivative of x cubed with respect to y is 3x squared times d dx over d y and the derivative of t to the fifth power with respect to y is five t to the fourth power times dt over d y so that's our answer so that's we could say that d r over d y is equal to three x squared d x over d y plus five t to the fourth times d dt over d y so this tells us what to do this tells us what the answer is so hopefully you can see the difference between these two expressions and that's basically it for this video i'm out hopefully you found it to be helpful thanks again for watching 

Transcript for: Related Rate Problems - The Cube - Volume, Surface Area & Diagonal Length
the edges of a cube are increasing at a rate of 10 meters per hour how fast is the volume of the cube changing when the side lamps are 5 meters well let's draw a picture first i know my drawings are not that great but bear with me for one moment so we have this cube and the side length of the cube are all the same let's call it x now let's make a list of what we know in this problem the edges of the cube that is x they're increasing at a rate of 10 meters per hour so dx dt is 10 meters per hour how fast is the volume of the cube changing so we're looking for dv dt when the side lengths are five so when x is five meters so how can we calculate dv dt first we need to write an equation that relates the volume of the cube to x now the volume of a rectangular prism is the length times the width times the height in this case the length of the cube is x the width is x and the height is x so x times x times x or one plus one plus one is three so the volume is x cubed so now that we've related v to x we could differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time so the derivative of v is going to be 1 times dv dt and the derivative of x cubed using the power rule is 3x squared times dx dt so that's the formula that we need to use right now but let's get rid of some stuff so we can see that x is 5 and dx dt is 10 meters per hour now let's do the math 5 squared is 25 and 3 times 25 is 75 and 75 times 10 is 750. so dv dt is equal to 750. now what are the units for dv dt so notice that we have meters squared times meters per hour meters squared times meters that's going to be cubic meters so it's cubic meters per hour and since the edges of the cube are increasing dv dt is increasing so it's equal to a positive number and that's it for part a of this problem so that's how you can calculate the rate at which the volume of a cube is changing now let's move on to part b how fast is the surface area of the cube changing when the edge lamps are eight so x is no longer five but it's eight meters so let's change that number so how can we find the answer to this question how can we determine the rate at which the surface area is changing how can we find ds80t so first we need to come up with an equation that relates the surface area of a cube to x the surface area is going to be the area of all six sides so notice that we have a side in the front one in the back so that's two sides here's the one on the left and here's the one on the right so that's four sides and then we have the bottom face of the cube and the top face of the cube so there's six faces now the area of each face the area of a square is the length times the width or simply x squared so the surface area of the q because there's six faces all of which are going to be the same it's going to be 6 times x squared because you have to add up the area of each face each of which is x squared now let's find the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to t so the derivative of s a is going to be 1 times d s a dt and then for the right side we need to rewrite the constant based on the constant multiple rule and then differentiate x squared based on the power rule which is going to be 2x to the first power times dx dt so 6 times 2 is 12 and then we can replace x with 8. well let's put 8 meters so we can pay attention to the units and then dx dt that's 10 meters per hour so what's 12 times 8 10 times 8 is 80 2 times 8 is 16 so 80 plus 16 is 96 and so 12 times 8 is 96 and then 96 times 10 is 960. so dsa dt is going to be 960. now what are the units so we have meters times meters which is going to be square meters and for dt it's going to be in hours and it makes sense because the volume is usually in cubic meters area is going to be in square meters which we do have here so that's the value of ds80t it's 960 square meters per hour so that's it for part b now let's move on to part c how fast is the length of the diagonal in the cube changing when the edge lengths are 12. so let's replace this number with 12 meters so first let's draw the diagonal that we're focused on so it's the distance between these two points and i'm going to draw it in basically a red color so let's call it z diagonal z so we're looking for how fast z is changing so we need to calculate dz dt now how can we come up with an equation that relates the diagonal z to x now first we need to draw another diagonal which is going to be at the bottom face of the cube let's call that diagonal l notice that it forms a right triangle so if you want to redraw it looks like this so this is x x l what is the relationship between x and l well according to the pythagorean theorem which is uh c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared c being the hypotenuse l is the hypotenuse in this example and a and b are x so l squared is basically x squared plus x squared now let's focus on another triangle which i'm going to highlight in blue and that is this triangle here notice that it forms another right triangle so i'm going to redraw it and for that triangle we have l at the bottom x and z this time z is the hypotenuse so this is z squared is equal to x squared plus l squared and now we can replace l squared with x squared plus x squared so therefore z squared is going to be x squared plus x squared plus x squared so 1 plus 1 plus 1 is 3 so z squared is equal to 3 times x squared and so this is the equation that we need to relate z and x now let's go ahead and find the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to t so the derivative of z squared is going to be 2z times dz dt and the derivative of 3x squared is going to be 3 times 2x times dx dt so now we can calculate dz dt but first let's divide both sides by 2 just to get rid of that too now we need to find z as well because we don't have that so let's use this equation to get z so we know that z squared is equal to three times x squared and in this example x is 12. so i recommend taking the square root of both sides at this point so z is going to be the square root of 3 times the square root of 12 squared the square root of 12 squared is the square root of 144 which is 12. so z is basically 12 times the square root of 3 which i'm going to write over here now let's plug in everything so this is z 12 square root 3 we need to solve for dz dt and then we have 3 times x where x is 12 and then dx dt that's still 10. so if we divide both sides by 12 we can get rid of this and then on the right side we have 3 times 10 which is 30. so the square root of 3 times dz dt that's equal to 30. now let's divide by the square root of three so dz dt is equal to 30 divided by the square root of three and then we need to rationalize the fraction so let's multiply the top and the bottom by the square root of three the square root of three times the square root of three is the square root of nine which is three and thirty divided by 3 is 10. so dz dt is 10 square root 3 and the units will be the same as dx of t so it's going to be meters per hour because x is a unit of length just as z is a unit of left so that's the final answer for d dt you 

Transcript for: Related Rates - Inflated Balloon & Melting Snowball Problem - Surface Area & Volume
in this video we're going to go over related rate problems dealing with circles spheres the inflated balloon and the melting snowball problem so let's start with this one the radius of a circle is increasing at five centimeters per minute how fast is the circumference of the circle changing when the radius is ten so let's write down what we know so r the radius is equal to ten centimeters and the rate at which the radius of the circle is changing that's going to be dr dt that's positive 5 centimeters per minute it's positive because the radius is increasing our goal in part a is to find the rate at which the circumference is changing so looking for dc dt now the first thing we need to do is come up with an equation that has r dr dt dc dt so what equation can you come up with the circumference of a circle is c is equal to 2 pi r now we need to get dc dt so let's differentiate this equation with respect to time the derivative of c is one but times d c d t two pi is a constant so we could just rewrite that based on the constant multiple rule the derivative of r is 1 but times d r dt so we have everything that we need we really don't need r in this example dr dt is 5 and so dc dt is going to be 2 pi times 5 so it's going to be 10 pi centimeters per minute that's the rate at which the circumference is changing and because it's positive the circumference of the circle is increasing now let's move on to part b how fast is the area of the circle changing when the radius is eight centimeters so r is now eight it's no longer ten so let's get rid of this number but dr dt is still five centimeters per minute and our goal is to calculate d80t the rate at which the area of the circle is changing so the equation that connects a and r is the area of a circle the area of a circle is pi r squared so now let's differentiate this equation with respect to time the derivative of a is one but times d a dt pi is a constant so let's rewrite that the derivative of r squared is two r but times d r dt so we have two pi times the radius which is currently eight centimeters and then dr dt that's five centimeters per minute so now let's calculate d80t two times five is 10 and 10 times 8 is 80 times pi so this is going to be 80 pi now for the units we have centimeters times centimeters so that's square centimeters and we have minutes on the bottom so dt is going to be square centimeters per minute so this is the answer area is always in square units and dt is always going to have some unit of time seconds minutes hours whatever you see here number two air is pumped into a spherical balloon at a rate of 450 cubic centimeters per minute how fast is the radius of the balloon changing when r is 10 so once again let's make a list of what we know so the radius is 10 centimeters and the rate at which air is being pumped into the balloon we have 450 cubic centimeters per minute now what do you think that represents now centimeters is basically a unit of length it could be radius it could be height square centimeters would be a unit of area but cubic meters represents a volume so this quantity is the rate at which the volume of the balloon is changing so that's dv dt and because air is being pumped into the balloon the balloon is expanding so the volume is increasing so it has to be positive 450 and not negative 450. how fast is the radius of the balloon changing so we need to calculate dr dt so what equation will connect the radius with the volume now we're dealing with a spherical balloon or a sphere and the volume of a sphere is four thirds pi r cubed now let's take the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to time the derivative of v is one but times dv dt four thirds pi is a constant so let's rewrite that the derivative of r cubed is three r squared and then times d r dt so on the right side we can cancel a three so we don't have to worry about that and we're looking to calculate dv dt actually no we have dv dt i take that back we need to calculate the rdt dv dt is 450 and that's equal to 4 pi times r squared and r squared is r is 10 so if we square that that's going to be a hundred so on the right we have 10 squared which is a hundred times four pi so that's 400 pi so 450 is equal to 400 pi times dr dt so let's divide both sides by 400 pi so now we need to simplify this expression we can cancel a zero 450 over 400 is the same as 45 over 40. now 45 is basically 9 times 5 and 40 is eight times five so we can cancel a five therefore the final answer is going to be nine over eight pi so let me just rewrite that here because i am running out of space dr dt is equal to positive 9 over 8 pi centimeters per minute that's the answer number three the surface area of a spherical melting snowball is decreasing at a rate of two square centimeters per minute find a rate at which the diameter is changing when the radius of the snowball is five centimeters so we have r the radius is five and we have the rate at which the surface area is changing so that's going to be dsa dt and it's decreasing at 2 square centimeters per minute so that's going to be negative 2cm squared per minute our goal is to find the rate at which the diameter is changing so we need to find dd dt where capital d will use that to represent the diameter the diameter is always going to be twice the radius so if r is 5 the diameter has to be 10 centimeters somehow we need to relate the surface area of the sphere to the diameter how can we do so the surface area of a sphere is equal to 4 pi r squared and we know that d is equal to 2r so solving for r dividing both sides by 2 we can say that d divided by 2 is equal to r so now let's replace r with d over 2. so this is going to be d squared over four now we can cancel the four so we're left with the surface area is pi times d squared so now we could differentiate this equation with respect to time so we're going to have on the left dsa dt and that's equal to pi now the derivative of d squared is 2d times d dt so we have dsa dt that's negative 2 and we have the value of d which is 10 centimeters and so let's calculate the rate at which the diameter is changing so first let's get rid of some stuff now if we divide both sides by 2 these will be canceled so what we now have is negative 1 is equal to 10 pi times d dt so dividing both sides by 10 pi we're going to get our final answer so the rate at which the diameter is changing is negative 1 over 10 pi with the units centimeters per minute and that's it for this problem so that's it for this whole video hopefully it gave you a good idea of how to solve basic related rates problems you 

Transcript for: Related Rates - Gravel Dumped Into Conical Tank Problem
let's work on this particular related rates problem gravel falls off a conveyor belt onto a conical pile at a rate of 50 cubic feet per minute the diameter of the base of the cone is always five times the height of the power how fast is the height of the pile increasing when the pile is 12 feet high so let's draw a picture first so let's say this is the conveyor belt and we have some sand that's basically fallen off and it turns into a pow which forms the shape of a cone we need to determine how fast the height of this cone is changing so that's just a picture just to give you a visual illustration of what's happening here but let's focus on the shape of a cone so we have a circular base and it looks like this and so here we have the height of the cone let's call that h and this part is the radius of the cone and the diameter is going to be twice the length of the radius so we can say that d is equal to 2r now let's make a list of what we know what does the 50 cubic feet per minute represents any time you see cubic feet cubic meters cubic something it represents volume so this tells us the rate at which the volume is changing and so that is the quantity for dv dt it's 50 cubic feet per minute now we're told that the diameter of the base of the cone is always five times the height of the pile so the diameter which is d is always equal to 5 times h and d is 2r so we can say that 2r is equal to 5 times h now our goal in this problem is to determine the rate at which the height of the pile is changing when the pile is 12 feet high so we know that h is 12 and the rate at which the height is changing is represented by dhdt and that's what we're looking for in this problem so how can we calculate dhdt well first we need to relate the height to the volume because we have dv dt and we need to calculate dht the volume of a cone is represented by this equation it's 1 3 pi r squared times the height now if we try to differentiate this equation with respect to time we're going to have dr dt and the hdt so we're going to have two missing variables which we don't want to be in that situation therefore we need to get rid of this r and replace it with h fortunately we have an equation that relates r with h so solving for r let's divide both sides by 2 in that equation so r is equal to 5 over 2 times h so now let's replace r with 5 over 2 times h 5 squared is 25 2 squared is 4 and then we'll have h squared times h which is h cubed now let's go ahead and differentiate both sides with respect to time and i'm running out of space so let's just get rid of some stuff i'm always running out of space the derivative of v is going to be 1 times dv dt and then we can rewrite the constants so that's going to be 25 pi and here we have 3 times 4 which is 12. so 25 pi over 12 and the derivative of h cube is going to be 3 h squared times dh dt so now let's plug in everything that we have and let's calculate dht so dv dt that's 50 and h is 12 so this is going to be 12 squared and then dhdt so we could at least cancel a 12. that's good and so we have 50 is equal to 25 pi times 3 times 12 which is 36. now i'm going to divide both sides by 25 first because it goes nicely into 50. 50 divided by 25 is 2. so we have 2 is equal to 36 pi times dhdt now if we divide both sides by 36 pi we have dh dt is equal to 2 over 36 pi and 36 you can write it as 18 times 2. so we could cancel a 2. 2 divided by 2 is 1. so dhdt is going to be 1 over 18 pi with the units feet per minute and so that's the answer now let's work on another problem water is leaking out of an inverted conical tank at a rate of 7 500 cubic centimeters per minute the height of the tank is eight meters and it has a diameter of six meters at the top let's draw a picture so this is going to be the radius of the circle and then this is the diameter and here we have the height of the cone if the water level is falling at a rate of 15 centimeters per minute when the height of the water is 0.25 meters what is the rate at which water is flowing into the tank so we have water going into the tank and some of it is leaking out of the tank so we need to take into consideration those two things now the height of the cone or the height of the tank that's eight meters and we're told that the diameter is 6 meters at the top so d is 6 meters now the height of the water we're told is 0.25 meters so how can we find the rate at which water is flowing into the tank now we need to realize that the difference between let me start over the difference between the rate at which water is flowing into the tank minus the rate at which water is flowing out of the tank that's going to equal the net volume flow rate now this is what we need to solve for that's the rate at which water is flowing into the tank we have the rate at which it is leaking out of the tank that's 7 500 cubic centimeters per minute but how can we calculate this term because that's the part that we're missing so that's the net rate at which the volume of water inside the cone is changing we need to use this equation to calculate it the volume of a cone one third pi r cubed i mean pi r squared times h now let's write down what we know so we know the height of water in the cone is 0.25 meters we also know the rate at which the water level is falling and that's dhdt because the height is changing and because the height is decreasing it's going to be negative 15 centimeters per minute now notice that we have different units we have centimeters and we have meters now it's best to convert meters into centimeters because i really don't want to convert cubic centimeters into meters that's going to take more time so let's start with 0.25 meters one meter is equal to 100 centimeters so the unit meters will cancel 0.25 times 100 is 25 so h is 25 centimeters now notice that we don't have dr dt so we can't differentiate this function in this form because we'll have dv dt which we need to calculate we have the htt but we don't have drdt so we need to replace r with h how can we do that let's write a ratio between the height of the tank and the diameter so the height of the tank is eight meters and the diameter is six so if we cross multiply we're gonna have eight d is equal to six h and we know the diameter is twice the radius so if we replace d with 2r we're going to have 8 times 2 which is 16 so 16r is equal to 6h now we need to solve for r so we got to divide both sides by 16. so r is going to be 6h over 16. and if you divide both numbers by 2 we can say that r is 3h over 8. so let's replace r with three over eight times h three squared is 9 8 squared is 64. and then we have h squared times h which is h cubed one third of 9 is 3. so this is going to be 3 pi over 64 times h cubed so now in this form we could differentiate both sides with respect to t the derivative of v with respect to t that's going to be dv dt and then we're going to have the constant 3 pi over 64. and the derivative of h cube using the power rule is 3h squared and then times dhdt now it's important to understand that this is the net dv dt basically this value right here it tells us the net rate at which the volume of the water inside the cone is changing it's the difference between a rate of water flowing in and the rate of water flowing out so let's plug in what we know h is 25 and dh dt that's negative 15. now let's plug these numbers into the calculator so 3 pi times 3 times 25 squared times negative 15 divided by 64. so as a decimal dv dt the net value that's going to be negative 4142 and rounded to nearest whole number and it has the units cubic centimeters per minute keep in mind dhet is centimeters per minute and h is in centimeters but it's squared so now let's calculate this term so let's replace this value with negative 4142 and then we have dv dt the rate of water flowing in and the amount of water that's flowing out or the rate at which the volume of water is flowing out that's 7 500 so what we need to do is add 7 500 to both sides of the equation and so it's going to be negative 4142 plus 7 500. and so the final answer is 3358 so dv dt the rate at which water is flowing into the tank that's 3358 cubic centimeters per minute and the reason why it's positive is because this quantity will increase the volume of water whereas this quantity decreases the volume of water in the tank you 

Transcript for: Related Rates - Area of a Triangle
in this tutorial we're going to focus on related rate problems as it relates to triangles so let's start with this one the base of a right triangle is increasing at 3 centimeters per minute while the height of the triangle is increasing at a rate of 5 centimeters per minute how fast is the area of the triangle changing when the base and height are 8 centimeters and 10 centimeters long respectively so let's draw a picture so here we have a right triangle and this is the base of the right triangle this is the height the area of the right triangle is simply one half base times height now let's write down what we know so we know the base is eight centimeters and the height is 10 centimeters we also know the rate at which the base and the height are changing the base is increasing at three centimeters per minute and the height it's increasing at a rate of five centimeters per minute so with this information how can we determine how fast the area of the triangle is changing so basically what is da dt what's the value that corresponds to it now what we need to do is we need to differentiate this equation with respect to time so the derivative of a is one but times d a dt now how can we differentiate one half base times height the base and the height they're changing they don't have a fixed length and so they're variables not constants therefore we need to use the product rule now just recall let's say if you wish to differentiate f times g it's going to be the derivative of the first times the second plus the first part times the derivative of the second part so just keep that in mind let's say that f is one half times the base and g is going to be the height so f prime the derivative of the first part the derivative of one half b is one half times one and then the derivative of b is just one times db dt if we're differentiating with respect to time and then it's going to be times second part plus the first part times the derivative of the second part the derivative of h is 1 times dhdt so now we have everything that we need to calculate d80t so db dt that's 3 centimeters per minute and h is 10 and then b is 8 and then dhdt is 5. so ten times a half is five five times three is fifteen one half of eight is four four times five is twenty and then fifteen plus 20 is 35. now let's focus on the units so let me just get rid of this real quick what are the units for d80t so what's the unit for area we're dealing with centimeters but area is always in square units so this is going to be 35 square centimeters and for time the time is in minutes so it's going to be 35 square centimeters per minute if you look at db dt the unit was centimeters per minute and then for h it's going to be times centimeters and that will give you square centimeters per minute so there's different ways in which you can employ to find the unit for your final answer so that's it 35 square centimeters per minute now let's work on another problem a triangle has two sides of fixed length which are five meters and eight meters long the angle between the two sides is increasing at a rate of point 15 radians per minute how fast is the area of the triangle changing when the angle between the two sides is pi over three so let's draw a picture first now we don't have a right triangle so we're going to draw simply a generic triangle this is going to be angle a b and c across angle a we have side a and then across angle b is side b and then here we have side c so anytime you have a generic triangle this is what you want to draw and for this particular triangle we have this formula the area is equal to one half a b sine of angle c so all of the capital letters represents angles and the lowercase letters represents sides now let's make a list of what we know so we have two sides of fixed length five meters and eight meters let's call that a and b so we're gonna say a is five meters b is eight meters now we also know the angle between the two sides you can call it theta if you want or you can call it angle c let's call it angle c an angle c which is between those two side lamps a and b it's pi over three now we also have the rate at which the angle is changing and the angle between the two sides which is dc dt that's changing at a rate of point 15 radians per minute all we need to do now is calculate how fast the area of the triangle is changing now notice that we don't have d a d t and d b d t why is that not given to us why don't we have that and the reason is that a and b are not variables in this problem rather they're constants and the key expression that we need to focus on is those sides are of a fixed length because a and b do not change dadt is zero and db dt is zero so we don't have to worry about differentiating a and b we'll have to treat it as variables simply as constants and that's gonna make this problem a lot easier so let's go ahead and differentiate this equation with respect to time so the derivative of a is going to be d80t and then this is going to equal the constant based on the constant multiple rules so we could just rewrite that one half a b and then c is the variable so the derivative of sine c the derivative of sine is cosine so we're going to have cosine of angle c and then according to the chain rule you need to differentiate the inside function of sine so the derivative of c is one times dc dt now let's plug in what we know so a is five b is eight and then we have cosine of c or cosine of pi over three times dc dt which is point fifteen now eight times five is forty and half of forty is twenty cosine pi over three is one half so half of twenty is ten and ten times point fifteen is 1.5 now what are the units so we know this is going to be square units and the lengths are in meters so this is going to be square meters and then dt that's a unit of time we're dealing with minutes so it's square meters per minute so that's how fast the area is changing it's increasing by 1.5 square meters every minute so that means that in two minutes it's going to increase by three square meters in 10 minutes if we multiply by 10 minutes the unit minutes will cancel and so in 10 minutes it will increase by 15 square meters and that's basically it for this video so now you know how to find the rate at which the area is changing for a right triangle or just any regular triangle thanks for watching you 

Transcript for: Related Rates - The Ladder Problem
number one a 17-foot ladder is leaning against a building the foot of the ladder is eight feet from the base of the building and it's sliding away from the building at three feet per second how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall of the building well let's find out so let's start with the picture so let's say that's the building this is the ground and let's say this is the ladder now let's call this x y and let's say the length of the ladder is z now let's write down what we know so we have a 17 foot ladder therefore z is 17. the foot of the ladder is 8 feet from the base so that's the value of x and we don't know the value of y now we know that the ladder is sliding away from the building that is it's sliding in this direction at 3 feet per second so every second x is going to change by three feet so that's dx dt that's the rate at which x is changing so let's write that here so dx dt is three feet per second now we don't have the value for dydt but in part a that's what we're looking for how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall so as the ladder slides to the right it's also sliding down the wall and so y is changing as well notice that y is decreasing while x is increasing because x is increasing dx dt is going to be positive and because y is decreasing we should expect a negative answer for d y d t so let's go ahead and calculate d y d t so we need an equation that relates x y and z so notice that we have a right triangle and according to the pythagorean theorem c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared now c is the hypotenuse so c matches with z and we can say a is x b is y so z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared now before we could differentiate both sides with respect to time we need to calculate the value of y so z is 17 x is eight what is y 17 squared that's 289 8 times 8 is 64. 289 minus 64 is 225 and now we need to take the square root of both sides the square root of 225 is 15. so now that we have the value of y we should differentiate this equation with respect to time so the derivative of z squared is what is it 2z times dz dt now notice that z is not a variable but a constant z cannot change so therefore dz dt is zero so anytime you find the derivative of a constant it's going to be zero so this is going to be zero it's equal to two x times dx dt and the derivative of y squared will be two y times d y dt so we could divide everything by two zero divided by two is zero so we can get rid of this x is eight dx dt is three y is 15 and we need to calculate dy dt now 8 times 3 is 24 so let's move that to this side on the left side is going to be negative 24 and that's equal to 15 times d y dt so if we divide both sides by 15 we can see that d y dt is negative 24 over 15. but we can reduce that so let me just reduce it somewhere on the left side 24 is eight times three fifteen is five times three so we could cancel with three so therefore d y dt is negative eight over five and that's it for part a now let's move on to part b how fast is the area formed by the ladder changing at this instant so what is the area of a right triangle the area of a right triangle is one half base times height in this problem we can see that the base is x and the height is y now we have dx dt and dy dt so in this form we can go ahead and differentiate this equation with respect to time the derivative of a is going to be d a dt which is what we're looking for and then we need to use the product rule so let's say if we have f times g it's going to be the derivative of the first part times the second plus the first part times the derivative of the second so let's say the first part f we're going to say it's one half x and the second part g is y so f prime the derivative of one half times x is going to be one half times the derivative of x according to the constant multiple rule the derivative of x is one but times dx dt and then we need to multiply by the second part which is g and g is y and then plus the first part which is not going to change so that's one half x times the derivative of the second part which is g prime the derivative of y is one times d y dt now all we need to do is plug in the information that we have so this is going to be one half times dx dt which is 3 and then d y dt i mean not d y dt but y that's 15 and then plus one half times x which is eight and d y dt is negative eight over five and i forgot to write the units for dydt so let's talk about that so what's the units for y x and y have the units feet and then the unit for time is going to be seconds so dy dt is feet per second now let's go back to this problem so we have 3 times 15 which is 45 and half of that that's going to be 45 over 2. half of eight is four and four times negative eight that's going to be negative 32 so this is negative 32 over five so we need to combine these two fractions and so we have to get common denominators the common denominator between 2 and 5 is going to be 10 so we need to multiply the fraction on the right by 2 over 2 and the one on the left by 5 over 5. so what's 45 times 5 40 times 5 is 200 5 times 5 is 25 so this is going to be 225 over 10. 32 times 2 is 64. and if we subtract 225 by 64 that will give us 161. so da over dt is going to be 161 over 10 and the units is going to be square feet because we're dealing with area per second so this is the answer for part b now let's move on to part c find the rate at which the angle between the ladder and the ground is changing at this instant so where's the angle between the ladder and the ground so here is the ladder here's the ground therefore the angle between that is right here which we'll call theta now we need to relate theta to x y or z and we can use any of the three trig functions sine cosine or tangent however one of them i would not recommend using since it involves a lot of unnecessary work now let's review sohcahtoa hopefully you remember the principles taught and trig so let's start with so this tells us that sine theta is equal to the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse opposite to theta is y and the hypotenuse which is across the box that's z that's the longest side so sine theta is y divided by z now k tells us that cosine theta is equal to the adjacent side adjacent to theta is right next to it that's x divided by the hypotenuse z and toa tangent theta is equal to the opposite side y divided by the adjacent side x now keep this in mind x and y are variables because they're changing z is a constant now for sine you have a variable and a constant you could simply use the power rule to differentiate that and the same is true for cosine you have a variable and a constant for tangent you have two variables and so you need to use the quotient rule if you're going to use tangent theta and let's avoid the quotient rule so let's not use tangent theta i'm going to use sine theta so sine theta is equal to the opposite side of theta divided by the hypotenuse so i'm going to rewrite y over z as 1 over z times y so you can see what we have is a constant times the variable now let's differentiate both sides with respect to time so the derivative of sine theta is cosine theta and then according to the chain rule we need to differentiate the inside function theta the derivative of theta is one times d theta over dt now let's use the constant multiple rule so the derivative of a constant times y is going to be the constant times the derivative of y which is one times d y dt now what is cosine theta if you recall we said that cosine theta is equal to the adjacent side which is x over the hypotenuse c and we have x x is 8 and z is seventeen so therefore cosine theta is eight over seventeen our goal is to calculate the rate at which the angle is changing so we need to calculate d theta dt z we have that it's 17 and d y dt is negative eight over five so now let's multiply both sides by 17 over eight if we do so notice that the eights on the left cancel and on the right will cancel and at the same time the 17s will cancel on both sides so just by doing that simple move we have the answer so the only thing that's left over is d theta dt and as we can see it's equal to negative one over five and that's it so that's the answer for part c d theta dt is negative one over five and let's talk about the units the unit for d theta d t so the angle is in radians and the time is in seconds and that concludes this lesson so that's it for this video thanks for watching you 

Transcript for: Related Rates - Distance Problems - Application of Derivatives
in this video we're going to work on some related rates problems associated with distance let's start with this one a particle moves along the curve y equals x squared plus 2. the x-coordinate increases at a rate of 4 centimeters per second how fast is the distance between a point and the origin changing when x is two so let's start with a picture let's graph the function so x squared is basically a parabola and it's been shifted up two units so it looks like this that's a generic shape let me draw in red now let's say at this point x is equal to one let's call that point p and here is the origin so we need to find out how fast the distance between the origin and point p is changing so let's make a right triangle so this is going to be x y and the distance between point p and the origin let's call it z so we need to determine how fast z is changing so our goal in this problem is to calculate dz dt now let's make a list of what we know so we know that x is equal to one we don't know the value of y and we currently do not know the value of z now all of these are variables x y and z change none of them are fixed or constants now we have dx dt that's the rate at which the x coordinate is changing and that's four centimeters per second we don't have dy dt nor do we have dz dt but dz dt is what we're looking for that's the goal of this problem so let's put a question mark here so how can we calculate dz dt what do we need to do in this problem well let's find out the missing pieces first let's start with why how can we calculate y now we're given this equation y is equal to x squared plus two and we have x so let's replace x with one one squared is one and one plus two is three so y is equal to three now using that same equation we can calculate d y dt so let's differentiate this function with respect to time the derivative of y is going to be 1 times d y dt the derivative of x squared is going to be 2x times dx dt and 2 is a constant the derivative of a constant will be 0. so x is one dx dt is four two times four is eight so dydt is eight so now we need to calculate z and dz dt so we have this right triangle that we can use so based on the pythagorean theorem we know that c squared is equal to a squared plus a b squared and the hypotenuse is z so z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared first let's use this formula to calculate z so x is one y is three so one squared plus three squared that's one plus nine which is ten so z squared is equal to 10. if z squared is 10 then all we need to do is take the square root of both sides to calculate z so z is equal to the square root of 10. so now that we have z we could determine dz dt so let's start with this equation and let's differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time the derivative of z squared is 2z times dz dt and the derivative of x squared is going to be 2x dx dt and for y squared it's going to be 2y dy dt now let's divide everything by 2 so we can get rid of these and then plug everything in and solve for dz dt so z is the square root of 10 dz dt is what we're looking for x in this problem is one dx dt is four y is three d y dt is eight so 3 times 8 is 24 and 4 plus 24 is 28 so now we need to divide both sides by the square root of 10. so dz dt is equal to 28 divided by the square root of 10. now let's go ahead and rationalize this problem so let's multiply the top and the bottom by the square root of 10. so this is going to be 28 square root 10 divided by 10. now let's divide the top and the bottom by 2. half of 28 is 14 half of 10 is 5. so dz dt is 14 square root 10 over 5 and the unit will be the same as c x dt which is centimeters per second so that's the rate at which the distance between the point and the origin is changing when x is equal to one number two two cars begin moving from the same starting point at noon one travels east at 60 miles per hour and the other travels north at 80 miles per hour how fast is the distance between the two cars changing at three o'clock so let's draw a picture so the first car let's say this is the starting point travels east the second car travels north and the distance between them at some time later is going to be represented by that mark or that line so let's say x is the distance that the first car travels east y is the distance that the second car travels north and the distance between the two cars at three o'clock let's call that z now we have the rate at which x is changing the first car is traveling east at 60 miles per hour so that's dx dt now the second car is traveling north at 80 miles per hour so that's dy dc we need to find out how fast the z is changing the distance between the two cars so our goal is to calculate dz dt now what is x and what is y and z as well now the cars they begin traveling at noon that's at 12 o'clock and the current time is 3 o'clock so that means that 3 hours has passed so if the first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour how many miles did it travel in three hours so every hour it's doing 60 miles so in three hours it's going to do 60 times 3 or 180 miles now for the second car it's going at 80 miles every hour so in three hours eighty times three it's going to do 240 miles in distance now that we have x and y we can easily calculate z using the pythagorean theorem z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared now x is 180 and y is 240. so let's get a calculator for this square that's 32 400 and 240 squared is 57 600 so if we add those two numbers this will give us ninety thousand and that's equal to z squared so what is the square root of ninety thousand can we do that without a calculator ninety thousand is basically nine times ten thousand and the square root of nine is three the square root of ten thousand is a hundred so z is going to be three hundred so now that we have z we can calculate dz dt so it's going to be 2z well first we need to differentiate both sides with respect to time if we do so we're going to get 2z dz dt and that's equal to 2x dx dt plus 2y dy dt so dividing everything by two we're gonna have this equation left over so z is 300 we need to calculate dz dt x is 180 times dx dt which is 60 y is 240 times dy dt which is 80. so 180 times 60 that's 10 hundred and then two forty times eighty that's nineteen thousand two hundred and once again i am running out of space so now we have 300 times dz dt and if we add 19 200 plus thousand eight hundred that's equal to thirty thousand so now let's divide both sides by three hundred so we could cancel two zeros and three divided by three is one so we're going to have a one with two zeros left over so dz dt is a hundred and it has the same units as dxct and dydt which is miles per hour now it turns out that there's a simpler way in which you can get the same answer without drawing any pictures and just as z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared for this particular type of problem it turns out that dz over dt squared is equal to dx over dt squared plus dy over dt squared so dx dt that's 60 so we have 60 squared dy dt is 80 and 60 squared 60 times 60 that is 3600 and 80 squared is 6400 i put 64 000. 3600 plus 6400 is 10 000. so that's equal to dz dt squared which means we need to take the square root of both sides and we know the square root of ten thousand is a hundred so that's another way a much simpler way in which you can get the same answer to z to t number three at 2 pm ship b is 160 kilometers east of ship a so let's draw a picture so these are the two ships and b is east of a so b is to the right of a and the distance between these two points is 160 kilometers so this is the situation at 2pm now ship a is sailing south at 12 kilometers per hour ship b is selling north at 18 kilometers per hour how fast is the distance between the two ships changing at six pm so that is four hours later so what is the situation at four hours later or at six pm so the horizontal distance will still be the same now b has moved 18 kilometers per hour times four because the difference between 2 pm and 6 pm is 4 hours so 18 times 4 is 72 so b has traveled 72 kilometers north and a has traveled let's see 12 kilometers per hour so for four hours that's going to be 48 kilometers and then if we add 72 and 48 that's 120 so we can redraw this picture like this so the horizontal distance is still 160 but the vertical distance is now 120 and that is not drawn to scale so this is x and this is y now z is the distance between ships a and b so b is over here at this instant and this is a so our goal is to calculate dz dt now what's dx dt and what is d y dt notice that x does not change at two o'clock x was 160 and at six o'clock x is still 160. so therefore dx dt is zero the change in x with respect to time is zero now what about d y dt how can we determine d y dt so this is the rate at which y is changing with respect to time so notice that at 2 pm y is 0 because a and b they were horizontally apart from each other there was no vertical distance between a and b they're at the same horizontal line so y is zero at 6 p.m y is now 120 so the change in y is 120 minus zero and that's kilometers so i changed 120 kilometers in four hours so if we divide 120 by 4 we can see that dy dt is 30 kilometers per hour another way in which you can determine that same answer is to add up 12 and 18 because both of these values they act in such a way to increase the y value so 12 plus 18 will give you 30. now let's organize the data so we have a right triangle this is x y and z and then here is ship a and this is ship b so we said that x is 160 kilometers y is 120 kilometers and we don't currently have the value for z now dx dt since x doesn't change dx dt is zero dy dt is 12 plus 18 so it's 30 kilometers per hour and the goal in this problem is to calculate dz dt so let's begin so first we know that z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared x is 160 and y is 120. 160 square that's 25 600 and 120 squared is 14 400. so adding up these two numbers and this is equal to forty thousand so that's z squared the square root of forty thousand is two hundred so now we have z so at this point what we can do is differentiate both sides with respect to time so the derivative of z squared is 2z times dz dt the derivative of x squared is zero because x is a constant and for y squared is going to be two y d y dt dividing both sides by two we have z dz dt is equal to y d y dt so z is 200 and y is 120 d y dt is 30. so let's divide both sides by 200. so the z dt is going to be 120 times 30 divided by 200 which is 18. so the zdt is 18 kilometers per hour that's how fast it's changing you 

Transcript for: Related Rates - Airplane Problems
now let's focus on some airplane problems as it relates to related rates an airplane is flying horizontally with a speed of 400 miles per hour at an altitude of three miles above a radar station let's draw a picture so let's say this is the ground and we're going to say this is the radar station and let's say this is the airplane and so it's traveling horizontally let's say in this direction and we could turn this into a right triangle let's call this x y and z so the airplane is moving at 400 miles per hour horizontally so x is increasing by 400 miles every hour so we have dx ct our goal is to calculate how fast the distance between a plane and a radar station how fast that's changing when the plane is five miles away from the radar station so eventually the plane is going to be here at some point and y is equal to three because the plane is traveling at an altitude of three miles above the radar station but at some point it's going to be five miles away it's not gonna be five miles away at let's say point a at point a it's three miles away but somewhere at point b it's going to be five miles away and five is represented by the letter z that's going to be the direct distance between the plane at some point in a future and a radar station so z is equal to five y is equal to three we don't have the value of x nor do we know what d y dt is but our goal in this problem is to calculate dz dt since z is the distance between a plane and a radar station and we want to find out how fast z is changing with respect to time now what should we do in this problem how can we go about solving it now the first thing we need to realize is that y is not a variable it's a constant the plane will always be three miles above the radar station in the vertical direction the altitude will not change it's always going to be i'm not sure what just happened there but the plane will always be three miles above the ground so since y doesn't change d y dt is 0. now we need to calculate x and so we have a right triangle therefore z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared the same way as c squared is a squared plus b squared according to the pythagorean theorem now z is five and y is three five squared is twenty-five three squared or three times three that's nine twenty-five minus nine is sixteen and the square root of 16 is four so x is equal to four so now that we have x we can now calculate the z dt so using the same formula let's perform implicit differentiation but with respect to time the derivative of z squared is going to be 2z times dz dt and the derivative of x squared is going to be 2x dx dt now the derivative of y squared is going to be zero because y is a constant if you do two y d y d t d y d t is still zero so the whole thing is going to be zero now let's divide both sides by two so z is five x is four and d x e t is four hundred so let's divide both sides by five and this should give us the answer so 400 divided by five 40 divided by five is eight so 400 divided by five is eighty and eighty times four is three twenty and so this is the final answer it's 320 miles per hour so that's the rate at which the distance between the plane and the radar station is changing number two two airplanes are about to intersect at a single point the first plane is traveling west at 400 miles per hour and is currently 160 miles east from the convergence point the second plane is traveling south at 750 miles per hour and is currently 300 miles north from the convergence point at what rate is the distance between the two planes changing so let's draw a picture so let's say this is the convergent point and we have a plane traveling south and another plane traveling west so the first plane is currently let me draw a right triangle because these problems they always deal with right triangles let's call this plane number one and plane number two so the first plane we can see that is traveling west and it's moving at 400 miles per hour and it's currently 160 miles east of this convergence point let's call this x and this is y and z is going to be the distance between them the second plane is 300 miles north of the convergence point but it's traveling south at 750 miles per hour so in this problem we can see that x is 160 and y is 300 we don't currently have the value of z but we do know dx dt what's dx dt and dydt in this problem now dx dt is negative 400 and the reason why it's a negative is because as the plane travels towards the convergence point x is decreasing that side of the triangle is getting shorter and so because x is decreasing dx dt is negative now for d y dt y is also decreasing as the second plane travels south so d y dt is a negative it's going to be negative 750. the goal of this problem is to calculate dz dt that's what we want to do so we don't need this picture anymore and so we can get rid of it now let's calculate z before we calculate dz dt just like the last problem we know that z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared x in this example is 160 and y is 300. one sixty squared that's twenty five thousand six hundred and three hundred squared is ninety thousand so if we add these two numbers we're going to get 115 hundred and so that's equal to z squared so we have to take the square root of both sides the square root of one hundred fifteen six 600 is 340. so now that we have the value of z we can now focus on getting dz dt so what we're going to do is differentiate this equation with respect to time and so we're going to have 2 z dz dt and that's equal to 2x dx dt plus 2y dy dt now let's divide everything by two and now we can plug in the information that we have so z is 340 times dz dt x is positive 160 dx dt is negative 400 y is 300 and the y dt that's negative fifty one sixty times negative four hundred plus three hundred times negative seven fifty that's equal to negative two hundred eighty nine 000 and to get dz dt we need to divide both sides by 340. so dz dt is equal to negative 850 miles per hour so that's the final answer and there is another way in which you can get this answer as well so for this problem where x y and z are all variables none of them are constants this holds true it turns out that dz dt squared is equal to dx dt squared plus dy over dt squared so we know that dx dt is negative 400 when you square it becomes positive dy dt is negative 750 so 400 squared which is 160 000 plus 750 square that's 562 500 and then adding those two numbers that's going to be hundred twenty two thousand five hundred so that's equal to dz over dt squared so now let's take the square root of both sides if you take the square root of seven two two five zero zero the calculator will give you a fifty but keep in mind when you take the square root of a number you get two possible answers plus or minus a 50. but based on this problem because the two planes are converging towards a point the distance between them is decreasing because the planes are getting closer and so we know that dz dt has to be negative so this is the final answer this is just another way to get the same answer you 

Transcript for: Related Rates - The Shadow Problem
in this lesson we're going to focus on the shadow problem in related rates so we have a six foot man and he walks at a rate of three feet per second away from a street light and his street light is 21 feet tall now let's draw a picture so let's say that's the ground and here is the street light now let's say this is the person now let's draw a line from the street light to the person and so this is going to be the shadow that's formed behind the person from the light now we said the street light is 21 feet tall and the man he's six feet tall and let's say the distance between the man and the light is x and s will represent the length of the shadow and l will be the sum of x and s at what rate is the length of his shadow changing when he is eight feet from the light and then part b at what rate is the tip of the shadow moving when he is ten feet from the light so part a is asking for ds dt that's the rate at which the length of the shadow is changing so that's how fast s is changing part b at what rate is the tip of the shadow moving when the tip of the shadow moves in this case that's going to be equal to the rate at which l is changing so part b is really looking for the ali team so make sure you understand that so the sdt tells you the rate at which the length of the shadow is changing but the ldt tells you the rate at which the tip of the shadow is moving so how can we calculate ds dt let's start with that one first what do we need to do in order to find it now for this problem you need to draw similar triangles so let's draw the first triangle that's the large one where this is 21 and this is x plus s so that's for this triangle right here now let's draw the second triangle the smaller one where this is six and this is s now we need to set up a proportion between these two triangles and if you're unsure how to do it here's something that can help you to do it correctly note that these two triangles have the same angle theta if you draw the large triangle it has the angle theta and the small triangle has the same angle theta and both triangles are right triangles now according to sokatoa hopefully you know your trick tangent theta of the first triangle that is this one it's equal to the opposite side which is 21 divided by x plus s now tangent theta of the second triangle it's also equal to opposite over adjacent so therefore we could set 21 over x plus 6 i mean x plus s and set that equal to 6 over s so we have this so far whenever you have two fractions separated by an equal sign you can cross multiply so if we cross multiply we're going to have 21s is equal to 6 times x plus s now let's distribute 6. so this is going to be 6x plus 6s next we can subtract both sides by 6s so 21 minus 6 is 15. so we have 15s is equal to 6x now once you get to this part of the equation we can perform implicit differentiation let's find the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to time so the derivative of 15s is going to be 15 times the derivative of s which is one times d c t based on the constant multiple rule and the derivative of six x is going to be six times one times dx dt so now at this point we need to plug in what we have our goal is to calculate ds dt but we need the xct so what is dxd tina's problem so notice that the man he's walking at a rate of three feet per second away from the lamp so he's going in this direction now that tells us the rate at which x is changing every second x is increasing by 3 feet so because x is increasing and not decreasing if he was walking towards the lamp x would be decreasing but in this problem he's moving away from the street light so x is going up therefore dx dt is positive three feet per second if he was moving toward the streetlight x will be decreasing and dx dt would be negative three feet per second so now that we have dxet we could plug it into this equation so we have 15 ds dt that's equal to 6 times 3. now let's divide both sides by 15. so ds dt is six times three and 15 is five time stream so we could cancel a three and now this gives us the final answer for part a dsct is going to be six over five feet per second so that's the rate at which the length of the shadow is changing every second it changes by six over five feet or 1.2 feet now let's move on to part b at what rate is the tip of his shadow moving when he is 10 feet from the light so this time we need to calculate dl dt how can we do that first let's get rid of some stuff now let's start with this equation which we had earlier 21 divided by x plus s is equal to 6 over s using similar triangles now instead of using x plus s we're going to replace that with l because notice that x plus s is equal to l so therefore we have this expression 21 over l is 6 divided by s now let's cross multiply so we have 21s is equal to 6 times l and now in this form let's differentiate both sides with respect to time so the derivative of 21s is going to be 21 times ds dt and the derivative of 6l is going to be 6 times dl dt now we have dsct already so we can plug it in to this expression so what we have now is 21 times 6 over 5 and that's equal to 6 times dl dt so at this point we no longer need this picture so we can get rid of it now i'm going to work on this side here let's multiply both sides of this equation by one over six if we do so the sixes will cancel on both sides so on the left side all we have left over is twenty one over five and on the right side we have dl over dt and so this is the final answer it's 21 over 5 feet per second and if you want to convert that into a decimal you can break up twenty one into twenty plus one twenty divided by five is four so it's four and one fifth one over 5 is 0.2 so dl dt is 4.2 feet per second so that's the rate at which the tip of the shadow is moving when he is 10 feet from the light now these two values we really don't need so those numbers are irrelevant in this problem and that's it for this video so now you know how to solve this shadow problem thanks for watching you 

Transcript for: Related Rates - The Baseball Diamond Problem
in this video we're going to go over the baseball diamond problem so we have a baseball player running from second base to third base at a speed of 20 feet per second he is currently 50 feet away from the third base and the baseball diamond field it has the shape of a square where all the side lamps are 120 feet so we need to determine the rate at which the distance between a player and the home plate is changing let's start by drawing a picture so this is going to be first space second third and this is the home plate now the player is somewhere between second and third base and he's moving towards the third base at a speed of 20 feet per second and he's currently 50 feet away from the third base now the baseball diamond field is the shape of a square and the side length is 120 so this is 120 this is 120 every side of this field is 120. so the distance between the home plate and third base is 120 feet now our goal is to focus on the rate at which the distance between the player and the home plate is changing so notice that we have a right triangle so let's redraw the picture somewhere on the side here let's call this x y and z so the goal of this problem is to determine the rate at which z is changing so we need to calculate dz dt so how can we figure out the value of dz dt what do we need to do first we need to make a list of what we know already so we have the value of x x is 50 and we have y y is 120 we currently do not have the value of z but what is the value of dx dt what is that now we know that it has to do with this number 20 feet per second is x increasing or decreasing as the player moves from second to third base this distance highlighted in green will decrease and that is represented by x so x is decreasing which means that dx dt has to be negative so in this case it's a negative 20 feet per second so now that we have this information we no longer need the pictures so let's get rid of the pictures at this point and make some useful space now we still had a right triangle so we have this equation z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared so let's calculate z x is fifty y is one twenty fifty squared is twenty five hundred and one twenty times 120 is 14 400 now if we add these two numbers this will give us 16 900 and that's equal to z squared so let's take the square root of both sides to get z so z is 130 feet so now that we have z we can calculate the z t so let's go ahead and find the derivative of this equation with respect to time so the derivative of z squared is two z dz dt and the derivative of x squared is two x d x e t the derivative of y squared will not be two y d y dt dy dt is zero so if you recall in this picture this is why this is x and this is z the person is moving towards the third base so therefore x is changing but as he's running toward the third base y is not going to change it's going to remain 120 and so because y is fixed it doesn't change it's a constant at that instant until he's moving from third base to home plate until he's moving in this direction that is then only then will y be changing but until then while he's going from second to third base y is constant and so we need to treat it as a constant and the derivative of a constant is zero so we have this expression now let's divide both sides by two and let's replace x with i mean z with 130 and x we can replace that with 50 and dx dt is negative 20. so let's divide both sides by 130. so the first thing we could do is cancel a zero and so we have 50 times negative 2 which is negative 100 divided by 13. so this is the answer it's negative 100 over 13 feet per second and let's convert that to a decimal so that's about negative 7.69 feet per second so that's the rate at which the distance between the player and the home plate is changing this is the final answer you 

Transcript for: Related Rates - Angle of Elevation Problem
an airplane travels horizontally at a speed of 500 miles per hour at an altitude of three miles above the ground an observer sees the plane flying toward him at an angle of elevation of 60 degrees find a rate at which the angle of elevation is changing at this instant so let's begin with a picture so let's say this is the ground and here is the observer and here is the plane it's flying towards the observer and it's at an altitude of three miles above the ground so this is the angle of elevation theta and the plane is traveling forward at a speed of 500 miles per hour we need to determine the rate at which the angle of elevation is changing f is instant so that is d theta dt that's what we need to determine so let's call this y x and z now what else do we know so we have the value of y y is equal to 3 in miles we don't know the value of x but we do know the rate at which x is changing so is x increasing or decreasing notice that as the plane travels towards the person x is decreasing therefore dx dt is negative 500 miles per hour now there's one more piece of information that we know and that is that theta is 60 degrees so to conserve space let me get rid of some stuff so keep in mind we're looking for d theta dt now the only picture that we really need is basically a right triangle for this problem now from this picture how can we calculate x we don't have anything with z we don't know what z or dz dt is we have theta and we have y how can we calculate x so notice that tangent theta based on sohcahtoa is equal to the opposite side y divided by the adjacent side which is x x is adjacent or next to theta z is the hypotenuse so tangent of 60 degrees theta is 60 is equal to 3 divided by x now let's cross multiply so this is going to be 3 and that's equal to x times tan 60. tangent of 60 degrees is the square root of 3. you could type that in your calculator make sure it's in degree mode if you don't have access to a calculator you need to be familiar with the 30-60-90 triangle across the 30 is 1 across the 60 is root 3 across the 90 is 2. so tangent 60 will be opposite divided by the adjacent side so root 3 over 1 which is the square root of 3. so it's good to know the 30 60 90 reference triangle and the 45-45-90 reference triangle so now let's divide both sides by the square root of three so x is equal to three divided by the square root of three so if we rationalize it the square root of three times the square root of three is the square root of nine which is three and three divided by 3 is 1. so x is equal to the square root of 3. now that we have the value of x how can we calculate d theta dt looking at the information that we have we don't have anything dealing with z so it doesn't make sense to use z squared equals x squared plus y squared the only equation that relates x y and theta is the tangent equation that we had before so let's go back to that one tangent theta is equal to y over x now it's important to understand that x is a variable but y is a constant as the plane travels toward the observer it will remain at an altitude of 3. therefore y is not going to change the plane is flying horizontally so the altitude will always be 3 miles so y is constant so i'm going to rewrite this expression as the constant times the variable now before i take the derivative of this expression i still need to rewrite it one over x is the same as x to the minus 1. now in this form i'm going to differentiate both sides with respect to time the derivative of tangent is secant squared times theta or secant squared of theta and the derivative of the angle theta is going to be d theta dt now to differentiate this expression we need to use the constant multiple rule so the constant is y we can rewrite that times the derivative of x to the minus one so now we need to use the power rule it's going to be negative one x to the negative two and then times dx dt now secant is one divided by cosine so secant squared is one over cosine squared and here we have negative y i'm gonna move the x to the bottom so it's gonna go from x to negative two and change to x to the positive two and then times dx over dt so theta is 60 therefore this is going to be cosine of 60 degrees but let's not forget to square it times d theta over dt now we know that y is equal to 3 and x is the square root of 3. and then times deoxy t which is negative five hundred so now what is cosine of sixteen so let's go back to the thirty sixty ninety triangle so we said across the thirty was a 1 across the 60 is the square root of 3 across the 90 is 2. now don't forget about sohcahtoa so let's use the cob part in sokatoa so cosine of 60 degrees is going to be the adjacent side that's a divided by the hypotenuse adjacent to 60 is one and the hypotenuse is across the box that's two therefore cosine of 60 degrees is one half so this is going to be one divided by one half squared times d theta over dt and that's equal to negative three and the square root of three squared the square root and the the exponent will cancel or you could see it as three squared is nine and the square root of nine is three so that becomes three now going back to the left side one squared is one two squared is four so we have one over one fourth times d theta over dt negative three divided by three is negative one and negative one times negative five hundred is positive five hundred now what is one divided by one over four to simplify that complex fraction multiply the top and the bottom by four so four times one is four and then four times one fourth the fours will cancel and so you just get one on the bottom and so four divided by one is just four so we have four times d theta dt and that's equal to five hundred dividing both sides by four five hundred divided by four is one hundred and twenty five now what are the units for d theta dt theta is going to be in radians unless specified otherwise and time we could see that time is in hours so it's going to be radians per hour so that's the rate at which the angle is changing per hour let's say if you want it in seconds here's what you can do so start with what you're given 125 radians per hour and convert to minus first one hour is equal to 60 minutes and then convert to seconds so one minute is equal to 60 seconds do it in such a way that the unit hours will cancel and the unit minutes will cancel as well so we're left with radians per second if you ever need to change it so it's going to be 125 divided by 60 divided by 60 again so it's going to be a very small number if you want it in radians per second so it's .0347 radians per second if you want it in radians per minute just focus on this portion so it will be 125 over 60 and so you could say d theta dt is in it's equal to 2.08 3 radians per minute so you can report your answer in any one of these units but for the most part since the speed is in miles per hour you probably want the final answer to be in radians per hour you want the time to match which is usually the case you 

Transcript for: Hyperbolic Trig Functions - Basic Introduction
in this video we're going to talk about hyperbolic functions and let's compare it with trigonometric functions trigonometric functions are based on the unit circle the formula for that is x squared plus y squared is equal to one that is the equation of a circle where the radius has a value of one that's why it's called the unit circle since R is one now hyperbolic functions their base not on a unit circle but on the hyperbola one form of it looks like this that particular form has this equation x squared minus y squared is equal to one the only difference is we've exchanged a plus with a minus now in trigonometry you've seen this identity this is known as the Pythagorean identity it's cosine squared plus sine squared is equal to 1. now for hyperbolic functions there's a similar identity it's hyperbolic cosine squared of x minus hyperbolic sine squared of X is equal to one notice the similarities this equation corresponds to this equation here the equation of a circle this equation corresponds to the equation of a hyperbolic function now hyperbolic functions are basically combinations of exponential functions hyperbolic sine is equal to e to the x minus E to the negative x divided by 2. so as you can see it's just the combination of these two exponential functions now hyperbolic cosine it's very similar to hyperbolic sign the only difference is we're going to change the minus sign to a plus so it's e to the X Plus e to the negative x divided by 2. so you may want to write these down because we'll be using these formulas a lot in certain practice problems now hyperbolic tangent is equal to hyperbolic sine divided by hyperbolic cosine much in the same way as the regular tangent function is sine over cosine so if we were to take hyperbolic sign in its exponential form and divide it by hyperbolic cosine we would get this this is another form of hyperbolic tangent e to the x minus e to the negative X over e to the X Plus e to the negative X now we could simplify that equation even further if we multiply the top and the bottom by each of the X notice what happens first I'm going to rewrite it e to the negative X is 1 over e to the x so this is what we have and we're going to multiply the top and bottom by e to the x e to the x times e to the x when you multiply by Common bases you need to add the exponents for instance a squared times a to the Third is a to the two plus three which is a to the 5. so e 3x times e to the X you have X Plus X you get 2X when we multiply these two ECX times 1 over e to the X they cancel and we're just going to get minus one here this is going to give us e to the 2X and this is just going to give us Plus 1. so hyperbolic sine not only equals hyperbolics I mean hyperbolic tangent doesn't just equal hyperbolic sine over hyper cosine it equals e to the x minus E to the negative X over e to the X Plus e to the negative X and it also equals e to the 2x minus 1 over e to the 2x Plus 1. so those are the different forms in which you could represent hyperbolic tangent now let's talk about the reciprocal functions hyperbolic cosecant is simply one over hyperbolic sine very similar to how cosecant is one of a sine hyperbolic secant is 1 over cosine and hyperbolic cotangent is one over hyperbolic's tangent so those are the basic formulas that you want to know when it comes to hyperbolic trig functions now let's talk about some of the graphs of the hyperbolic trig functions so this is the graph of hyperbolic sign we can represent it as Y is equal to hyperbolic sine of x the domain for this graph is all row numbers and the range is all real numbers next we have hyperbolic cosine it looks like an upward parabola and it starts at a y value of 1. so the domain is going to be all row numbers X could be anything if you analyze it from left to right it goes from negative Infinity to the left positive Infinity to the right now the range of hyperbolic cosine is limited the lowest y value is one the highest y value is infinity so it goes from 1 to Infinity next we have hyperbolic tangent which is bounded by two horizontal asymptotes y equals one and Y equals negative one hyperbolic tangent touches the origin at zero and then it's going to follow each asymptote so that's a rough sketch of hyperbolic tangent and this is hyperbolic cosine now the domain for hyperbolic tangent if we look at the X values the graph goes all the way to the left from negative Infinity and it goes all the way to the right to positive Infinity so the domain for all three of these functions is all real numbers now the range it's bounded by the two horizontal asymptotes so the lowest you can be is negative one and the highest it could be is one but it doesn't include those values so we don't have a close interval we have an open interval so it's negative one to one so that's basically it for this video I wanted to give you just a basic introduction into hyperbolic trig functions I'm going to have other videos on this topic so feel free to take a look at that so if you go to the YouTube search bar type in hyperbolic trig functions organic chemistry tutor all the videos that I have on this

interested but now let's get back to the video 

Transcript for: The Graphs of Hyperbolic Trig Functions
in this video we're going to focus on the graphs of the hyperbolic functions so let's start with hyperbolic sine let's discuss the graph of this function now hyperbolic sine is a combination of two exponential functions it's e to the x minus E to the negative X divided by 2. so think of it as being one-half e to the X and then minus one half e to the negative X or C it this way see it as the sum of these two graphs so one half e to the X Plus negative one-half e to the negative X so what we're going to do is we're going to graph each of these components of the hyperbolic sine function let's start with one half e to the x so one half e to the x is an exponential function that looks like this now if that's one half e to the x what's the negative one-half e to the negative X so to graph that we could use transformations first let's start with negative one-half e to the positive X here Y is negative X is positive with this graph we're reflecting it over the x-axis so it would look like this as you can see this is a reflection of this graph over the x-axis now if we were to plot negative one-half e to the negative X add in this negative relative to this function what's going to happen is we're going to reflect over the y axis so instead of this graph going this way it's going to be going that way like this so that's a negative one-half e to the negative X relative to the original function because we reflected it over the x axis and the y-axis the combination of that is basically reflecting it over the origin relative to that function now e to the zero is one so when you multiply that by a half this point is at one half this point here is negative one-half of course it's not drawn to scale but that's what those values should be hyperbolic sine is the combination it's the sum of these two functions so when you add a half and a negative half it's going to add up to zero so at the origin it's zero now when X goes to positive Infinity in other words as we move to the right one half e to the x is going to go to positive Infinity negative one-half e to the negative X will go to zero so when X becomes very large this portion becomes significant that is this portion and this part of the graph becomes it goes to zero so what that means is that as we move to the right hyperbolic sine its graph is going to look like one half e to the X when X becomes large so it's going to follow this asymptote now as we move to the left as X approaches negative Infinity and this part of hyperbolic sine as we can see it goes to zero it becomes insignificant and this part goes to negative Infinity as X gets as X goes to negative Infinity so hyperbolic sign is going to mirror this graph as we go to the left so that's how we can graph hyperbolic sine from the exponential functions the domain for hyperbolic sine is negative Infinity to Infinity the range is also negative Infinity to Infinity now that we have hyperbolic sine already on the page for us let's graph the reciprocal hyperbolic cosecant so knowing that hyperbolic cosecant is the reciprocal function of hyperbolic sine how would you draw the graph for hypolic cosecant when when the Y value of the hyperbolic sine function becomes very large the Y value of hyperbolic cosecant will be very small so for instance let's say this has a y value of 10. 1 over 10 is basically 0.1 in other words as this goes up hyperbolic cosecant is going to go towards zero now as we approach the origin the Y value becomes smaller and smaller so let's say over here where the Y value is one-half for hyperbolical secant the reciprocal of one-half is two over here where the Y value might be 0.1 over 0.1 is 10. so as we get closer to zero hyperbolic cosecant is going to go to Infinity it's going to become larger and larger so at one half it will be at two and as we move to the right where y increases for hyperbola hyperolical secant wise constant decrease is going to get closer and closer to zero and as we approach zero hyperbolical secant is going to go towards Infinity now the same is true for the other side over here the values are negative so hyperbolical secant will be negative over here as we go towards negative Infinity in the y direction hyperbolic secant will go towards zero as we approach zero it's going to go towards negative Infinity so that's the graph of hyperbolic cosecant it's a rough sketch of it but I want you to understand how we get it from hyperbolic sign by the way the domain for hyperbolic cosecant notice that X can be everything except zero so if we look at it from the left side it goes from negative Infinity we have a vertical asymptote at zero and it goes to positive Infinity so this is the domain four hyperbolic cosecant for the range is the same thing it goes down towards negative Infinity we have a a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero and then it goes all the way up to positive Infinity so this is the range for hyperbolic cosecant y could be everything except zero now let's talk about the graph of hyperbolic cosine hyperbolic cosine is very similar to hyperbolic sine but instead of e to the x minus E to the negative X is going to be e to the X Plus e to the negative X over 2. so we can break it up into these two exponential functions one half e to the X Plus one half e to the negative X now we already know the shape of one-half e to the x is going to look like this at least that's a rough sketch of it now one half e to the negative X we have a negative in front of X but not in front of Y so it's only going to reflect over the y-axis not the x-axis so that's positive one-half e to the negative X hyperbolic cosine is the sum of those two functions so at x equals zero both of these functions have a value of a half one half plus one half is one so hyperbolic cosine is going to start at a y value of one now when X goes to positive Infinity this part goes to zero this part goes to Infinity so hyperbolic cosine is going to mirror this graph when X becomes very large so it's going to follow this asymptote as we move to the left and go as X goes towards negative Infinity this part one half e to the X goes to zero as you can see here and one half e to the negative X goes to positive Infinity so this is going to have a greater contribution to this function when X goes to negative Infinity therefore hyperbolic cosine is going to mirror one half e to the negative X as we move to the left because this goes to zero that goes to positive Infinity 0 plus positive Infinity is just positive Infinity so that's the graph of hyperbolic cosine the domain is all real numbers X could be anything but the range is limited the lowest y value for hyperbolic cosine is one and one is included so we're going to use a bracket and it goes up to positive Infinity so now that we have the graph of hyperbolic cosine we can talk about the graph of hyperbolic secant secant is the reciprocal of cosine so looking at hyperbolic cosine the graph for it how would you draw the graph for hyperbolic cosecant what would you do so looking at this point it's one one over one is just one so at one we're going to have the same point let's say this is one here now let's say this point has a y value of 2 and this point has a y value of 3. this point two will also have a y value of two this one will have a y value of 3. when Y is 2 1 over 2 if we take the reciprocal of two we get one over two which is a half so at this point it's going to be over here it's going to be at one half now if we take 1 over 3 this will be at 1 3. and then one over fourth one fourth and so we could see what's happening here as the Y values go to Infinity as they get larger and larger the Y values of the reciprocal function is going to go to zero now the right side is a reflection of the left side dude they're symmetrical so this side it's going to be the same so hyperbolic cosecant will look something like this so that's the graph of hyperbolic secant it won't go past one as long as there's a one fungus if you put a 2 in front of it everything doubles so it'll go up to two but for unmodified hyperbolic secant the range is going to be from negative actually hyperbolic secant doesn't go below y equals zero so the range is going to be from 0 to 1. Now 1 is included we have an actual point here so we are going to have a bracket for the range of hyperbolic secant as for the domain you can see that it's rival numbers analyze it from left to right X goes to negative Infinity it starts from negative infinity and goes all the way to positive Infinity so that's the graph of hyperbolic secant now let's move on to hyperbolic tangent if you've seen my previous videos you know that hyperbolic tangent has three forms there's this one hyperbolic sine over cosine and there's this form e to the x minus E to the negative X over e to the X Plus e to the negative X and then there's this form e to the two x minus one over e to the 2x Plus 1. now it's easier to graph hyperbolic cos I mean hyperbolic tangent using this form of that function so if we were to make a table and let's say we were to plug in 0. into this expression what would we get so this would be e to the 0 minus 1 over e to the zero plus one anything raised to zero power is one so one minus 1 is going to give us zero so hyperbolic tangent of zero is zero which means it touches the origin now let's look at the end behavior of this graph as X goes to positive Infinity what happens to y well this becomes e to Infinity minus 1 over e to the infinity plus one the minus one and the plus one they become insignificant now both of these are e to the two x they're going to grow at the same rate and because they grow at the same rate as X increases when X becomes very large they will cancel and this is going to approach one so as X goes towards positive Infinity y will approach one now what about when X goes to negative Infinity what happens to y so this will be e to negative Infinity minus 1 over e to the negative infinity plus one e to the negative Infinity is one over e to the affinity and 1 over a large number is a small number so 1 over e to Infinity is virtually zero it gets closer and closer to zero zero minus one is negative one zero plus one is one and this approaches negative one so when X becomes very large when y approaches 1 which means that we have a horizontal asymptote at one when X becomes very small when it goes to negative Infinity y approaches negative one so that's going to be another horizontal asymptote so hyperbolic tangent as we go to the left it's going to get closer and closer to negative 1 and as we go to the right it's going to get closer and closer to positive one so the graph it looks like this it passes through the origin it starts from one asymptote and gradually Works its way towards the other asymptote so that's how you can graph hyperbolic tangent if you know just one point in this case the origin and if you know the end behavior of the function so now that we know the graph for hyperbolic tangent let's focus on the reciprocal graph hyperbolic cotangent so what can we say about hyperbolic cotangent now over here the Y value is one if we were to find the reciprocal of that one over one is one but keep in mind this is not equal to one but it's less than one so let's say if it's 0.9 1 over 0.9 is a number that's close to one but just above one so what's going to happen is hyperbolic cotangent will have the same asymptotes at one and negative one the difference is as we get closer to one but we're still under or below one hyperbolic cotangent will approach one but it's going to be above one as opposed to below one so it's going to approach the asymptote but from above it rather than below it so it's going to be on this side here and the proof of that is just remember one over point nine if you were to plug it in your calculator I don't have one with me right now it's going to be a bit A number close one but bigger than one and the same is true over here here it might be like negative 0.9 1 over negative 0.9 might be like negative 1.1 or something so we need to know is that for hyperbolic cotangent it's going to approach the asymptote but rather than from within the two isotopes it's going to be outside of it now as we approach Zero from the right side let's say this is 0.1 over 0.1 might be like Point like positive 10. so as we approach Zero from the right side it's going to go up towards positive Infinity as you approach Zero from the left side this is not going to be like positive 0.1 but negative 0.1 over negative point one is like negative 10. so this is going to go towards negative Infinity from the left side as you get closer to zero so that's the graph of hyperbolic cotangent is going to look something like this it's not a perfect sketch but that's the general shape it's outside of the two horizontal asymptotes and because this goes to zero we're going to have a vertical asymptote at x equals zero because one over zero is undefined so now let's talk about the domain and range the domain for a hyperbolic tangent we can see that it's all real numbers ask for the range it's bounded by the two horizontal asymptotes now for hyperbolic cotangent we need to incorporate the vertical asymptote so looking at it from left to right X goes from negative Infinity it stops at zero at the vertical asymptote and X can continue towards positive Infinity so we just have to take out zero so it's going to be negative Infinity to zero Union zero to Infinity as for the range we're going to analyze it from the bottom to the top the lowest y value is negative Infinity then it stops at this asymptote at negative one it starts back up at positive one and goes to positive Infinity so for the bottom half the range is going to be negative Infinity to negative 1. and it's going to stop there and for the upper half it's going to start at positive 1 and go to positive Infinity so that's the graph for hyperbolic cotangent of x so hopefully this video gave you a good introduction into understanding the graphs Behind These functions and how they work because once you understand where they come from you can easily remember how to draw them rather than simply relying on memorization

in this video we're going to talk about how to evaluate hyperbolic trig functions so what is the value of hyperbolic sine of zero in order to find that answer we need to know the formula for hyperbolic sine of x it's equal to the exponential functions e to the x minus E to the negative x divided by 2. so all we need to do is substitute X 4 0 in that formula so it's e to the 0 minus E to the negative 0 over 2. anything raised to the zero power is one so it's one minus one over two so becomes 0 over 2 which is zero so that is the value of hyperbolic sine of zero it equals zero now let's try another example what is the value of hyperbolic cosine of zero feel free to pause the video if you want to try that example so first we need to know the formula for hyperbolic cosine it's e to the X Plus e to the negative x divided by 2. so this is going to be e to the 0 Plus e to the negative zero over two e to the zero is one e to the negative zero is the same as e to the zero which is going to be one one plus one is two two divided by two is one so hyperbolic cosine of zero is equal to one much in the same way that sine zero is equal to zero and cosine zero is one try this one what is the value of hyperbolic sine of ln2 go ahead and work on that problem so this is going to be e raised to the ln2 minus E to the negative ln2 over 2. now what is e to the ln2 when deal with natural logs you have a base e here it turns out that these cancel out and you just get two for the next one this negative one I want to move it to the exponent of 2. that's the property of logs that will allow me to do so this will be ln2 to the minus 1. 2 to the negative 1 is the same as one-half so these will cancel and I'm just going to get one half here now what I'm going to do is I'm going to multiply the top and bottom by 2 just to get rid of the fraction so here I have 2 times 2 which is 4. 2 times a half is one and on the bottom two times two is four four minus 1 is 3 so I get 3 over 4. as the final answer so that's the value of hyperbolic sine of ln2 it's 3 over 4. try this one what is the value of hyperbolic cotangent of ln5 so hyperbolic cotangent and put it here is hyperbolic cosine over hyperbolic sine here we have cosine so this is going to be e to the ln5 plus e to the negative ln5 divided by 2. and then for hyperbolic sine of ln5 we're going to use this formula so it's e to the ln5 minus E to the negative ln5 over 2. so multiplying the top and bottom by 2 we can get rid of this now e to the Ln 5 is simply 5. and this is going to be plus e to the Ln 5 to the minus 1 or 1 over 5. over 5 minus and we could do the same thing here this is going to be e to the Ln 1 over 5. so the E's will cancel giving us one over five on the bottom the same thing is going to have happen but it's going to be negative one over five so I'm going to multiply the top and the bottom fraction by 5. so we have 5 times let's do that again 5 times 5. is 25 and then 5 times 1 over 5 that's just going to be 1. here we have 25 and 5 times negative one-fifth that's going to be negative one 25 plus 1 is 26 25 minus 1 is 24. 26 is 13 times 2 24 is 12 times 2. so we can cross out a 2. and this is going to be 13 over 12. so that is the value of cotangent natural log of 5. it's 13 over 12. let's try this one what is the value of hyperbolic sine of 3. so this is going to be e to the 3 minus E to the negative 3. over 2. so I'm going to rewrite that as one-half e to the third minus E to the negative 3. and there's really not much we can do in terms of simplifying it at this point all we could do right now is plug this into the calculator now it's good to know that e to the negative 3 . this is very close to zero so we can approximate our answer and say it's approximately one half e to the Third so let's go ahead and get the values for these answers so let's start with the the one on top 0.5 e to the third minus E to the negative 3. this is 10.0179 as for this answer 25 e to the third power it's 10.04 277. in both cases we could round the answer and say it's approximately 10.0 and we would be accurate enough so if you want to get an approximate simplified answer you could say it's this if this was to the second power I wouldn't really get rid of this one because it might still be significant but if it's like negative 3 negative 4 negative 5 it's going to be close enough to zero where you can just ignore that part so that's basically it for this video now you know how to evaluate hyperbolic trig functions now this is for those of you who want to get access to all of my video playlists and exam review videos all in one spot so if you go to video.net and if you go here click more video playlists you can get access to all the different video playlists that I have on my YouTube channel and also the final exam review videos as well so feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance 

Transcript for: Hyperbolic Trig Identities
in this video we're going to go over common identities that you want to be familiar with in regards to hyperbolic functions so let's start with the even odd identities hyperbolic sine of negative X is equal to negative hyperbolic sine of x so the hyperbolic sine function it's an odd function notice that the sign in front of it changed from positive to negative as we inserted a Negative X now as for hyperbolic cosine this is an even function hyperbolic cosine of negative X is equal to positive hyperbolic cosine of x now let's focus on the Pythagorean identities let's make a comparison between the trigonometric functions and the hyperbolic functions now the trigonometric functions they're associated with the unit circle which has the equation x squared plus y squared is equal to 1 squared I mean or just one now for the Pythagorean identities which are related to the unit circle cosine squared plus sine squared is equal to one for the hyperbolic function we have the equation of a hyperbola which opens in a horizontal Direction it's x squared minus y squared as opposed to x squared plus y squared equal one and we have this identity hyperbolic cosine squared minus hyperbolic sine squared that's equal to one so very similar to this one but instead of a positive sign we have a negative sign now in trig you've seen this Formula 1 plus tangent squared is equal to one I mean not one is equal to secant squared now the hyperbolic version of that equation looks like this so 1 minus hyperbolic tan squared is equal to secant squared so the only difference is instead of a plus we have a minus sign now for the next one it's going to be a little bit more different 1 plus cotangent squared is equal to cosecant squared and for the hyperbolic version of that equation we have 1 minus hyperbolic cotangent squared and it's equal to not positive but negative hyperbolic cosecant squared so there's a lot of similarities but a few differences between the two types now let's move on to the double angle formulas the double angle formula for hyperbolic sine of 2x it's two hyperbolic sine of x times hyperbolic cosine of x this is very similar to the double angle formula for the regular trig function sine 2x is 2 sine x cosine X so this is not really much of a difference there now if a hyperbolic cosine of 2x it's going to be equal to hyperbolic cosine squared of X Plus hyperbolic sine squared of x next we have the power reducing formulas hyperbolic sine squared is equal to negative one Plus hyperbolic cosine 2x over 2. and then cosine squared is 1 plus cosine 2x over 2. so those are the power of reducing formulas for the hyperbolic functions of cosine and sine now let's move on to the sum and difference formulas hyperbolic sine of X Plus y or rather let's color code this X plus or minus y this is going to be hyperbolic sine of x times hyperbolic cosine of Y plus minus so notice the sign is not inverted when this is plus this will be plus when it's minus this will be minus and then we have hyperbolic cosine of x times hyperbolic sine of Y now for cosine there's some similarities but a few differences here instead of sine cosine is just going to be cosine cosine so we have hyperbolic cosine of x hyperbolic cosine of Y the signs won't be inverted they'll be the same and then hyperbolic sine of x times hyperbolic sine of Y so those are the power reducing I mean those are the sum and difference formulas for hyperbolic functions now if you want to convert from a hyperbolic function to an exponential function here are three formulas you want to be familiar with which by now I'm pretty sure you already know hyperbolic sine of x is equal to e to the x minus E to the negative X over 2. hyperbolic cosine of x is e to the X but Plus e to the negative X over 2. hyperbolic tangent of x is sine over cosine so if you were to divide these two the twos will cancel and you'll get e to the x minus E to the negative X over e to the X Plus e to the negative X now if you were to multiply the numerator and the denominator by 80 to the x this equation becomes this e raised to the 2x minus 1 over e raised to the 2X Plus 1. so that's how you can convert hyperbolic sine cosine and tangent into its exponential form now what about going from an exponential equation to a hyperbolic equation if you have e to the X you can replace that with hyperbolic cosine of x plus hyperbolic sine of x s for e to the negative X that is hyperbolic cosine of x but minus hyperbolic sine of x e to the 2X if you want it in terms of tangent it's 1 plus hyperbolic tangent of X over 1 minus hyperbolic tangent of x you can also basically Square this equation to get e to the 2X and that'll give you cosine squared plus 2 sine cosine plus sine squared the cosine squared plus sine squared and that could be converted into cosine 2X the 2 sine cosine part you could use a double angle formula and convert that to sine 2X so you can convert e to the 2X into cosine sine much like you see what you have here so notice that if this is 1x this is 1x if this is 2x we have 2x here now there's a formula that really connects these equations together here it is so we know that e to the x is hyperbolic cosine plus hyperbolic sine so that means that e raised to the x raised to the N power is equal to hyperbolic cosine of x plus hyperbolic sine of X raised to the n and you can look this up this formula here is equal to cosine hyperbolic cosine n times x plus hyperbolic sine n times x let's write that as e raised to the NX so e to the 3x is cosine hyperbolic cosine 3x plus sine 3x e to the 4X you can make that hyperbolic cosine 4X plus hyperbolic sine 4X so with this formula you can easily convert any exponential function with a base e into its hyperbolic version so that's basically it those are some common hyperbolic identities that you want to be familiar with for this particular section 

Transcript for: Verifying Hyperbolic Trig Identities
in this lesson we're going to focus on verifying hyperbolic identities so here we have hyperbolic cosine plus hyperbolic sine equal to e to the x how can we prove that by the way before working on these problems I recommend watching a video entitled hyperbolic trig identities where I give you a list of formulas that you want to be familiar with using those formulas you can solve problems like this one so if you haven't seen that video and if you don't have a list of hyperbolic identities in front of you you may want to watch that video and write down those formulas so let's go ahead and begin in order to verify this identity we need to convert cosine and sine into their exponential form so hyperbolic cosine is equal to e to the X Plus e to the negative x divided by 2. hyperbolic sine is equal to e to the negative x minus e to the negative X over 2. now because we have common denominators we can combine it into a single fraction so e to the X Plus e to the negative X plus e to the x minus E to the negative X over 2. e to the negative X and negative e to the negative X we could cancel them one e to the X plus one e to the x that's going to be 2 e to the x 2 divided by 2 is 1 so we get e to the x is equal to e to the x so that's how we can verify in this particular hyperbolic identity now let's try another one that's very similar to that one hyperbolic cosine of x minus hyperbolic sine of x let's prove that this is equal to e to the negative X so we could use the same formulas like we did before cosine hyperbolic cosine is going to be e to the X Plus e to the negative X over 2. hyperbolic sine is going to be e to the x minus E to the negative X over 2. but this negative sign will have to be distributed so let's combine it into a single fraction since we have common denominators this is going to be ECX Plus e to the negative X and then negative e to the x and then these two negatives will cancel giving us positive e to the negative X e to the X and negative e to the X will cancel these two we can add them together and we're going to get 2 e to the negative X over 2. and then we could cancel the twos giving us e to the negative X so that's how we can verify that particular identity now let's try this one let's verify the double angle formula of hyperbolic sine so we know hyperbolic sine of 2x is 2 times hyperbolic sine of x times hyperbolic cosine of x how can we verify this particular identity we need to use the sum and difference formulas hyperbolic sine of X Plus y is equal to 2 sine actually not a 2. it's hyperbolic sine of x times hyperbolic cosine of x plus if we see a plus here this is going to be a plus and then it's this should be a y not an X and then Plus hyperbolic cosine of x times hyperbolic sine of Y using this formula we can prove it what we need to do in order to get 2x is we need to replace y with x plus X is 2X so this is going to be X Plus X so in this formula everywhere we see a y we're going to replace it with an X so we don't need to change sine of x cosine y that's going to become cosine X and hyperbolic sine of Y is going to be hyperbolic sine of x now notice that these two are the same sine times cosine is the same as cosine times sine so we could simply add the coefficients this has a 1 this has a one one plus one is two so we got 2 sine times cosine and on this side X Plus X is 2X so that's how we can prove the double angle formula it's by using the sum in difference formulas for the hyperbolic function identities let's try another similar one so hyperbolic cosine of 2x let's prove that it's equal to hyperbolic cosine squared plus hyperbolic sine squared so we need to know the sum and difference formula for hyperbolic cosine and here it is hyperbolic cosine of x plus y is hyperbolic cosine of x times hyperbolic cosine of Y and then Plus hyperbolic sine of x times hyperbolic sine of Y so in order to get 2x we need to replace X I mean we need to replace y with x so instead of hyperbolic cosine y we're going to write hyperbolic cosine X and instead of hyperbolic sine of Y we're going to write hyperbolic sine of x so that's what we did that's what we've done so far we've just replaced y with x now X Plus X we can make that 2X cosine times cosine is cosine squared and sine times sine is sine squared so that's how we can verify the double angle formula for hyperbolic cosine now let's try this one go ahead and verify that hyperbolic sine of negative X is equal to negative hyperbolic sine of x now we're going to use the sum and difference formulas for hyperbolic sine so I'm just going to write the formula first so hyperbolic sine of X Plus y is going to be hyperbolic sine of x times hyperbolic cosine of Y Plus hyperbolic cosine of x times hyperbolic sine of Y now in order to get Negative X what should X and Y be well we want X at the very end so we should keep X as X Y we want to make that negative 2x because x minus 2x will give us Negative X so all we're going to do is replace y with negative 2x wherever we see it so this is going to be hyperbolic sine of negative 2X so x minus 2x is negative X we're going to keep hyperbolic sine of x now what can we do with this hyperbolic cosine of negative 2X now recall the even identity of hyperbolic cosine hyperbolic cosine of negative X is the same as hyperbolic cosine of x so hyperbolic cosine of negative 2x should be the same as hyperbolic cosine of 2x hyperbolic sine of negative 2X now we know this identity to be true but we're trying to prove it but we can still apply it this is going to be negative hyperbolic sine of 2x now hyperbolic cosine of 2x we could use the double angle formula for that and that is cosine squared plus sine squared so cosine squared of x plus sine squared of x and here we have negative cosine of x and then we can use the double angle formula for sine that's going to be 2 sine cosine so now let's see what we can do here let's distribute sine so we're going to have sine of x times cosine squared and then here this is just going to be sine cubed and for this one we have negative 2 sine times cosine squared now these two expressions we can combine them so this is 1 minus 2 and it's going to become negative 1. so right now we have sine cubed and then minus sine cosine squared what I'm going to do is I'm going to factor out a sign so I'm going to be left with sine squared and then minus cosine squared now what is sine squared minus cosine squared what can we do with that if you recall for trig functions cosine squared plus sine squared is 1. for hyperbolic functions cosine squared minus sine squared is 1. so what I'm going to do first is I'm going to factor out a negative 1. negative cosine becomes positive cosine and I'm going to write that first positive sine squared will become negative sine squared and this is one of those identities that you need to be familiar with this one equals one so we have a negative 1 in front or at least I'm going to move it to the front and this part equals one so thus we have hyperbolic sine of negative X there should be an H here is equal to negative hyperbolic sine of x so at least that's one way we can prove it now let's move on to our next example problem cosine squared of x minus hyperbolic sine squared of X is equal to 1. go ahead and verify that identity now what we need to do is convert cosine and sine into their exponential form cosine is e to the X Plus e to the negative X divided by 2. but it's squared sine is e to the x minus E to the negative X divided by 2. so what we need to do is we need to foil so I'm going to rewrite it first we have e to the X Plus e to the negative X it's squared so we're going to multiply by itself and then 2 squared that's 2 times 2 that's simply 4. here we'll have something similar over 2 squared which is 4. e to the x times e to the X that's going to be e to the 2X and then multiplying those two together e to the x times e to the negative X X plus negative X is is zero so we got e to the zero now these two will also give us e to the zero and negative X plus negative X that's negative two x now because we have the same denominator we can combine it into a single fraction now here we have e to the x times e to the X that's e to the two x but we have a negative in front so I'm going to distribute that negative sign these two ECX and e to the negative X the exponents X plus negative X adds up to zero so we get e to the negative X we have a negative sign here plus the negative sign in front so it's going to be positive e to the zero as for these two the exponent will be zero so that's another e to the zero this is negative that's negative so it's going to be positive e to the zero and then these two here Negative X plus negative X that's going to give us an exponent of e negative 2X these two negative signs make it positive plus the third negative sign makes it negative overall so now e to the 2X will cancel with negative e to the 2X positive e to the negative 2x will cancel with negative e to the negative 2X and we have four e to the zeros anything raised to zero power is one and four divided by four is one so that's how we can verify this particular hyperbolic trig identity now let's try another one 1 minus hyperbolic tan squared is equal to hyperbolic secant squared let's verify that now hyperbolic tangent is hyperbolic sine over hyperbolic cosine but in this case it's going to be squared secant is the reciprocal of cosine so secant squared is one over cosine squared actually let's keep this as secant now I want cosine squared on the bottom and we have two terms we need to make it a single term so let's multiply one by cosine squared over cosine squared this will give us common denominators so now that we have common denominators we can combine the two fractions into a single fraction so we're going to have cosine squared minus sine squared all over cosine squared now from the last example we saw that cosine squared minus sine squared that is equal to 1. so now we have one over cosine squared is equal to secant squared and one over cosine is secant so we have secant squared is equal to secant squared so that's it for this verification now let's try another problem go ahead and verify this identity one plus hyperbolic tangent divided by 1 minus hyperbolic tangent is equal to e to the 2X now one I'm going to multiply by cosine over cosine but particularly hyperbolic cosine so one can be replaced with hyperbolic cosine over hyperbolic cosine tangent is sine over cosine so we're going to have hyperbolic sine over hyperbolic cosine now what do you think we need to do next after this notice that each of these four fractions have the same denominator so we're going to multiply every term by cosine so each denominator will be canceled actually let's keep that so we're going to have hyperbolic cosine plus hyperbolic sine divided by hyperbolic cosine minus hyperbolic sine now if you've seen my video on hyperbolic trig identities it's important to know that e to the x is cosine plus sine so we can replace this with e to the x you can also replace cosine with e to the X Plus e to the negative X over 2. you could do it that way as well just in case you didn't know that this was equal to e to the x we'll do it using the more commonly used functions so I'm going to replace cosine with e to the X Plus e to the negative X over 2. and then sine with e to the x minus E to the negative X over 2. so multiplying the top and bottom by 2 the twos all the twos will be canceled so that's what we have in the numerator and in the denominator we have e to the X Plus e to the negative X here we need to distribute the negative so it's negative e to the x these two negatives will cancel giving us positive e to the negative X e to the negative X will cancel here and e to the X will cancel so e to the X Plus e to the X that's going to be 2 e to the x and then e to the negative X Plus e to the negative X that's 2 2 e to the negative X 2 divided by 2 can be canceled to one so we're left with e to the X over e to the negative X and when you divide by a common base you need to subtract the exponents so we'll subtracting positive X by negative X which becomes the two negative signs will make it positive so X Plus X we get e to the 2X

how would you evaluate this expression the inverse of the hyperbolic cosine of one what is that equal to now when dealing with inverse functions X and Y are switched so what we have is the Y value and what we're looking for is the x value in other words hyperbolic cosine of what number is one that's what we're looking for so how do we figure this out well there are different ways in which we can do this recall the hyperbolic cosine function is e to the X Plus e to the negative X over 2. so we could replace this with one that's equal to y and we could solve for x now looking at this equation you could find the answer intuitively you know that anything to the zero power is one and one plus one over two will give you one therefore this must be e to the zero because that will give us one which means X is zero so the answer for this problem is going to be zero thinking about it in an intuitive way but fortunately there are formulas that we could use to evaluate the inverse hyperbolic functions so here's the formula for the inverse hyperbolic cosine function it's equal to the natural log of x plus the square root of x squared minus one and you need to be familiar with the domain the domain is from 1 to Infinity so you want to make sure that this is in the domain which is this before using that function so now let's use it let's evaluate the hyperbolic the inverse hyperbolic cosine function of zero so all we got to do is replace X actually this should be a one not a zero all we have to do is replace x with one one squared minus 1 is 0. the square root of zero is zero plus one we get one the natural log of one is zero so that's how we can confirm our answer simply using that formula now let's look at another example go ahead and evaluate the inverse hyperbolic sine of one now there's a formula that we want to use and here it is the inverse hyperbolic sine of x is equal to the natural log of X plus the square root of x squared plus one so it's very similar to the inverse hyperbolic cosine function the only difference is instead of a minus sign we have a plus sign so now let's substitute x with one so this is going to be Ln one plus the square root of one squared plus one so this simplifies to the natural log of one plus the square root of 2. so that is the exact answer but if we want to get the decimal equivalent of that we can plug it in to a calculator and that's going to be about point eight eight one three seven and we could confirm this using the exponential function of hyperbolic sine so we know hyperbolic sinus e to the x minus e to the negative X over 2. this is the Y value this is the x value so if we were to take this value plug it into X for this equation we should get y and that's how we can confirm if we have the right answer so let's go ahead and do that let's evaluate this at this point so this is going to be e raised to the point eight eight one three seven minus E to the negative point a eight one three seven all divided by 2. go ahead and plug that in you may want to put this in parentheses and don't forget this negative sign right here I got .999995 which is approximately one so that's how you know that you have the right answer you can check it with this formula now here's some other formulas that you want to add to your list so you have the first two but you want to add these four other equations to your list of formulas if you have this on a test by the way uh going back to the inverse hyperbolic function hyperbolic sine function the domain is all numbers X can be anything now for the inverse of the hyperbolic tangent function the formula is one half natural log 1 plus X over 1 minus X and the domain is restricted on the open interval from negative one to one so it doesn't include negative one and one but it could be anywhere between those two values now for the inverse hyperbolic cotangent function it's very similar to the previous one it's one half natural log now it's going to be X Plus 1 which is the same as 1 plus X on the bottom it's x minus one instead of one minus X now the domain for this is going to be negative Infinity to negative 1 Union 1 to Infinity next up we have the inverse hyperbolic secant function and that's going to be the natural log of 1. plus the square root of 1 minus x squared divided by X the domain for that is going to be 0 to 1. so we have a bracket at one one is included but not zero if we put a zero it's going to be undefined in that fraction next we have the inverse hyperbolic cosecant function it's going to be Ln is actually very similar to this but instead of one fraction it's broken down into two fractions according to my textbook it's 1 over X Plus the square root of one plus x squared over the absolute value of x and the domain is negative Infinity to zero Union zero to Infinity so the domain is all real numbers except zero so those are the inverse hyperbolic functions that you want to be familiar with and their corresponding formulas 

Transcript for: Graphs of Inverse Hyperbolic Functions
in this lesson we're going to talk about how we can graph the inverse hyperbolic functions so if you already know how to graph the regular hyperbolic functions all you need to do to graph the inverse hyperbolic functions is you need to reflect the original graph across the line Y equals X so we're going to talk about how to do that so here's a rough sketch of the regular hyperbolic sine function to sketch the inverse of that what we want to do is we want to we want to draw the line Y equals X my graph is not perfect but we'll draw a rough sketch of that so the blue line that's going to be the inverse hyperbolic sine function now the regular hyperbolic sine function it has the domain rival numbers the domain of the regular function becomes the range of the inverse function so the range is going to be Orville numbers the range of the regular hyperbolic sine function is also horrible numbers and that will become the domain of the inverse hyperbolic sine function now let's look at another example so let's focus on hyperbolic cosine hyperbolic cosine has a minimum value at y equals one however it's not a once one function because it doesn't pass the horizontal line test so when we're graphing the inverse function we're only going to plot this side of it so notice that this has an a y-intercept of one the inverse function will have an x-intercept of one now if we were to take the inverse of this whole thing it would look something like this but this is not a function because it doesn't pass the vertical line test so we're only going to take this half of it and we can draw the line Y equals X and we can see this side is a reflection of this side across the line Y equals X so this blue curve that is the inverse of cosine the red curve that is the regular hyperbolic cosine function the domain for the hyperbolic cosine function is all real numbers and the range we see the lowest y value is one the highest is infinity the range of the hyperbolic cosine function becomes the domain of the inverse hyperbolic cosine function we can see that the domain it goes from positive one to Infinity now the range is going to be restricted because we didn't draw the entire version of this just one half of it so we're going to have to restrict the range and we could see the lowest y value is zero and this goes up to positive Infinity so it's going to be from 0 to Infinity now let's focus on tangent let's draw the graph of the regular hyperbolic tangent function and it looks like this it's finally between the asymptotes y equal negative one and y equal 1. so that is hyperbolic tangent now to draw the inverse of that it's important to know that the horizontal asymptotes will become vertical asymptotes so instead of horizontal asymptotes at y equal negative one and y equal 1. we're going to get vertical asymptotes at x equals negative one and that x equals one so this graph is going to look like this all of the X values have been switched with Y values so for instance as X goes to Infinity y approaches 1. if we switch that as y approaches Infinity X goes to 1. now the domain for hyperbolic tangent is all real numbers so the range for hyperbolic inverse tangent is going to be our real numbers the range for regular hyperbolic tangent we could see it's bounded between the two horizontal asymptotes the domain for hyperbolic tangent will be bonded between the two vertical asymptotes and that's going to be negative one to one now let's move on to cosecant so here is the graph for hyperbolic cosecant in this graph we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero and the vertical asymptote at x equals zero because these are the same if you were to flip them it won't change for the inverse function and even if you were to draw the line Y equals X if we reflected this side across the line Y equals X it will become this side and if we reflect this side across it it becomes that side so for this particular graph cosecant and inverse cosecant will have the same shape so that is the graph for hyperbolic inverse cosecant they have the same domain negative Infinity to zero Union zero to infinity and they have the same range negative Infinity is zero Union zero to Infinity now let's talk about secant so this is the graph of hyperbolic secant it has a domain of all real numbers and a range from 0 including one go into and include in one now if we were to draw the inverse of that if we were to flip the graph it would look something like this however this function is not a once one function it doesn't pass the horizontal line test and so this won't pass the vertical line test therefore we have to restrict it to the upper half of the graph so only this side notice that we have a y-intercept of one so here we're going to have an x-intercept of one so that is the graph of inverse secant we only have this side but as we go as X goes towards positive Infinity we could see Y is approaching zero here it's going to flip as y approaches positive Infinity X goes to zero along the y axis X is zero so you can see how X and Y they're switched here now what can we say about the domain and range the range goes from zero to one and when we switch it the domain will be the same it's going from zero to one and we can see it here the lowest x value is zero the highest is one but it doesn't include zero but it does include one so we should have a bracket at one now the range is going to be different because we don't have the entire graph we just have half of it so the range is going to be half of the domain so the range is going to be 0 to Infinity that's half of this but zero is included y can be zero right here so we have a bracket at zero now let's move on to our next one and that is hyperbolic cotangent of x this function has two horizontal asymptotes this one is going to be at y equals one and Y equals negative one this function also has a vertical asymptote at x equals zero and it has this shape now if we were to reflect this shape across the line Y equals X this side is going to look like that side so the inverse function is going to have the same shape here however there are some differences the horizontal asymptotes will become vertical asymptotes and the vertical asymptote will become a horizontal asymptote so because we have two horizontal asymptotes we're going to have two vertical asymptotes instead of one and negative 1 for y it's going to be 1 and negative 1 for x so this one is at x equals negative one this one is at x equals positive one now the vertical asymptote at x equals zero will become a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero X and Y will be switched but now this part will be the same so that is the graph of hyperbolic inverse hyperbolical tangent now for cotangent the domain is negative Infinity to zero Union zero to Infinity so looking at it from left to right all we have to do is remove the vertical asymptote the domain for a hyperbolic cotangent will become the range for our inverse hyperbolical tangent so that's negative Infinity to zero Union zero to Infinity so looking at the Y values all we need to remove is the horizontal asymptote y equals zero now the range for regular hyperbolic cotangent we need to remove everything in the middle between the two horizontal asymptotes so negative one to one so the bottom half here is going to be negative infinity and it's going to stop at negative one and the top half will continue from one and go to positive Infinity now the range will become the domain for this function it's going to be negative Infinity to negative one Union One to Infinity so for the X values here it's negative infinity and here we stop at negative one the first vertical asymptote for this second part we're going to start back up at positive one and go to positive Infinity as we can see here so that's basically it for the graphs of the inverse hyperbolic functions 

Transcript for: Derivatives of Hyperbolic Functions
in this video we're going to focus on the derivatives of hyperbolic functions so let's start with the derivative of hyperbolic sine this is equal to hyperbolic cosine so you may want to take some notes on this we'll work on a few practice problems shortly the derivative of hyperbolic cosine is hyperbolic sine it's a little bit different from the corresponding trig function Intrigue the derivative of normal sine is just cosine but the derivative of cosine is negative sine but for hyperbolic functions the derivative of hyperbolic cosine is positive hyperbolic sine the derivative of hyperbolic tangent is hyperbolic secant squared the derivative for hyperbolic cosecant X is negative cosecant or hyperbolic cosecant times hyperbolic cotangent of x now the derivative for hyperbolic secant x that's negative hyperbolic secant times hyperbolic tangent now the derivative for cotangent is negative cosecant squared now let's prove this derivative if you recall sine hyperbolic sign it's e to the x minus E to the negative X over 2. let me make sure I have the right formula because sometimes my memory may fail me but that is the correct formulas that's hyperbolic sign and hyperbolic cosine it's the same thing but the only difference is we're going to have a plus sign instead of a minus sign so to differentiate hyperbolic sign we're differentiating that expression e to the x minus E to the negative X over two the derivative of e to the U is e to the U times U Prime so the derivative of e to the axis e to the x times the derivative of x which is one so that's just e to the x the derivative of e to the negative X is e to the negative x times the derivative of negative X which is negative one so we get that so this becomes e to the x these two negative signs they cancel so it's plus e to the negative X over two which is what we have here and that is equivalent to hyperbolic cosine so that's how you can prove this particular derivative now let's work on some practice problems go ahead and differentiate hyperbolic sine of 4X and also hyperbolic cosine of X cubed feel free to pause the video as you work on this the derivative of hyperbolic sine of U where U is a function of X as opposed to just X this is going to be hyperbolic cosine of U times the derivative of the inside or U Prime so for this this is going to be hyperbolic cosine we'll keep the inside part the same 4X times the derivative of 4X which is 4. so it's four hyperbolic cosine of 4X so that's how we can find the value of that derivative for the next one the derivative of hyperbolic cosine we know it's hyperbolic sine we'll keep the inside the same and now we need to take the derivative of the inside the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared so we can write the answer as 3x squared hyperbolic sign of X cubed now let's try some more examples go ahead and find the derivative of hyperbolic secant x to the fourth and let's try the derivative of x squared hyperbolic sine of x try those two examples so for the first one we just have to use the chain rule the derivative of secant is secant tan but with a negative sign so we're going to have hyperbolic well negative secant times x to the fourth and then times hyperbolic tangent x to the fourth and then we need to differentiate the inside part the derivative of x to the fourth is four x cubed so we can rewrite this as negative 4X cubed hyperbolic secant x to the fourth times hyperbolic tangent x to the fourth all right so moving to the next one we have the product rule and if you recall here's the product rule so if we have F times G we want to find the derivative of that it's going to be F Prime G Plus f g Prime so this is f and hyperbolic sine is G so F Prime the derivative of x squared is going to be 2X times G we'll keep that the same and then plus F which is just x squared times G Prime the derivative of hyperbolic sine which is going to be hyperbolic cosine so that is the answer for the second example now let's try a natural log problem go ahead and find the derivative of Ln hyperbolic sign of x and try this as well the derivative of Ln hyperbolic cosine of x squared now just review when you're finding the derivative of outline U where U is a function of X it's going to be U Prime over U so in this example for the first one U is just hyperbolic sine of x U Prime is the derivative of hyperbolic sine which is cosine so U Prime over U this is going to be hyperbolic cosine over hyperbolic sine and cosine over sine that is cotangent so the final answer is hyperbolic cotangent of x now for the next one we see that U is hyperbolic cosine of x squared U Prime the derivative of that is going to be the derivative of hyperbolic cosine is hyperbolic sine we'll keep the inside part the same and then take the derivative of the inside part which is 2X so U Prime over u u Prime is 2X hyperbolic sine of x squared and then divided by U the U variable so that's hyperbolic cosine of x squared and sine over cosine we can make that tangent so the final answer is going to be 2x times hyperbolic tangent of x squared so those are some simple ways in which you can differentiate hyperbolic functions as you can see the rules are very similar to differentiating other functions using the product rule the quotient Rule and the chain rule 

Transcript for: Derivatives of Inverse Hyperbolic Functions
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the derivative of inverse hyperbolic functions so let's go over some formulas that you need to know you may want to write these down the derivative of the inverse hyperbolic sine function of the variable U where U is a function of x it's equal to U Prime over the square root of U squared plus 1. next we have the derivative of the inverse hyperbolic cosine function of U and this is equal to U Prime over the square root of U squared minus 1 as opposed to plus one now moving on to tangent the derivative of the inverse hyperbolic tangent function of U is going to be U Prime over 1 minus U squared there's no square root for that now the derivative for the inverse hyperbolic cosecant function of the variable U is going to be negative U Prime over the absolute value of U times the square root of 1 plus u squared now for secant it's going to be very similar negative U Prime over U times the square root of 1 minus U squared so for some reason it doesn't have the absolute value here as in the case of inverse hyperbolic cosecant and then we have one more the derivative of the inverse hyperbolic cotangent function of U is equal to U Prime over 1 minus U squared which is exactly the same as the inverse hyperbolic tangent function of U now let's work on some practice problems go ahead and find the derivative of this function of the inverse hyperbolic sine function of 4X feel free to work on that problem so what I'm going to do first is I'm going to write the formula the answer is going to be U Prime over the square root of U squared plus 1. now the variable U is whatever we see inside of the inverse function so in this case that's going to be 4X U Prime is the derivative of 4X which is 4. so all we got to do is plug that into that formula and it's going to give us the answer so it's 4 over the square root 4x squared Plus 1. 4x squared that's 4X times 4X which is 16x squared plus 1 and that's it let's try another example so let's find the derivative of hyperbolic cosine the inverse hyperbolic cosine function of X cubed so using the formula it's U Prime over the square root of U squared minus 1. so in this problem U is equal to X cubed U Prime the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared so this is going to equal let's plug it into that formula so it's 3x squared divided by the square root of U squared which is X cubed squared minus 1. so that's going to be 3x squared over the square root of 3 times 2 is 6. so we get x to the 6 minus 1. so that's it for that particular problem now let's move on to our next example let's find the derivative of the inverse hyperbolic tangent function of the square root of x so for hyperbolic tangent the formula is U Prime over 1 minus U squared so U is equal to the square root of x which is if you rewrite it it's x to the one-half U Prime is going to be using the power rule it's going to be one half X one half minus one is negative one-half if we rewrite it it's 1 over 2 square root X so plug in all that into this formula we're going to get U Prime which is 1 over 2 square root X all divided by 1 minus U squared so 1 minus U is the square root of x and then we're going to square it so this simplifies to 1 over 2 square root X over 1 minus the square root of x squared is simply X now what we're going to do is we're going to multiply the top and bottom by 2 square root X so these will cancel giving us our final answer which is 1 over 2 square root x times 1 minus X so that is the derivative of the inverse hyperbolic tangent function of the square root of x now let's try another example go ahead and find the derivative with respect to X of the inverse hyperbolic cosecant function of x but it's going to be raised to the third power go ahead and try that so for this one we need to use the chain rule we need to differentiate this as if it's X cubed or Y cubed so we're going to work on the outside part this is going to be 3 and then we're going to keep everything on the inside the same and then the exponent we're going to subtract it by 1. much as if you differentiate X cubed you get let me say that again if you differentiate X cubed you get 3x squared but now we need to differentiate the inside part cosecant the formula for that where did I put that paper so here's the formula for the inverse hyperbolic cosecant function it's negative U Prime over absolute value of U times the square root of 1 plus u squared in this case U is equal to X U Prime is going to be just one so it's going to be times negative U prime or negative one over the absolute value of x times the square root of 1 plus x squared so putting it all together we can multiply 3 and negative one so it's going to be negative 3 times what we have here inverse hyperbolic cosecant of x and that's going to be raised to the second power all divided by the absolute value of x times the square root of 1 plus x squared so that is the final answer now let's work on one more problem let's say we have this equation Y is equal to 6 times the inverse hyperbolic sine of 3x and then Plus actually let's make this 6x and then minus 2 square root 1 plus 9x squared go ahead and find the derivative of that expression so what we have here for this part is a product rule problem the derivative of FG is going to be the derivative of the first part times the second plus the first part times the derivative of the second part so we're going to apply that for this portion so the derivative of the first part 6X is just 6. we're going to keep the second part the same and then we'll keep the first part the same which is 6x now we're going to differentiate the second part so to do that we need to know the formula for the derivative of inverse sine and we know it to be U Prime over the square root of U squared plus 1. so in this example U is 3x U prime minister 3. so this is going to be times 3 over the square root of U squared which is 3x squared and then plus one now we need to differentiate this expression so it might be good to rewrite it first we could take away the square symbol and replace it with a one-half exponent so using the power rule we're going to move this to the front it's going to be negative 2 times the half we'll keep the inside part the same subtract this by one and then multiply by the derivative of the inside the derivative of one is zero but for nine x squared that's going to be 18x the 2 and the one-half will cancel so this is going to be minus 18x on top now because we have a negative exponent this expression is going to go on the bottom of the fraction now positive a half was a square root on the numerator negative one-half will be a square root in the denominator so this is going to be the square root of 1 plus 9x squared so now let's simplify what we have so here we have 6 times the inverse hyperbolic of sine of 3x 6X times three dots positive 18x 3x squared is 9x squared but we can rewrite it as 1 plus 9x squared and we can just rewrite this so these two are opposites to each other if you add them you get zero therefore the final answer is six inverse hyperbolic sine of 3x so that's it for this lesson now you know how to find the derivative of inverse hyperbolic functions 

Transcript for: Integral of Hyperbolic Functions
in this lesson we're going to cover the integrals of hyperbolic functions so if you have a sheet of paper you want to take some notes let's go ahead and begin the indefinite integral of hyperbolic cosine is hyperbolic sine it's the opposite of the derivatives the derivative of hyperbolic sine is cosine the antiderivative of hyperbolic sine is hyperbolic cosine plus c now for hyperbolic secant it's going to be hyperbolic tangent plus c and for the integral of hyperbolic cosecant squared is going to be negative cotangent the integral of secant tan is negative secant and the indefinite integral of hyperbolic cosecant cotangent is negative cosecant so those are some integrals of hyperbolic functions that you want to be familiar with so let's work on a few examples what is the indefinite integral of hyperbolic cosine 2x DX feel free to try that problem the integral of hyperbolic cosine is going to be hyperbolic sine 2X now this is a linear function all we need to do is we need to divide divide our answer by the derivative of this linear function the derivative of 2x is going to be 2 and then we need to add the constant of integration so that's going to be the answer it's one half hydraulic sine of 2x plus c try this one find the indefinite integral of hyperbolic sine 5x Plus 4. the integral of hyperbolic sine is going to be hyperbolic cosine the inside part is going to be the same now because we have a linear function we could simply divide by the derivative of 5x Plus 4. the derivative of 5x is 5 the derivative of the constant 4 is 0. so this is just going to be 5. and then plus the constant C now let's move on to the next example what is the indefinite integral of hyperbolic cotangent let's make this cotangent of x go ahead and try that problem now the first thing we want to do is we want to rewrite cotangent as cosine over sine and of course we have a DX here now we have two functions in a fraction so one thing that we want to try to do is we want to try to use the U substitution let's make U equal to hyperbolic sine d u the derivative of U is going to be the derivative of hyperbolic sine which is hyperbolic cosine and then it's going to be times DX so we can replace hyperbolic cosine times DX with du because they're equal to each other we could also replace hyperbolic sine with u because they're also equivalent to each other so we have this which we can write it as 1 over u d u the antiderivative of 1 over U is the natural log of U and of course we'll have our constant of integration C at this point we can replace the U variable with what it equals which is sine so the final answer is the natural log of hyperbolic sine of X plus c so that is the antiderivative of hyperbolic cotangent now let's try this problem let's integrate the cube of hyperbolic secant times hyperbolic tangent the derivative of tangent will give us secant squared not secant cubed so we don't want to do that but the derivative of U I mean derivative of secant gives us secant tangent so we want to make U the U variable equal to secant because doing so once we differentiate U to get d u this will give us secant's hand but we need to pay attention to something and that is that there's a negative sign here because for the regular trig functions the derivative of secant is secant tan positive secant tan but for the hyperbolic functions the derivative of hyperbolic secant is negative hyperbolic secant times tangent so we want to be mindful of that negative sign now I need to rewrite this such that I can get rid of a secant tan so I'm going to rewrite this as secant squared and then secant tangent now I'm going to multiply both sides of this equation by negative 1. so I get Negative d u is equal to positive secant tangent DX so at this point I can replace hyperbolic secant tangent DX with negative d u because they are equivalent to each other and I can replace secant squared with u squared Since U is equal to secant so this is going to be U squared times negative d u which we could say this is the integral of negative negative integral of U squared du using the power rule that's going to be U to the Third over three and then plus c so this is negative 1 3 and we can replace U with secant so it's going to be secant hyperbolic secant to the third power of X plus c so this is our final answer using U substitution so now you know how to integrate some common hyperbolic functions 

Transcript for: Limits of Hyperbolic Functions
in this video we're going to talk about how to evaluate the limits of hyperbolic functions so here we have three examples regarding hyperbolic science and to do this it's really helpful if you have a graph in front of you so I recommend drawing a graph for hyperbolic sign a rough just a rough schedule will do and it looks something like this so now what happens to the Y value of this graph as we approach Infinity along the x-axis so that means as we approach to the right as X goes to an to positive Infinity notice what happens to y y goes up to positive Infinity so that's going to be the limit as X approaches positive Infinity for a hyperbolic sign now what about as X approaches negative Infinity in this case we're going to the left along the x-axis following the curve we can see it goes down to negative Infinity in the y direction so the Y value will be negative Infinity now what about as X approaches 0 from the right so here's the origin has an x value of zero as we approach it from the right the Y value becomes zero so that's going to be the answer for that problem so that's how you can evaluate the limit of hyperbolic functions now let's try some other examples let's move on to tangent what is the limit as X approaches positive Infinity for hyperbolic tangent feel free to pause the video and work on these problems we'll also look at the left end behavior and what is the limit as X approaches zero from the left side so go ahead and work on those three examples so I'm going to begin by drawing a graph of hyperbolic tangent so hyperbolic tangent has two horizontal asymptotes one at y equals positive one the other one at y equals negative one and the graph is an increase in function and it looks like that so as we approach as X goes to positive Infinity notice the Y value approaches one so that's going to be this answer as we go towards negative Infinity to the left on the x-axis the Y value approaches negative one and for the last one as we approach an x value of Zero from the left side this has a y value of zero so this is going to be equal to zero now let's try some more examples go ahead and find the limit as X approaches positive Infinity of let's say secant hyperbolic secant and let's get the limit as X approaches zero from the left of hyperbolic secant as well so go ahead and try those two problems so let's begin by drawing a graph of hyperbolic secant this graph looks something like this let me draw that better and this point has a y value of one so starting with the first example as X approaches positive Infinity the Y value is zero we're going close and closer to the x axis so this is going to be zero as X approaches zero from the left that is as we follow this curve towards an x value of zero we can see the Y value is one so the best way to really evaluate the limits of hyperbolic functions in my opinion is to draw the graph as long as you know the graphs of these hyperbolic functions it's going to be easy or relatively easy to evaluate the limits now let's try a few examples with cotangent so find the limit as X approaches negative Infinity for hyperbolic cotangent let's also go to positive Infinity and then let's find the limit as X approaches zero be careful with that one so feel free to pause the video and work on those examples let's begin by drawing a graph so hyperbolic cotangent has two horizontal asymptotes just like tangent the first one is that y equals one the second one is at y equals negative one now hyperbolic cotangent also has a vertical asymptote and this one is at x equals zero so the graph looks something like this so that's a rough sketch of the graph for hyperbolical tangent now as we approach as X goes to negative Infinity that is as we go all the way to the left and this curve is approaching a y value of negative one so that's going to be this answer for the next one the limit as X approaches positive Infinity for hyperbolical tangent as we go to the right we're positive Infinity for X's notice that this curve approaches a y value of one so that's going to be positive one now what about at zero as we approach the limit as we approach as X approaches 0 rather what does the limit approach what a value does it converge to now for this one we need to look at the left and the right sided limits if we look at the the left-sided limit so here is when X is zero as we follow the curve going towards zero started from the left notice that this is going down towards negative Infinity now as we follow the curve go into Zero from the right side so here's the right side we're approaching an x value of zero the Y value is going to positive Infinity notice that the left-sided limit and the right-sided limit they're different therefore the limit as X approaches zero does not exist because the left side and the right side they don't match in value they have different values so that's going to be the answer for this one the limit does not exist so that's basically it for this particular topic so now you know how to evaluate limits of hyperbolic functions and it's very helpful if you know the graphs of these functions 

Transcript for: Finding The Linearization of a Function Using Tangent Line Approximations
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the linearization of a function at a certain value so let's try this problem let's say that f of x is equal to x cubed and we want to find the linearization at a equals two so basically what we really are trying to do is we're looking for the tangent line equation when x is two that's the basic idea of what we're doing and you could use this formula l of x is equal to f of a plus f prime of a times x minus a now what is f of a and we know a is two so f of two we just got to plug it into this equation and that's gonna be two to the third power so two times two times two that's eight now we need to calculate f prime of a or f prime of 2. to do that we need to find the first derivative so the derivative of x cubed using the power rule is 3x squared and so f prime of 2 is going to be 3 times 2 squared 2 times 2 is 4 times 3 that's 12. so once you have f of a and f prime of a you're now ready to plug in everything into this equation so l of x is going to be f of a which is 8 plus f prime of a which is 12 times x minus a and a is 2. now at this point all we need to do is simplify this equation so let's distribute 12 to x minus 2. but first i need to make some space so let me get rid of a few things so it's going to be 8 and then 12 times x and then 12 times negative 2 which is negative 24. and so 8 minus 24 that's negative 16. so l of x is going to be 12x minus 16. so this is the linearization of the function when a is two so that's the equation of the tangent line when x is two now one good thing of linearization is it helps us to approximate certain values for instance let's say if we wanted to calculate or estimate the value of 1.99 raised to the third power without a calculator this would not be fun now let's use a calculator so 1.99 to the third power if you type that in it's eight eight zero five nine nine that is the exact answer but we can approximate this value using the linearization function at this particular number so it's going to be 12 times 1.99 minus 16. now let's see if we can do this without a calculator because if we have access to a calculator we could simply type this in so let me just get rid of this stuff so what is 12 times 1.99 without a calculator 1.99 is 2 minus 0.01 and so twelve times two is twenty four and twelve times point zero one is point twelve now twenty four minus sixteen is eight and eight minus point twelve is seven point eight eight because a hundred minus twelve is eighty eight so notice how close these two values are so if you need to approximate some number that is difficult to do without a calculator and if you know the function in this case it's x cubed you can approximate it with a linearization technique without the use of a calculator and so that's how this information can be applied in a typical setting now let's try another problem by the way if you want to see a graph this is the right side of the graph of x cube and the tangent line is basically a line that touches the curve at one point and so you can estimate a certain function value by using the tangent line and the estimation works if the number is close to the point of intersection in this case a was two and so we wanted to estimate 1.99 raised to the third power the reason why it works so well is because 1.99 is very close to two and so this point here the point of intersection that's at x equals 2. so you can use l of x to approximate function values when x is very very close to 2 because that's where the tangent line meets the curve if you try to approximate let's say 2.99 you can't use two as a value you have to use three so you need to create a new tangent line when x is 3 and so basically whenever you want to estimate a number using this process these two numbers have to be very close otherwise the accuracy will be lost you won't get a good estimation now let's try this problem let's say that f of x is equal to the square root of x and a is 4. so find the linearization l of x of the function at the given a value in addition once you have that use it to estimate the square root of 3.99 so first let's determine f of a or f of 4. so f of 4 that's the square root of 4 that's equal to 2. next we need to determine f prime of a so first we need to calculate f prime of x now f of x which is the square root of x if we rewrite that that's x to the one-half so using the power rule it's going to be one-half x to the one-half minus one which is negative one-half and then if we bring the x to the bottom it's gonna be one over two x to the one-half which is the same as one over two square root x so now f prime of 2 i mean f prime of 4 rather because a is 4. that's going to be 1 over 2 times the square root of 4. and the square root of 4 is 2 and 2 times 2 is 4. so f prime of a is 1 over 4 in this example so now let's rewrite the linearization function l of x and we said that was f of a plus f prime of a times x minus a so f of a in red is two f prime of a is highlighted in blue that's one over four and a is this number which is 4. so that is the linearization function and you could simplify if you want to but when estimating this number i'm going to use this form now if you want to simplify this is what you're going to get it's going to be 2 plus 1 4 x and then 1 4 times negative 4 that's going to be negative 1. and so 2 minus 1 is 1. so it's going to be 1 plus 1 4 x so that's the simplified version of l of x that's what it equals now let's estimate the square root of 3.99 so first let's get the exact answer with a calculator so if you type it in this is equal to one point nine nine seven four nine eight four three six those are the numbers that my calculator gave me so now let's use l of x now you have to decide if it's easier to use this form or in this form what do you think i think it might be easier to use this form but in the end i mean both will still be the same so let's calculate l of 3.99 so it's going to be 2 plus 1 4 times 3.99 minus 4. now 3.99 minus 4 that's negative 0.01 now 1 over 4 as a fraction or rather as a decimal is 0.25 now if you're not sure about that you can use long division anytime you need to convert a fraction to a decimal so the numerator goes on the inside now four goes into one zero times so we need to add a zero on the decimal point four goes into ten two times four times two is eight and four times point two is point eight ten minus eight is two add a zero four goes into twenty five times with no remainder i'm run out of space so you get 0.25 so we have 0.25 times negative 0.01 now what is 0.25 times 0.01 let me help you to understand it so 0.25 times 1 is equal to itself if we multiply by 0.1 it's going to be 0.025 we just got to move the decimal point and then if you multiply by 0.01 you got to move the decimal point by 2 spaces so it's going to be 0.00 which is what we're going to have so this is 2 minus 0.0025 two minus point zero zero two five that's going to be one point nine nine seven five for those of you who are not sure you can subtract these numbers the old-fashioned way so this is two and we're going to subtract it by point zero zero two five so first we need to borrow a one so that this becomes ten now we need to take away a one from this one so this becomes a nine a nine and a nine so ten minus five is five nine minus two is seven nine minus zero is nine nine minus zero that's nine again one minus zero is one now if we compare these two numbers 1.9975 and if you look at this portion 1.99749 this part right here you can round that to 1.9 so this is a good approximation of that number and so linearization is very useful for estimating values that look like that you 

Transcript for: Differentials and Derivatives - Local Linearization
in this video we're going to focus on derivatives and differentials particularly as it relates to local linearization so what exactly is a differential when you see d y that stands for the differential of y dx is the differential of x now you need to be able to find it so for example let's say if we have the function y is equal to x to the fourth now if we differentiate both sides with respect to x we know that d y d x the first derivative of the function is equal to 4 x cubed now if you multiply both sides by d x you're going to get this differential d y so d y is equal to 4 x cubed dx so here's another example let's say if y is equal to ln x then d y dx the derivative of ln x that's 1 over x multiplying both sides by dx we'll get that d y is 1 over x times dx so if you need to find the differential d y this is how you can do it so let's go over some more examples so let's say that y is equal to x cubed minus five x plus ten and find the differential d y and then evaluate it using these values x is two and let's say dx is one over four so first we're going to find d y to do that we need to find the derivative of this expression the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of negative five x is negative five and for the constant tan at zero and then we need to multiply this expression by dx so that's how we could find the differential d y now to evaluate d y we need to plug in these values so x is three so this is going to be three times two squared minus five and dx is one fourth two squared is four four times three is twelve and twelve minus five is seven and seven times one fourth is seven over four or one point seven five so d y is equal to 1.75 when dx is 0.25 or 1 4. so that's how you can evaluate d y and this is how you can find it let's try another similar example for the sake of practice so let's say that y is equal to two x cubed minus four x squared plus 8x minus 1. let's say that x is 3 and dx is 0.1 find dy and go ahead and evaluate as well so the derivative of 2x cubed that's going to be 2 times 3x squared which is 6x squared and the derivative of x squared is 2x times 4 so that's going to be 8x and then plus 8. and then times dx so now that we have d y let's go ahead and evaluate it so x is three this is going to be six times three squared minus eight times three plus eight and dx is point one now 3 squared is 9 and 6 times 9 is 54. 8 times 3 is 24. 54 minus 24 is 30 and then plus 8 so that's 38 times 0.1 which is 3.8 so that's the value of d y it's equal to 3.8 now let's say that f of x is equal to x cubed and x is equal to 2 and delta x is 0.01 with this information calculate d y and delta y given the values of x and dx and keep in mind dx is equal to delta x in this situation so dx and delta x they're both .01 now it's important to understand that f of x is the same as y so you could say that y is equal to x cubed so just keep that in mind now let's start by calculating f of 2. f of 2 is going to be 2 to the third which is 8. and then let's calculate f of 2 plus 0.01 so that's x plus delta x so that's 2.01 that's going to be 2.01 raised to the third power and i need to calculate it for that so that's equal to 8.120601 now delta y is the change in y it's f of x plus delta x minus f of x in other words delta y is f of 2.01 minus f of 2. so it's basically the difference between these two values so it's eight point one two zero six zero one minus eight so we can say that delta y is point one two zero 6 0 1. so let's save this answer now let's calculate d y and we're going to compare it to delta y so y is x cubed and d y is going to be the derivative of x cubed which is 3x squared times dx now let's replace x with 2 since that's what it equals and dx is point zero one two squared is four and three times four is twelve 12 times 0.01 is 0.12 so that's the value of d y as you can see 0.12 and 0.1206 they're very close to each other so d y is approximately the same as delta y they're very close if delta x is very small so for the sake of practice let's try another problem so let's say that f of x is equal to the square root of x when x is nine and let's say dx is let's use point zero two so go ahead and try that problem so first we need to calculate f of nine so that's the square root of nine that's three and then f of x plus delta x so this is also delta x by the way so that's going to be 9 plus 0.02 or 9.02 and so that turns out to be 3.003331484 so delta y which is f of 9.02 minus f of 9. so that's going to be the difference between these two numbers and so that's going to be point zero zero so now let's calculate d y and compare it to delta y so using this expression we can see that y is equal to the square root of x and rewriting it that's going to be x to the one half so d y is going to be one half x one half minus one is negative one half times dx and then if we rewrite it this is one over two times the square root of x now x is nine and dx is point zero two point zero two divided by two is point zero one and the square root of nine is three so it's point zero one divided by 3 and that's equal to 0.003333 repeating and so that's d y so comparing d y and delta y they're both about .00333 so they're very close to each other and so as you can see when delta x is small delta y and d y are approximately equal to each other you

consider this problem how can we estimate 2.99 raised to the fourth power now we know the answer is close to three to the fourth power three to the fourth is 81. but what's 2.99 raised to the fourth power we know it's less than 81 but how can we get a good approximation of the answer without a calculator well let's talk about it first we need to know what function is associated with this expression so f of x would equal what function all you need to do is replace 2.99 with x and you get this function x to the fourth power and then you want to pick a value for x where it's very close to 2.99 so therefore we're going to say 3. and what you need to do is write the tangent line equation at x equals three and then use that equation to approximate this value so we're going to use the point slope formula y minus y one is equal to m times x minus x one we already have x one x one is three we need to calculate y one which is going to be f of three which is three to the fourth and so that's eighty one so y one is going to be eighty one now we need to calculate the slope which we could find using the first derivative so f prime of x using the power rule that's going to be 4 x to the third power so f prime of 3 is four times three to the third power so three to the third as 27 and 27 times four well twenty times four is eighty four times seven is twenty eight 80 plus 28 is 108 so this is equal to the slope when x is string so now we have x1 y1 and the slope m so let's plug it into this equation so it's going to be y minus y 1 which is equal to m times x minus x1 now the next thing that we need to do is add 81 to both sides so we need to take this number move it to the other side so it's going to be 81 plus 108 times x minus 3. we really don't need to distribute the 108 so i'm going to leave it in this form so this is the tangent line equation at x equals 3. now what we're going to do is plug in this value replace x with 2.99 and that is going to give us the approximation of this expression so replacing x with 2.99 we have 2.99 minus 3 which is negative 0.01 now 108 times negative 0.01 you just got to move the decimal 2 units to the left that's going to be 1.08 but negative so what's 81 minus 1.08 so this is going to be 81 minus one minus point zero eight eighty one minus one is eighty and a hundred minus point zero eight is ninety two so eighty minus point zero eight is going to be seventy nine point two because you have to take away one from 80. and so this is going to be the approximation so we're saying that 2.99 to the fourth power is approximately equal to 79.92 now let's get the exact answer using the calculator let's see how close we are so the exact answer is 79.9253 so that's pretty close let's try this one estimate the square root of 9.1 so first we need to identify the function the function is going to be the square root of x and now let's find the first derivative so this is x raised to the one-half and that's going to be one-half x to the negative one-half which we can rewrite as one over 2 square root x now x we could say is 9 because 9 is close to 9.1 so now let's evaluate f of nine f of nine is going to be the square root of nine which is three so if x one is nine y one is three now we need to calculate the slope which is going to be f prime of three i mean f prime of nine i'll take that back so that's 1 over 2 square root 9. and the square root of 9 is 3 2 times 3 is 6 so it's 1 over 6. so the slope when x is nine is one over six so once you have these three things x one y one and a slope you can now write the tangent line equation so it's going to be y minus y1 is equal to m times x minus x1 so y1 is 3 m is 1 over 6. x one is nine and then let's add three to both sides so it's three plus one over six times x minus nine so now in this form we can estimate the square root of 9.1 so it's going to be 3 plus 1 over 6 times 9.1 minus 9. nine point one minus nine is point one now what is one divided by six if you're not sure about this you can use long division to convert the fraction into a decimal so let's do that so the numerator has to go on the inside six goes into one zero times so we need a decimal point let's add another zero six goes into ten one time one times six is six so six times point one is point six one minus six is four and then add another zero six goes into forty six times six times six is thirty six this gives us another four and six goes into forty six times and then you can see that it's just going to repeat so it's basically one over six is point one six repeating so we have three plus point one six repeating times point one now whenever you multiply something by 0.1 you need to move the decimal one unit to left so this is going to be 3 plus 0.016 repeating and so the estimation is going to be 3.016 repeating so the square root of 9.1 is approximately 3.016 repeating now let's get the exact answer using a calculator and this is going to be 3.016662 which these two numbers are very close so the tangent line approximation is very useful for estimating things like the square root of 9.1 or the other one 2.99 raised to the fourth power now what's your turn estimate the natural log of 1.1 without a calculator so the function is ln x and the first derivative of l and x is going to be one over x now x one is going to be a number close to one point one so the best answer to use is one because we know the natural log of one so f of one which is ln one the natural log of one is zero which means y one is zero now the first derivative when x is one that's one over one and so that is equal to the slope so m is one so now that we have x one y one and m we can now calculate well we could determine the tangent line function so it's y minus y one equals m times x minus x one so y one is zero m is one and x one is one so basically the tangent line approximation is x minus one so what we need to do is plug in 1.1 so it's going to be 1.1 minus 1 which is 0.1 so therefore we could say that the natural log of 1.1 is approximately 0.1 i'm going to put equal but approximately now let's find a real answer so go ahead and type in ln 1.1 and this is equal to 0.0953 so 0.095 and 0.1 they're pretty close they're not too far off i mean you might have a 5 difference but 0.095 can be rounded to 0.1 you

here is a question for you how can you estimate the value of 2.99 raised to the fourth power rounded to the nearest tenth place without the use of a calculator in this video we're going to talk about how to do that and we're going to confirm our answer with a calculator now this involves the use of calculus but it's not too complicated you can learn this the first thing we're going to do is replace 2.99 with a variable so we're going to choose x so we have x to the fourth power and that is going to be our function f of x now what we need to do in this problem is we need to write a linear equation that describes the behavior of this function near this value when x is 2.99 so first we're going to pick an integer value that is close to 2.99 and that's going to be 3. in order to write the linear equation that we want we need three things we need a point the x y coordinate of a point and we need the slope ideally the slope of the tangent line at the curve near this point so first we need to determine what our x value is going to be it's going to be an integer that is closest to this value and so the best thing to pick is 3. now we need to get y and the slope of the tangent line f of x is equal to y so y is going to be f of x when x is three and so that's going to be three to the fourth power three to the fourth power is equivalent to multiplying four threes three times three is 9 times 9 is 81. so now we have our y value which is 81. the next thing we need to do is calculate the slope of the tangent line and in order to do that we need to find the first derivative of the function known as f prime of x the derivative of a variable raised to a constant the derivative of x raised to the n power is going to be n times x raised to the n minus 1. so for example the derivative of x squared will be 2x to the first power the derivative of x cubed will be 3x to the second power the derivative of x to the fourth is 4x to the third power and the derivative of x to the fifth is 5x to the fourth power so this is what we need that's going to be f prime of x the derivative of x to the fourth power which we see here so now that we have f prime of x we can calculate the slope of the tangent line the derivative is a function that will tell us the slope of the tangent line at any x value now our x value is three so we need to calculate f prime of three and that's going to be four times three to the third power so this is four times three times three times three three times three is nine times three is twenty seven now four times twenty is eighty four times seven is twenty eight eighty plus 28 is 108 so that's 4 times 27 so the slope of the tangent line is equal to 108. so now we have everything that we need to write our linear equation that will approximate the curve f of x equals x to the fourth at x equals three and we're going to use the point slope formula y minus y one is equal to m times x minus x one so we have our m value x1 is 3 y1 is 81. so we're going to have y minus 81 is equal to 108 times x minus 3. now i'm going to move 81 from the left side to the right side it's negative on the left side but it's going to change to a positive value on the right side so y is equal to 108 times x minus 3 plus 81. so this equation describes the behavior of the curve x to the fourth when x is close to three so we could use that equation to estimate the y value when x is 2.99 so let's plug this in it's going to be 108 times 2.99 minus 3 plus 81. 2.99 minus 3 that's negative 0.01 now 0.1 times anything all we need to do to get the answer is move the decimal 2 units to the left so 108 times 0.01 is going to be 1.08 but it's going to be negative so what we have is negative 1.08 plus 81. let me clear away a few things so right now this is i'm going to reverse it it's 81 minus 1.08 now let's break down 1.08 into two numbers that's one and point zero eight eighty-one minus one is eighty now eighty minus point zero eight what do you think that's going to be well we can break this down into 79 plus 1 because 79 plus 1 is 80 and then minus 0.08 so what is one minus point zero eight well what is one hundred minus eight a hundred minus eight is ninety two so 1.00 minus 0.08 must be 0.92 so we have 79 plus 0.92 which is 79.92 whoops i'm not sure how that happened so we could say that 2.99 raised to the fourth power is we're going to round this to the nearest tenth so this is approximately 79.9 so let's see if our answer is accurate so we're going to use a calculator to get the exact answer or close to the exact answer so 2.99 raised to the fourth power here's what i got it's five 79.9253 eight eight zero one and my calculator stops there so 79.9 is very close to this number i mean it's the the rounded value 79.925 rounds to 79.9 so this method is acceptable so that's how you can estimate certain numbers like this if they're very close to some integer value i mean you could use it for anything but it's easier if they're close to a number like three four or five it just makes the math easier 

Transcript for: Extreme Value Theorem
in this video we're going to focus on the extreme value theorem and it says that if f is continuous on a closed interval a to b then the function f has both a minimum and a maximum on the interval so let's illustrate it so let's say if we have some graph and we have a curve on a graph and both of these are endpoints because it has to be a closed interval so the first point is a the second point is b according to the extreme value theorem there's going to be a minimum and a maximum on this interval and there is so this point represents the absolute maximum because it's the highest point on the closed interval a to b and this point here represents the absolute minimum because it is the lowest point on the interval a to b for the function f now let's go over some more examples where you need to identify the extrema on a graph here's another one so let's say if we have a graph that looks like this identify all of the extrema on this graph so let's call this a b and this point c and d so at b we have the absolute actually that is not the absolute maximum the absolute maximum is here that's the highest point on the graph it's not the end point b anymore but it still exists in the interval a to b since we have a closed interval and a is the lowest point of the graph so that's the absolute minimum but in this example we have two other things that we need to pay attention to notice that at point d this is known as a local minimum also known as a relative minimum and at c we have another relative extra so that's a local max or a relative max now notice that we can draw a horizontal tangent line at c and at d and there's something called fermat's theorem if f has a local maximum or a local minimum at some point c or it could be another letter and if f prime of c exists then f prime of c is zero so here's c and here's d so at point c we have a relative maximum and according to fermat's theorem f prime of c is going to equal zero because we do have a point that exists in a function so anytime you have a horizontal tangent line the derivative will be zero at that point so f prime of d is also zero and any time you have the first derivative function being equal to zero then those points are known as critical numbers so c and d are critical numbers of the function so anytime f prime of c is equal to zero or even if it doesn't exist you have a critical number at that point now let's look at some more examples go ahead and identify the extrema for this one let's say this is point a let's call this b and c and also let's focus on this one so let's call this point a b c and d feel free to pause the video identify all of the extreme values in this function so notice that at point c we have a absolute maximum it's the highest point but we don't have an absolute minimum and it makes sense why we don't have both because we do not have a closed interval in fact we have an open interval from a to b since we have open circles at both point a and b so notice that a appears to be the lowest point in the graph but it's not actually a point so therefore this is not an absolute minimum if it was a closed circle then it would be an absolute minimum now on the graph on the right b represents an absolute minimum because we do have a closed point at b but we don't have a closed interval because there is a break between c and d so the extreme value theorem would not apply in this example notice that there is no absolute maximum this point appears to be the highest point even though it's a whole but it's not an absolute max if it was a closed circle then it would be an absolute max so watch out for the open circles whenever you have a graph you 

Transcript for: Finding Critical Numbers
in this video we're going to focus on finding the critical numbers of a function so what are critical numbers well let me give you a visual illustration so let's say if we have this function f and it looks like this let's call this point a b c d and e so notice that at point c we have a local maximum and we also have a horizontal tangent line so at f prime of c it's equal to zero c is a critical number and the same is true for d this time we have not a local maximum but a local minimum and at d the derivative is equal to zero that is the first derivative so d and c are both critical numbers now another point that's a critical number is at point e so notice that we have a cusp it's not differentiable at this function but f of e has a value e exists in the function but because it's not differentiable f prime of e does not exist nevertheless e is still a critical number now it's important to know that a function will not exist if there's a zero in the denominator so if you have some function let's say in a fraction format if you set the numerator equal to zero you're going to have this situation a horizontal tangent line and so you'll get a critical number but if you set the denominator equal to zero then it's not differentiable at that point but it's still a critical number so let's say if this is equal to f prime of x if we set the numerator equal to x x will equal negative four so that's going to be a critical number if we set the denominator equal to zero x will equal three so these two are both critical numbers keep that in mind now let's start with this problem let's say that f of x is equal to 4x squared plus 8x find the critical numbers of the function so what we need to do is find the first derivative set it equal to 0 and solve for x so what's the derivative of 4x squared using the constant multiple rules can be 4 times the derivative of x squared which is 2x and the derivative of 8x is going to be 8 times the derivative of x which is 1. so that's we have 4 times 2x which is 8x so 8x plus 8. so we need to set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x so let's factor out an eight if we do so we're going to get x plus one dividing both sides by eight zero is equal to x plus one so x is equal to negative one so this is the critical number of the function f prime of negative one is equal to zero now let's work on another example let's say if we have this function f of x is equal to 2 x cubed minus 15 x squared plus 36 x plus 10. if you want to try this problem feel free to pause the video so go ahead and find the first derivative set it equal to zero and solve for x the derivative of 2 x cubed is going to be 2 times the derivative of x cubed which is 3x squared the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of x is one and the derivative of a constant is zero so f prime of x is equal to six x squared fifteen times two is thirty and then plus thirty six now we're gonna replace f prime of x with zero and now let's solve for x so we need to factor this expression notice that every coefficient is divisible by six so let's take out the gcf which is 6. 6x squared divided by 6 is x squared negative 30x divided by 6 is negative 5x 36 divided by 6 is 6. so now we need to factor this trinomial what two numbers multiply to six but add to negative five two times three is six but negative two plus negative three adds up to negative five so it's going to be x minus two times x minus three so now we need to set each factor equal to zero and so we're going to get two answers two and positive three so we have two critical numbers in this particular example here's another one that you can try let's say that f of x is equal to four x raised to the one third minus eight x raised to the four thirds power now let's use the power rule to find the first derivative so the derivative of x to the one-third is going to be one-third x and then it's going to be one-third minus one now one is the same as three over three and one minus three is negative two so this is going to be one third x to the negative two thirds power and then minus eight times the derivative of x to the four thirds so using the power rule it's four thirds x raised to the four over three minus one which is four over three minus three over three and that becomes one over three now for this particular type of problem what you need to do right now is take out the gcf you need to factor it out so from both terms what is the greatest common factor well both terms contain a four and a three so we can take out four thirds how many x variables can we take out so let's say if we have x squared plus x to the fifth power if you have to factor this expression what would be the gcf of these two terms it's going to be the lowest of the two numbers so it's going to be x squared and you'll get 1 plus x cubed now the way you get these numbers is you need to divide you divide x squared by x squared that gives you 1. and for the second one if you take x to the fifth power divided by x squared that will give you x cubed well we'll need to apply the same principle here so which of these two exponents is lower in value negative two-thirds or one-third compare it on a number line the numbers on the left are lower than the numbers on the right so negative numbers are lower than positive numbers on a number line so we're going to take out x raised to the negative two thirds now if you take this term and divide it by that term what will it give you because they're exactly the same it's going to be one and if you take this term and divide it by that term what will you get the four thirds will cancel so it's going to leave behind negative eight and then if you divide x to the one third by x to the minus two thirds you need to subtract so it's going to be one over three minus negative two over three which is basically one over three plus two over 3 which is 3 over 3 and 3 divided by 3 is 1 so that's simply just x which works out nicely so now this x i'm going to bring it to the bottom so that we can convert the negative exponent into a positive one and so we now have four times one minus eight x divided by three x raised to the two thirds so that's the first derivative now recall that to find a critical number f prime of c has to equal to zero or f prime of c does not exist or is equal to one over zero so whenever you have a fraction to find a horizontal tangent line or the first critical number set the numerator equal to zero and for the critical numbers where it's not differentiable set the denominator equal to zero that's what we're going to do in this example anytime you have a fraction so if we set the numerator equal to zero we really don't need to worry about the four because if you divide both sides by four zero over four is zero so we just gotta set one minus eight x equal to zero so if we add eight x to both sides one is equal to 8x and then if we divide by 8 the first critical number is 1 over 8. now let's determine the next critical number so let's set the denominator equal to zero so if we divide both sides by three zero divided by three is still zero and so we can clearly see that x has to be zero if you raise both sides to the three over two zero raised to the three over two is zero and here the twos will cancel the threes will cancel so x is equal to zero so there's two critical numbers for this particular problem zero and one divided by eight here's another example let's say f of x is equal to the absolute value of five x plus eight identify the critical numbers in that function now this is just a generic shape for an absolute value function the absolute value of x looks like this and the critical number occurs right at the middle because the function is not differentiable at that point notice that for this particular function the slope changes from negative one to positive one instantly and so you don't know what the slope is at this point it's not differentiable so anytime you have an absolute value function or if the curve changes abruptly you have a critical number f prime of c does not exist at that point nevertheless it's still a critical number at that point and to find it all you need to do is set the inside equal to zero and so for this graph the critical number is x equals zero so what about the example that we have the absolute value of five x plus eight all we need to do is set five x plus eight equal to zero subtracting both sides by eight we have five x is equal to negative eight and then we need to divide by five so the critical number is negative eight over five so if you were to graph that particular function around negative one point six is where the y value will be equal to zero and so we have a graph that looks like this the slope is five so it should be rising quickly so notice that this point is the critical number at x equals negative eight over five here's another problem let's say that f of x is equal to x times the square root of 9 minus x go ahead and find the first derivative and set it equal to 0 and determine the critical numbers so in this example to differentiate it we need to use the product rule and just as a reminder the derivative of f times g is going to be the derivative of the first part f prime times the second g plus the first f times the derivative of the second g prime so in this case we can say that f is x and g is the square root of nine minus x but before we differentiate it we need to rewrite it as x times nine minus x raised to the one half so now let's begin so the derivative of the first part x is one times the second plus the first part times the derivative of the second which is going to be if you use the power rule and the chain rule it's going to be one half keep the inside the same and then subtract the exponent by one one half minus one is negative one half and then differentiate the inside function the derivative of nine minus x is negative one so now like before we need to factor out the gcf the only thing that we could take out is nine minus x and negative one half is less than one half so the gcf is going to be nine minus x raised to the negative one half now one half minus negative one half if you divide those two terms that's going to be one half plus one half so the first one is going to be 9 minus x raised to the 1 or simply just 9 minus x and then if we divide this term by this one these two will cancel leaving behind negative one-half x to make the negative exponent positive i'm going to move this to the denominator so on top we have 9 minus x minus 1 half x and on the bottom nine minus x raised to the positive one half so what is negative x minus one half negative one minus one half negative one is the same as negative two over two and negative two minus one is negative three so it's negative three over two so right now we have nine minus three over two x divided by i'm to rewrite this back into its radical form the square root of 9 minus x now i want to get rid of this fraction so what i'm going to do is multiply the top and the bottom by 2. so f prime of x is equal to nine times two which is eighteen three over two times two is three so this is gonna be negative three x and on the bottom 2 times the square root of 9 minus x now at this point we need to set the numerator equal to 0 so 18 minus three x is equal to zero adding three x to both sides eighteen is equal to three x and if we divide by three the first critical number x is equal to six now for the second critical number we need to set the denominator equal to zero so if we divide both sides by two zero minus zero divided by two is zero and then if we that should not be a two that should be zero if we square both sides zero squared is zero and then we need to add x to both sides so we can see that x is equal to nine so the critical numbers are six and nine now let's work on one last problem let's say that f of x is equal to sine squared x plus cosine so we have a trigonometric function go ahead and find the first derivative set it equal to zero and find all the critical numbers now the first thing i'm going to do is rewrite this function because i'm going to have to use the chain rule on sine squared x i'm going to write it like this sine x squared so now let's determine the first derivative oh by the way the function is restricted from zero to two pi because sine and cosine are periodic functions and they go on forever so you may want to add that to the problem so if you want to try it feel free to pause the video and work on it now let's use the chain rule so i'm going to move the two to the front according to the power rule keep the inside function the same subtract the exponent by one two minus one is one and then take the derivative of the inside function the derivative of sine is cosine now we need to differentiate cosine the derivative of cosine is negative sine now let's set the first derivative equal to zero and we need to factor the gcf which is sine so if we take out sine x this term divided by that one the signs will cancel leaving behind two cosine x and if we take the negative sign divided by positive sign that will give us negative one now we need to set each factor equal to zero so on the right side we need to add one to both sides so we can see that two cosine x is equal to one and then if we divide both sides by two cosine x is one half now when is sine x equal to zero sine of zero is zero sine of pi is zero and sine of two pi is zero however x does not include zero or two pi so we need to get rid of those two answers so we only have one answer in the interval and that's pi so far now when is cosine positive one half cosine is positive in quadrants one and four cosine 30 is equal to the square root of three over two but cosine 60 is one half so therefore x is going to be 60 degrees which is the same as pi over 3. pi is 180 180 over 3 is 60. and in quadrant 4 it's going to be 5 pi over 3 which is 300 degrees that has a reference angle of 60 in quadrant 4 because 360 minus 300 is 60. so if you need to review your trigonometry you can look up my new trigonometry playlists you can find it in my channel and you can review this stuff if you need to so these are the answers pi over 3 pi and 5 pi over 3 all of which are in this interval so that's it for this video now you know how to find the critical numbers of a function so find the first derivative set it equal to zero and solve for x you 

Transcript for: Finding Local Maximum and Minimum Values of a Function - Relative Extrema
in this video we're going to focus on identifying the local maximum and minimum values of the function so let's say if we have a generic shape here we have a local maximum and at this point it's a local minimum so at these extreme values you're always going to have a horizontal tangent line so the derivative is going to equal zero at that point so let's say if we have this function f of x and it's equal to x squared minus four x in order to identify the location of the local maximum and minimum values also known as the relative maximum and minimum values we need to find the first derivative set it equal to 0 and solve for x and that's going to give us the critical numbers and then we could use a sign chart to determine if we have a local max or a local min at that particular critical number so let's go ahead and begin so let's start with the first derivative the derivative of x squared is two x and the derivative of x is one so we have two x minus four and let's set that equal to zero so if we add 4 to both sides 2x will equal 4 and then if we divide by 2 this will give us the first critical number x is equal to 2 since f prime of 2 is equal to 0. so 2 is the critical number now what you want to do at this point is you want to make a number line and place the critical number in the number line now i'm going to write the factored form of the first derivative and that is two times x minus two so let's say if we were to plug in a number greater than two like three will the first derivative be positive or negative three minus two is positive one so it's going to be positive if we plug in a number less than two like one one minus two is negative so if the derivative changes from negative to positive do we have a local max or a local min when the first derivative is negative the function is decreasing when it's positive it's increasing so therefore this is the shape of a local min so we have a local minimum at x equals 2. now to actually find the local minimum value we need to find the y-coordinate of the function so let's evaluate f of two so that's going to be two squared minus four times two two squared is four four times two is eight four minus eight is negative four so the local minimum value is negative four if you want to write your answer as an ordered pair it's going to be two comma negative four so the local minimum is located at x equals two and the minimum value is negative 4. now let's try another problem so let's say that f of x is equal to 2x cubed plus 3x squared minus 12x go ahead and identify all of the relative extrema in this example so let's begin by finding the first derivative the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of x is one so this is equal to 6x squared plus 6x minus 12. and we need to set the first derivative equal to zero now let's factor first let's take out the gcf which is six six x squared divided by six is x squared six x divided by six is x or 1x negative 12 divided by 6 is negative 2. so now we need to factor this trinomial when the leading coefficient is 1. so we need to find two numbers that multiply to the constant term negative two but add to the middle coefficient one so this is going to be negative two and one negative two times one is negative two but negative two plus 1 is and this should be positive 2 negative 1. i'll take that back because 2 and negative 1 adds up to a positive 1 but 2 times negative 1 is negative 2. so when we factor it's going to be x plus 2 times x minus 1. now we need to set each factor equal to 0. so x plus 2 is equal to 0 and x minus 1 is equal to 0. so we have negative 2 and 1 as the critical numbers of the function so now at this point we need to create a number line so we're going to place negative 2 to the left of 1 and we need to use the factor form of the first derivative to produce the sign chart so let's pick a number that's greater than one let's try two two plus two is positive two minus one is also positive a positive number times a positive number will give us a positive result now there's something that i want you to pay attention to notice that the exponents of each factor also known as the multiplicity is one whenever the multiplicity is an odd number the sign will change if it's even it will remain the same so for this particular critical number we have an odd multiplicity therefore this should be negative it's going to change from positive to negative and for this factor it's also odd so it's going to change from negative to positive and we could test it so if we plug in a number between negative two and one like zero we should get a negative result for the first derivative zero plus two is positive and zero minus one is negative a positive number times a negative number will give us a negative result now let's confirm this one as well so let's try negative three negative three plus two that's negative one and negative three minus one is negative four two negative numbers multiplied to each other will give us a positive result now which critical number is the relative maximum and which one is the relative minimum so negative two is that a relative max or a relative min well the slope changes from positive to negative so on the left side of negative 2 the function is increasing and on the right side it's decreasing so that is a relative maximum so we have a maximum at negative 2. now for the next one the slope is negative so it's the function is decreasing and then the slope is positive now it's increasing so at 1 we have a relative minimum now the last thing that you may need to do is you may need to express your answer as an ordered pair so let's do that for this example but you don't always have to do it for these types of problems it depends on what the problem is asking for so let's determine y when x is one so it's going to be two times one raised to the third power plus three times one squared minus twelve times one so that's gonna be two plus three minus twelve two plus three is five five minus twelve is negative seven so we have the ordered pair one negative seven now for the second one let's replace x with negative two negative two to the third power is negative eight negative two squared is positive four and negative twelve times negative two is twenty-four now two times negative eight is negative sixteen three times four is twelve and negative sixteen plus twelve that's negative four negative four plus twenty four is twenty so we have a local max at negative two comma twenty and so that's it for this problem so now you know how to identify the ordered pairs for the local maximum and the local minimum and we can clearly see that 20 is a lot higher than negative 7. now let's work on one final problem so let's say that f of x is three x to the fourth power minus sixteen x cubed plus twenty four x squared so go ahead and identify the location of any relative extreme values you don't have to find the y coordinates for this problem just the x coordinates so let's start by determining the first derivative so the derivative of x to the fourth is 4x cubed and the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of x squared is 2x so the first derivative is going to be 3 times 4 which is 12 16 times 3 that's 48 24 times 2 is 48 now let's set the first derivative equal to zero and now let's take out the gcf the greatest common factor is going to be 12x 12x cubed divided by 12x that's going to be x squared and negative 48 x squared divided by 12x that's going to be negative 4x and 48 x divided by 12x that's going to be four so now what two numbers multiply to four but add to negative four so this is going to be negative two and negative two negative two plus negative two is negative four but negative two times negative two is positive four so we have x minus two times x minus two so we can rewrite this as 12x times x minus 2 squared now let's set each factor equal to zero so if we set 12x equal to zero and if we divide both sides by 12 x is zero and if we set x minus two squared equal to zero and take the square root of both sides we're gonna have x minus two is equal to the square root of zero is zero and if we add two x is two so the critical numbers are zero and two so now let's make the sign chart let's pick a number that's greater than two let's try three twelve times three is positive three minus two is positive now notice that we have an odd multiplicity for 12x but an even multiplicity for x minus two and when it's even the sign will remain the same but when it's odd it's gonna change so it's gonna change across zero but stay the same across two now let's confirm it so let's pick a number between zero and two let's try one twelve times one is positive one minus two is negative but once you square it it becomes positive so we get a positive result now let's try a negative one 12 times negative 1 is negative negative 1 minus 2 is negative 3 when you square it becomes positive 9 so you have a positive number times a negative number and that will give you a negative result so now the last thing we need to determine is which one is the maximum and which one is a minimum now going from zero to two it's a decrease and then it's increasing so we have a minimum at zero now at two it doesn't change sign so it's neither a minimum or a maximum so the function is probably increasing and then increasing again or it could be increasing this way and then increasing again that way either case none of these represents a minimum or maximum so you can have this shape or you could have that shape so all we have is a minimum at x equals zero you 

Transcript for: Fermat's Theorem - Application of Derivatives - Calculus 1
let's talk about firat theorem fats theorem states that if F ofx has a local maximum or minimum at C and if fime of C exists then frime of C is equal to zero so let's focus on the graph on the left at this point we have a local maximum so the first part checks out now let's look at the second part at Point C does frpr of C exists we know the function is continuous at Point C there's no jumps or breaks in the graph but is it differentiable if the graph has a smooth turn as opposed to a sharp turn it's going to be differentiable meaning you could take the the derivative of this function and get a value for it so the fact that it's differentiable at Point C that means that fime of C exists at this point now according to Fat's theorem if these conditions are met if F ofx has a local maximum at Point C and if it's differentiable that means if fim of C exists at that point then the conclusion is that the derivative at that point will be zero in other words the slope of the tangent line frpr of C will be equal to zero and the slope of any horizontal line will always be zero so we could see the validity of that statement now let's look at the graph on the right side so at Point C we have a local minimum so the first part checks out now the next part does frime of C exists at Point C what would you say we know it's continuous at Point C there's no jumps or points of discontinuity there but is it differentiable at Point C the answer is no it's not differentiable at Point C we don't have a smooth turn at this point we have a sharp turn here the slope is negative because the function is decreasing and it's becoming more negative then instantaneously the slope changes to a positive value so imagine let's put some numbers here let's say let's extend the graph a little so here we have a horizontal tangent the slope might be zero over here the slope might be 1 over here it's steeper so it might be -2 over here it would be positive2 because it's going up now this will be positive 1 this would be zero so to change from -2 to two without Crossing zero that's not possible and so you can see that this is almost forming a vertical tangent so because we have this sharp turn it's not differentiable at this point so since frime of C does not exist then for the graph on the right side frime of C does not equal zero if you try to find the derivative at this point it doesn't exist because it's not differential at Point C so the basic idea behind firat theorem is that if a function has a local Max or minimum like we have here and if it's differentiable or if frime of C exists at that point then the slope of the tangent line at those points will be equal to zero or in other words frime of C will be equal to zero so that's the basic idea behind for mat theem for those of you who are curious about it so that's going to be basically it for this video now for those of you who want more practice problems on derivatives applications of derivatives even limits or how to calculate the value of a definite integral or just basic integration overall feel free to check out the links in the description section below this video I'm going to be posting more content there for those of you who want extra problems on related topics so feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance 

Transcript for: Finding Absolute Maximum and Minimum Values - Absolute Extrema
in this lesson we're going to focus on identifying the location of the absolute maximums and minimums of a function so let's start with a graph so you can visually see it and let's say if we have a function that looks like this so let's call this point a point B C and D identify the location of any absolute and relative extrema of this particular graph so the absolute maximum is the highest point on a graph and the absolute minimum is the lowest point now this peak right here it's not the highest point but it's the highest point in this local area so it's called a local Max or a relative maximum and this point is a relative or a local minimum now to identify the location of the absolute extrema you simply have to compare the Y values so you may need to make a data table to do so to identify the relative extrema you need to identify the locations where the slope is 0 since we have a horizontal tangent line f prime of B will be equal to 0 and F prime of C will also be equal to 0 so you need to use the first derivative to find the location of any relative extrema now let's work on a practice problem so let's say that f of X is equal to x squared minus 4x plus 9 and identify any absolute and relative extreme values of the function anywhere in the interval between 1 and 4 so the first thing I would recommend doing is identifying the critical points that's where the first derivative is equal to 0 at those locations you could find any relative extrema values like a relative min or max the derivative of x squared is 2x the derivative of negative 4x is negative 4 and the derivative of a constant is 0 so let's set this equal to 0 now let's take out a 2 so this is going to be X minus 2 if we divide both sides by 2 and 0 is equal to X minus 2 and if we add 2x is equal to 2 so we have 2 as the critical number and we need to identify if this is going to be a relative maximum or a relative minimum so we need to create a sign chart so let's make a number line now we need to determine what the slope is going to be to the left and to the right of 2 so let's pick a number that's greater than 2 let's try 3 if we plug in 3 into the first derivative 3 minus 2 is positive so the result will be positive if we plug in a number that's less than 2 like 1 into the first derivative 1 minus 2 will be negative and then if we multiply that by 2 that will give you a negative result so notice that the slope changes from negative to positive across the critical point so a to do we have a relative and Maxima or a relative minimum when a slope is negative the function is decreasing and when it's positive the function is increasing and so this is a minimum so we have a relative minimum at x equals 2 so now let's move on to the absolute extreme values so once you have all of the critical points make a table now on the table you want to put the endpoints of the interval so run in 4 and then in between that any critical numbers that you have now we need to determine the Y values for each of these x-values so we need to plug in the values into this function to get one so let's start with one F of one is going to be 1 squared minus 4 times 1 plus 9 so this is 1 minus 4 plus 9 1 plus 9 is 10 10 minus 4 is 6 so f of 1 is equal to 6 now let's evaluate the function when X is 2 so this is 2 squared minus 4 times 2 plus 9 2 squared is 4 4 times 2 is 8 4 minus 8 is negative 4 negative 4 plus 9 is 5 now let's evaluate the function when X is 4 4 squared is 16 4 times 4 is the same thing 16 minus 16 is 0 0 plus 9 is 9 so f of 4 is equal to 9 so notice that 9 is the highest Y value therefore 9 is the absolute maximum value of the function 5 is the absolute minimum value because 5 is less than 6 and 9 in addition it's also the relative minimum so it's both the absolute minimum and the relative minimum on the interval of 1 to 4 and so that's how you could find the absolute extreme values of the function as well as the relative extreme values now let's work on another problem so let's use a different function so f of X will be equal to let's say 4 X cubed minus 30 9 x squared plus 90 X +2 so identify all of the absolute and relative extreme values of the function on the interval 1 to 6 so feel free to pause the video if you want to try this problem so let's begin by finding the critical numbers of the function so we need to find the first derivative in order to do that the derivative of X cube is 3x squared and the derivative of x squared is 2x the derivative of X is 1 and the derivative of a constant is 0 so f prime of X is going to equal 4 times 3 which is 12 so that's 12x squared 39 times 2 is 78 and then plus 90 so let's set the first derivative equal to 0 now notice that all of the coefficients are even so we can divide everything by 2 if we do so if we divide both sides by 2 on the left 0 divided by 2 is 0 on the right half of 12 is 6 half of 78 is 39 and half of 90 is 45 now 639 and 45 they are divisible by 3 so let's divide everything by 3 so this is going to be 0 and then 6 divided by 3 is 2 39 divided by 3 is 13 45 divided by 3 is 15 so now let's factor the expression that we have by the way if you want the first derivative in its factored form we divided everything by 6 so you can write it like this if you want to so how can we factor 2x squared minus 13x plus 15 how can we do that so first we need to multiply the leading coefficient by the constant term you need to do that anytime this number is anything but 1/2 times 15 is 30 now we need to find two numbers that multiply to 30 but add to the middle coefficient of negative 13 so this is going to be 10 and 3 both of which are negative because negative 10 times negative 3 is positive 30 but negative 10 plus negative 3 adds up to negative 13 so what we're going to do is replace the middle term negative 13x with negative 10x minus 3x and then we need to factor by grouping so take out the GCF in the first two terms the greatest common factor is 2x 2x squared divided by 2x is X negative 10x divided by 2x is negative 5 in the last two terms take out the greatest common factor which is going to be negative 3 negative 3x divided by negative 3 is X positive 15 divided by negative 3 and it's negative 5 so now we need to factor out X minus 5 so this term divided by X minus five these two will cancel leaving behind 2x and if we take this term divided by X minus five these will cancel giving us negative three so this is the first derivative in its factored form now we need to set each factor equal to zero so FLE set X minus 5 equal to zero and add 5 to both sides this is the first critical number X is equal to 5 and then let's set the other factor to X minus 3 equal to 0 so add 3 to both sides and then divide by 2 so the second critical point is 3 over 2 so now we need to make a sign chart to determine which of those critical points represent the relative maximum and which one is the relative minimum 3 over 2 comes before 5 so let's pick a number that's greater than 5 and then you should rewrite this expression so let's try 6 if we plug in 6 we'll the first derivative be positive or negative 6 minus 5 is positive 2 times 6 minus 3 is also positive so if we multiply two positive numbers this will give us a positive result now notice that for each factor we have an odd exponent that means the signs will change across each critical number so if you pick a number between one point five and five it's going to be negative so let's try 2 2 times 2 minus 3 that's positive that's equal to positive 1 2 minus 5 is negative a negative number times a positive number will give us a negative ezel and if we pick something that's a less than 2 we have a 2 like zero that will be positive zero minus 5 is negative two times zero minus 3 is also negative if you multiply two negative numbers that will give you a positive result now which of these critical numbers represents a maximum and which one is a minimum well let's focus on 3 over 2 the function is increasing and then it's decreasing so that represents a maximum and for five its decrease in first and then is increasing so that's a minimum so now let's make a table so let's put the endpoints so we have one and six and make sure that the critical numbers are in this interval if they're not you can't use them so 3 over 2 is 1 point 5 that's between 1 and 6 and so it's 5 now let's identify the y-values for each of the X values so let's start with one this is going to be 4 minus 39 plus 90 plus 2 and I'm going to use the calculator for this one so I got 57 when X is 1 now when X is 3 over 2 or 1.5 this is going to be 4 times 1.5 to the third power minus 39 times 1.5 squared + 90 times 1.5 plus 2 so hopefully you're allowed to use calculators on a test because this will take a while we could do it without a calculator but I'm not gonna do it in this video so I got as the decimal 60 2.75 now for F of five I'm just going to type it in I got negative 23 and then for F of 6 I got two now which of these points represent the absolute maximum in this interval sixty two point seven five is the highest value so this is the absolute maximum what about the absolute minimum negative twenty three is the lowest Y value listed so five comma negative twenty-three that's the absolute minimum so the absolute minimum of the function is located at x equals five but the absolute minimum value that represents the y-coordinate the value is negative twenty three so typically the location is associated with the x coordinate but the value is associated with the y coordinate now we said that three over two was also the relative maximum it was a critical number and five was a relative minimum so sometimes the endpoints they may be an absolute Max or an absolute minimum you don't know you have to check it other times the absolute max can be the relative Max and the absolute minimum can be the relative minimum so you need to make the table make sure you put the endpoints of the closed interval and their critical points in the table and then just compare the y-values so that's it for this video 

Transcript for: Application of Derivatives - Formulas and Notes - Calculus Study Guide Review
in this video I'm going to go over some formulas you need to know if you're studying the application of derivatives so the first thing you need to be able to do is calculate the average rate of change the average rate of change is basically the slope of the secant line a secant line is a line that touches the curve at two points so this is the average rate of change form it's F of B minus F of A over B minus a so let's say if you have a curve that looks like this this line will be a secant line because it touches the curve at two points the first point at which it touches the curve that is point a the second point is point B so this is the average rate of change formula now sometimes you need to calculate the instantaneous rate of change the instantaneous rate of change is basically evaluating the derivative at some point this could be Point C the instantaneous rate of change is equal to the slope of the tangent line so at this point at some point C the slope of the tangent line will equal the slope of the secant line and that's the basic idea behind the mean value theorem so here's the basic definition for the mean value theorem if f ofx is continuous on the closed interval ab and if it's differentiable on the open interval AB then there is some number c in the interval AB or between a which we could see C is between a b such that fime of C is equal to F of B minus F of A over B minus a so that's the basic idea behind the mean value theorem which I'm going to abbreviate mvt so for the main value theorem as you could see the slope of the secant line and the slope of the tangent line they're the same at this point the average rate of change formula gives you the slope of the secant line and the instantaneous rate of change will give you the slope of the tangent line but when dealing with the mean value theorem those two will equal each other now the next theorem we need to be familiar with is rolls theorem if f ofx is continuous on the closed interval ab and differentiable on the open interval ab and if F of a is equal to F of B if these three conditions are met then there's going to be some number c in the open interval a where frime of C is equal to Z so here's a good example of this let's say we have a graph that looks like this and let's say here this is a and this is B notice that these A and B have the same y value so this is f of B and and this is f of a because they have the same yvalue they are equal to each other so if the end points of an interval are equal at some point between A and B there's going to be a horizontal tangent and at that horizontal tangent frime of C will be zero so C is basically the intercept of the curve and the horizontal tangent and the derivative at that point will be zero so that's the basic idea behind rolles theor by the way for those of you who want all of these formulas uh you could find it in the formula sheet in the description section below now if you need to calculate average velocity you can use the average rate of change formula so it's s of B minus s of A over B minus a so if you want to find the average velocity for the closed interval a you could use that formula so s represents position A and B will be specific time values on a position time graph because velocity is average velocity well velocity is displacement over time and displacement is the change in position so SB minus sa that's the displacement now the average acceleration it's going to be the change in velocity divided by the change in time so you can also use the average rate of change formula but instead of having the position function on the top you're going to have the Velocity function on the top so that's how you can calculate average velocity and average acceleration on the closed interval AB now if you wish to calculate the instantaneous velocity it's the derivative of the position function and if you wish to calculate instantaneous acceleration it's the derivative of the Velocity function so those are some additional formulas that you need to know if you ever need to find critical points you need to find the first derivative set it equal to zero and solve for x x is going to be your C value if you need to find critical points a critical point can also occur if frpr of C doesn't exists that's also that can also be a critical point so in that case you would look for a vertical tangent now here's some other things you want to know f ofx is increasing whenever the first derivative is greater than zero or basically when it's positive f ofx is decreasing whenever the first derivative is less than zero or when it's negative and F ofx the function is going to be constant if the first derivative is equal to zero which is basically where you have a horizontal tangent now the function is concave up that is f is cave up when the second derivative is greater than zero or positive f is concave down when the second derivative is less than zero or negative so anytime the second derivative is positive f is concave up if the second derivative is negative if or less than zero f is concave down so if we had a shape that looks like this we could see this one has the up upward u shape this part is concave up this one has the downward U shape so uh that is concave down at some point the concavity changes from up to down and that's going to be the midpoint between uh the local minimum and the local maximum so at this point when the concavity changes that is the inflection point so notice that the second derivative changes at that point so here the second derivative is positive because it's concave up so I'm just going to highlight that part in red where it's concave up and then here it's concave down so that's when the second derivative is negative so when the second derivative changes from positive to negative it has to cross zero so at the inflection point the second derivative is equal to Z Z so that's how you could find the inflection point if you if you want to find a critical point you would set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x and your x value will be your C value if you want to find the inflection point you would find a second derivative set it equal to zero solve for x however you just need to make sure the concavity changes so you may need to use a number line to check if it changes sign so let me give you an example of that so let's say the second derivative is zero when X is 2 and five and let's say this is positive this is negative this is negative so since we're dealing with the second derivative here it's concave up concave down concave down this would be an inflection point because the concavity changes even though the second derivative is zero here now the second derivative is zero at five as well however the concavity does not change so this is not an inflection point so you got to check the sign to make sure that it changes when F Prime is zero if it doesn't change then you're not dealing with a an inflection point so to give you an example of that here it's so here it's concave up then it's concave down let's see and then it could be like this so I'm going to highlight this part in red is concave up and then concave down but notice this part is also concave down so here where it's green the second derivative can be zero but here it's concave down second derivative is zero and then it's concave down again so this will typically be considered a saddle point as opposed to an inflection point now there are some other formulas associated with the application of derivatives I'm going to post those other formulas in the formula sheet so if you want the rest of the notes that's associated with this video feel free to check out that formula sheet down in the links below so that's going to be the end of this video thanks again for watching and feel free to check out my other videos and my playlists at 

Transcript for: Rolle's Theorem
in this video we're gonna focus on a roll stir and we're gonna go over some example problems associated with it so what is rolle's theorem what's the main idea behind it there are three conditions that must be met so let's say if we have a function f of X this function has to be continuous on the closed interval a B and it has to be differentiable on the open interval a B and also f of a must equal F of B if these three conditions are met then we have this particular conclusion there's gonna be some number C such that F prime of C is zero so basically there's gonna be a horizontal tangent at some point C between a and B so let's draw a picture that illustrates this so let's say if we have a graph that looks like this so is the function continuous on the closed interval what would you say yes it is there's no holes no vertical asymptotes no jumps in that curve now is the function differentiable on the open interval a B yes it is notice that we have a nice smooth curve there's no sharp terms no jumps nothing like that now there's F of a equal F of B what would you say it's the third condition met now notice that F of a and F of B they have the same Y value so therefore they're equal to each other if these three conditions are met then there's gonna be a horizontal tangent somewhere between a and B and we can see where it is it's at at this point so that's Point C and that Point C we can see that the slope of the horizontal tangent is zero so thus f prime of C is equal to zero and that's the main idea behind Rolle's Theorem so let me give you another example another graphical example so the question is can roll steering be applied for this particular function let's say this is a and this is B so is it continuous on the closed interval a B yes it is is it the French herbal on the open interval a B no it's not notice that let's assume that this is Point C here from A to C notice that the curve is going up so the slope is positive and then instantly it's going down the slope is negative so anytime you have a sharp curve where the slope changes instantaneously at this point that means that it's not differentiable at that point you cannot evaluate the first derivative at that point so therefore it's not the French pole on the open interval so Rolle's Theorem will not apply as you can see between a and B there's no point C where we have a horizontal tangent it appears as if we have a vertical tangent at the cusp but no horizontal tangent even though f of a is equal to f of B in this example because the second condition is not met rolster cannot be applied in that example now let's say that f of X is equal to x squared minus 5x plus 3 go ahead and determine if Rolle's Theorem can be applied on the interval 0 to 5 so we have this basically polynomial function it's specifically a quadratic function and all types of polynomial functions are continuous everywhere so we know that it's going to be continuous on the closed interval a B and polynomial functions are differentiable there's no vertical asymptotes or cusps or anything like that now the only thing we need to determine is f of ayyyy equal to f of B so a is 0 and B is 5 so let's calculate F of 0 so it's gonna be 0 squared minus 5 times 0 plus 3 and so this is gonna give you 3 and then F of 5 is gonna be 5 squared minus 5 times 5 plus 3 5 squared is 25 5 times 5 is 25 25 minus 25 is 0 plus 3 that will give us 3 again so notice that F of a equals F of B and we have a continuous function on a closed interval a B and it's differentiable everywhere so Rolle's Theorem can be applied now to find C we need to find the first derivative set it equal to zero so basically we're finding the critical numbers of the function so let's determine the first derivative F prime the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of negative 5 X is negative 5 so let's set it equal to zero if we add 5 to both sides we can see that 2x is equal to 5 divided both sides by 2 we get X is 5 over 2 so C is 5 over 2 and 5 divided by 2 is 2.5 and that's within the interval 0 to 5 so this is the value of C that satisfies the rows theorem now let's consider another example so let's say that f of X is equal to sine X on the interval 0 to 2pi so go ahead and find all number C in this interval that satisfies rolster so let's draw our graph sine varies between 1 and negative 1 it's a sinusoidal function it's periodic and so it repeats itself so that's from 0 to 2pi and another cycle will take us to 4 pi and it's just going to keep on going so therefore we have a continuous function there's no breaks in the graph no jumps it's differentiable everywhere there's only smooth curves there's no sharp turns and so all we need to determine is f of a equal to f of b let's see if that's true so a is 0 B is 2pi so f of 0 that's going to be sine of 0 and sine of 0 is 0 f of 2 pi that's sine of 2pi which is also equal to 0 so therefore F of a equals F of B so Rose theorem can be applied and we could see it's gonna be applied here and here keep in mind this point is 2pi so there's two answers between 0 and 2pi if you can guess what they are what will you say well notice that this point is PI so here this has to be 1/2 of pi and this is going to be 3 times 1/2 of Pi or 3 PI over 2 now let's confirm to see if those answers are correct PI over 2 and 3 PI over 2 so let's find the first derivative the first derivative of sine X is cosine X and we need to set it equal to 0 now cosine PI over 2 is equal to 0 and cosine 3 PI over 2 is equal to 0 and PI over 2 and 3 privates you are in Davone and so we can see that scene can be PI over 2 or 3 PI over 2 so you can look at the graph and determine the answers visually or you can find it from the first derivative so Rolle's Theorem can be applied for sine X now what about this example let's say if f of X is equal to X raised to the 2/3 + 1 on the interval negative 4 - 4 can we apply Rolle's Theorem so this particular function on that interval well let's find out X to the 2/3 is a graph that looks like this now I spend shifted up one unit so it's not gonna start at the origin but it's gonna start at one so this is just a generic shape of the graph just by looking at it we know that roll stem will not be applied to it because we have a cusp notice that we have a sharp turn at x equals zero which is in this interval so therefore we can say that it's not differentiable on the open interval a B so therefore we cannot apply rolls Dern and based on a shape of the graph you could see that we really don't have a horizontal tangent between negative 4 to 4 it looks like this part is horizontal but it's not it's always increasing towards the right and towards the left as you go from left to right on the left side is really decreasing so there's really no horizontal asymptote for that particular graph let's work on this example let's say that f of X is equal to x times the square root of 4 minus x over the interval 0 to 4 so can we apply rolster so is the function continuous and is it differentiable if we were to graph it this function would look something like this and this is just a rough sketch so this function is continuous between 0 & 4 and it's differentiable there's no sharp turns this is really a smooth curve so it satisfies the first two conditions of rolster and let's see if f of a is equal to f of B so f of 0 is going to be 0 times the square root of 4 minus 0 0 times anything is 0 and f of 4 it's gonna be 4 times square root of 4 minus 4 which is 0 and so this whole thing is 0 therefore we can see that F of a and F of B they are both equal to each other there are the x-intercepts of the function so Rolle's Theorem can be applied and if we go back to the graph that I drew earlier you can see that there's gonna be a horizontal tangent between 0 & 4 and so Rolle's Theorem definitely can be applied for this particular example so let's find the first derivative so we need to use the product rule and just to review let's say if we have F times G and we wish to differentiate it it's the derivative of the first part times a second plus the first part times the derivative of the second now it's wise to rewrite f as x times four minus X to the one-half so the derivative of the first part which is X that's going to be 1 times the second so we're not going to change that plus the first times the derivative of the second so we need to use the chain rule for this expression so move the exponent to the front keep the inside function the same subtract the exponent by one 1/2 minus one is negative 1/2 and then differentiate the inside function the derivative of 4 minus X is negative 1 now we need to factor out the greatest common factor which is 4 minus X to the negative 1/2 so let's go ahead and take that out when you factor the GCF you need to divide it if you want to find out what comes on the inside so if we take this term divided by this we need to subtract the exponents so it's going to be 1/2 the top 1 minus the bottom one which is negative 1/2 so the two negative signs become positive 1/2 plus 1/2 as a whole so this becomes 4 minus X raised to the first power and then we take this out so if you divide this expression by this one the 4 minus X to the negative 1/2 will cancel so we're left with negative 1/2 X to get rid of the negative exponent I'm gonna take this whole turn and move it to the denominator of the fraction so the bottom is gonna be 4 minus X to the 1/2 and in the numerator it's 4 and then we have minus X minus 1/2 X so negative 1 minus 1/2 that's negative 1 point 5 which is the same as a negative 3 over 2 negative 1 you can write that as negative 2 over 2 and so negative 2 minus 1 is negative 3 so this is going to be negative 3 over 2 X now to get rid of the fraction I'm gonna multiply the top and the bottom by 2 so I'm gonna have 8 minus 3 X divided by 2 and then I'm gonna convert this back into a square root so the square root of 4 minus X so that's the first derivative of this function now let's set the first derivative equal to zero and let's calculate the value of X so what I'm going to do is multiply both sides by two times the square root of 4 minus X so this times 0 that's going to remain 0 and then if I take this fraction multiply it by this the denominator will cancel so on the left side I'm just gonna have 8 minus 3x and so let's add 3x to both sides so if we move this to the other side it's gonna become positive and then divide by 3 so X is 8 divided by 3 now what is 8 over 3 as a decimal this is the same as 6 over 3 plus 2 over 3 6 divided by 3 is to 1 over 3 is 0.33 3 3 so 2/3 is like point 6 repeating so we can run that same coin 67 so X is approximately two point 67 and that's well within this interval between 0 & 4 so this is the exact answer for C and this is just an approximation so we can see that Rolle's Theorem indeed apply to this particular function now let's move on to our next example so what about if we have an absolute value function let's say the absolute value of X minus 1 on the interval negative 1 2 3 can we apply rolle's theorem to this particular function well let's draw a graph the absolute value of x the parent function looks like this so this graph is shifted one unit to right so at x equal 1 is gonna have this shape so notice that it's not differentiable at x equals 1 because there's a sharp turn so and 1 is between a and B a is negative 1 be a stream so because 1 is within this interval and it's not differentiable on the open interval a and B we cannot apply rolster them to this particular absolute value function and even if we could there is no horizontal tangent so F prime of C will not equal zero because there's no horizontal section in this particular graph 

Transcript for: Mean Value Theorem
so let's talk about the mean value theorem what's the basic idea behind it so let's say if we have a function f of x let's say it looks like this let's call this point a and point b now if the function f of x if it's continuous on the closed interval a b and if it's differentiable on the open interval a b then there's some number c where f prime of c is equal to f of b minus f of a divided by b minus a so what does this mean on the left side this represents the instantaneous rate of change which is the same as the slope of the tangent line on the right side this is the average rate of change which represents the slope of the secant line now the secant line is the line that touches two points on a curve so we're going to focus on the points a and b to draw the secant line draw a line that passes through both points now the secant line has to be parallel to the tangent line because they're equal to each other they have the same slope and notice that here the tangent line will have the same slope as the secant line they're both horizontal in this case now keep this in mind the secant line touches the curve at two points the tangent line only touches the curve at one point so therefore c is right in the middle between a and b in this example so anytime you have a closed interval if the function is continuous on a closed interval and if it's differentiable on the open interval there's always going to be some number c where the slope of the tangent line is equal to the slope of the secant line where those two lines will be parallel to each other now let's look at another graphical example so let's say this time we have a graph that looks like this and let's say here's a and here's b now is the function continuous on the closed interval a b yes it is there's no jumps no discontinuities no vertical asymptotes is it differentiable on the open interval a b yes it is there are no sharp turns in this graph so therefore we could say that the instantaneous rate of change at c will equal the average rate of change between a and b so in other words the tangent line is going to be parallel to the secant line so the slopes of the tangent line and the secant line will be equal to each other now you've seen this equation in this form the slope between two points is y2 minus y1 divided by x2 minus x1 and f of x is always equal to y so this is x1 and x2 a and b are x values whereas f of b that's going to be y2 and f of a is y1 so this is basically the slope between two points that's where it comes from now let's draw the secant line so the secant line as you mentioned before touches two points on the curve now what do you think point c is such that it's going to be parallel to the secant line c has to be somewhere in this region because if we draw the tangent line it can only touch the curve at one point so notice that these two lines are parallel to each other so that's what the mean value theorem helps us to do it helps us to find some value c between a and b where the slope of the tangent line is equal to the slope of the secant line so now let's work on some problems so let's say that f of x is equal to x squared minus four x plus one on the interval one to five so first can we apply the mean value theorem to this function on this interval now the parent function x squared looks like this it's basically a parabola now it's been shifted to the right and so we could still see that for any parabola it's always going to be continuous everywhere and differentiable everywhere there's no sharp terms in this graph and there's no discontinuities so for any type of polynomial function be it a cubic function a quadratic function a linear function they're all continuous and differentiable so the mean value theorem can be applied to those functions so all we need to do now is apply this formula f prime of c is equal to f of b minus f of a over b minus a so to find this we need to find the first derivative so the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of negative 4x is negative 4 and for a constant and 0. so f prime of x is going to be two x minus four and then a is one b is five so f of b minus f of a that's gonna be f of five minus f of one over 5 minus 1. now let's evaluate f of 5 separately so that's going to be 5 squared minus 4 times 5 plus one five squared is twenty-five four times five is twenty twenty-five minus twenty is five plus one that's six and then f of one that's going to be one squared minus four plus one so one minus four is negative three negative three plus one is negative two so we have two x minus four is equal to f of five which is six minus f of one which is negative two divided by five minus one which is four so six minus negative two that's six plus two so that's eight eight divided by four is two so let's add four to both sides two plus four is six and then if we divide both sides by two we can see that x is equal to three and three is between one and five so therefore we could say that c is equal to three so this is the value of c that satisfies the mean value theorem over the interval one to five for this function now here's another example that we can work on so let's say that f of x is x raised to the two thirds over the interval zero to one can we apply the mean value theorem to this particular function well let's find out so let's start with a graph x to the two thirds has this general shape so we have a cusp at zero so what that means is that it's not differentiable at x equals zero so can we apply it well to apply the mean value theorem it has to be continuous on the closed interval a to b so a is zero and b is one is it continuous from a and b yes it is there's no jumps no holes no infinite discontinuities no vertical asymptotes is it differentiable on the interval a b that is is it differentiable between zero and one yes or no think about that one so we said that it's not differentiable at x equals zero because at x equals zero we have a cusp now is 0 included in this interval no it's not 0 is included in the closed interval but not on the open interval this interval tells us that x is greater than zero but less than one but doesn't include zero so therefore we can apply the mean value theorem because zero is not included so between zero and one it is differentiable it's not differentiable at exactly when x is zero now let's find the value of c that satisfies the mean value theorem for this problem so let's start with this formula f prime of c is equal to f of b minus f of a divided by b minus a so on the left side let's find the first derivative let's use the power rule so it's going to be two thirds x and then two-thirds minus one that's two over three minus three over three which is negative one over three so that's the first derivative on the right we have f of one minus f of zero over one minus zero now let's rewrite this we can rewrite it as two divided by three x to the positive one third by moving x to the bottom we could change the negative exponent into a positive one now f of one that's going to be one raised to the two thirds one raised to anything is one f of zero zero raised to anything is zero and that's over one minus zero which is just one so on the left we have two over three x to the one third on the right we just have one over one which is one i'm going to cross multiply so two times one is two and then on the other side we'll have three x to the one third so now let's divide both sides by three so two thirds is equal to i wrote x too soon x to the one third is the same as the cube root of x now to get rid of the cube root symbol we need to cube both sides two to the third power is eight three to the third power or 3 times 3 times 3 that's 27 so x is 8 divided by 27 and to get that as a decimal that's approximately 0.296 which is between 0 and 1. and so that's the value of c that satisfies the mean value theorem for this problem now let's work on this problem an absolute value expression let's say if we have the absolute value of 4x minus 5 over the interval 0 to 2. can we apply the mean value theorem to this particular function well let's start with the parent function of the absolute value of x so it has a slope of one and it looks like this so notice that it's not differentiable at zero so keep that in mind now how can we graph this particular function how can we identify the vertex to identify the vertex set the inside part equal to zero and so if we add five to both sides and then divide by four the vertex is going to be five over four which is as a decimal one point two five so let's say that's one and this is two so one point two five will be in that region and the slope is 4. so that's just a rough sketch for this particular graph so is the function continuous on the closed interval a b yes it is there's no holes no vertical asymptotes no type of discontinuities is it differentiable on the open interval a b that is is it differentiable between 0 and 2 now we have a sharp turn at x equals 1.25 so it's not differentiable there and this point lies inside this interval so therefore it is not differentiable on the open interval a b as a result because the second condition wasn't met we cannot apply the mean value theorem to this problem and so there's nothing we can do here all we could say is that it's not differentiable at x equals 5 over 4 or 1.25 and so the mean value theorem cannot be applied let's work on one more problem so let's say that f of x is equal to the square root of x minus 4 over the interval 4 to 8. can we apply the mean value theorem in this example well let's start by drawing the graph so let's start with the parent function the square root of x looks like this and so the square root of x minus 4 is going to be shifted 4 units to the right so we have a graph that looks like that so from 4 to 8 is the function continuous on the closed interval a to b and the answer is yes is it differentiable on the open interval a b since there are no sharp turns the answer is yes so therefore we can apply mean value theorem uh to this particular problem so let's start with this equation f prime of c is equal to f of b minus f of a divided by b minus a so in this example we can see that a is four and b is eight so first let's find the first derivative we can rewrite it as x minus four raised to the one half so it's going to be one half x minus four and then one half minus one is negative one half and then the derivative of the inside function x minus four is one and that's equal to f of b minus f of a over b minus a so now let's rewrite this expression we're going to move this to the bottom to make the negative exponent positive and so it's going to be 1 divided by 2 times x minus 4 raised to the one-half and that's going to equal f of 8 which is the square root of eight minus four and then f of four which is the square root of four minus four and then eight minus four is four so on the left we can rewrite that as the square root of x minus four and then eight minus four is four and the square root of four is two four minus four is zero and so this is what we now have and if we cross multiply now one times four is four and then two times two is four and then we could divide both sides by four four divided by four is one now to get rid of the square root we need to square both sides one squared is one and so that's equal to x minus 4 and then if we add 4 to both sides 1 plus 4 is 5. so x is equal to 5 in this case so that is the value of c which is in between a and b it's between four and eight so always make sure c is between a and b and so that's it now you know how to apply the mean value theorem and you know how to use it to find the number c that satisfies the mean value theorem on a closed interval a to b so remember to apply the mean value theorem it has to be continuous on the closed interval a to b and it has to be differentiable on the open interval a to b and if that's the case then you need to find the value of c where the slope of the tangent line is equal to the slope of the secant line you 

Transcript for: Increasing and Decreasing Functions - Calculus
in this video we're going to focus on finding the intervals where a function is increasing and when it's decreasing so let's say if you have a graph anytime the graph is going upward if it's going up then the function is increasing the first derivative is positive now if the graph is going down it can be going down in many different ways when it's going down the function is decreasing and the first derivative will be negative so anytime the function is decreasing the slope is negative and when it's increasing the slope is positive so let's say if we have this particular function let's say that f of x is equal to x squared minus three x plus one so what we need to do in order to find where the function is increasing and decreasing without graphing it we need to find the first derivative set it equal to zero and make a sign chart and then we can determine where it's increasing and decreasing so the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of 3x is 3. now let's set that equal to 0 and if we add 3 to both sides we see that 2x is equal to 3 and if we divide by 2 the only critical number that we have in this example is 3 over 2. now let's make a sign chart so let's put 3 over 2 in it now let's pick a number that's greater than 3 over 2 let's say 4. if we plug in 4 into the first derivative will it give us a positive number or a negative number two times four is eight minus three that's five so that's positive so the first derivative is positive when x is greater than three over two but now what about when x is less than 3 over 2 let's say if x is 0 2 times 0 minus 3 is negative 3 so when it's less than 3 over 2 the first derivative is negative so with this information how can we write the interval where the function is increasing and when it's decreasing now all the way to the right we have positive infinity and to the left we have negative infinity so we could say that the function is increasing between 3 over 2 and infinity and it's decreasing when the first derivative is negative and so that's between negative infinity and three over two so it's decreasing in this section but it's increasing in this section let's work on another example so let's say that f of x is equal to x cubed minus nine x squared plus 24x so go ahead and find the intervals where the function is increasing and when it's decreasing if you want take a minute pause the video and go ahead and try this example give it a shot so let's start by finding the first derivative of the function the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of x is one so we have three x squared minus eighteen x plus twenty four and we can set that equal to zero so let's begin by factoring out the gcf which is 3. 3x squared divided by 3 is x squared negative 18x divided by 3 is negative 6x 24 divided by 3 is 8. so now we need to factor this particular trinomial so what two numbers multiply to eight but add to the middle coefficient negative six four times two is eight but negative four plus negative two adds up to negative six and still multiplies to positive eight so it's going to be x minus four times x minus two so if we set each factor equal to zero this will give us two critical numbers the first one is at x equals four and the second one is at x equals two so now let's make a sign chart i kept this part because i want the first derivative in its factored form it's going to be very helpful for analyzing the sign shine so let's put the critical numbers in a set in order so we have 2 and 4. now the multiplicity of each critical number is odd that means the signs will change across each critical number so if we find the first sign we can easily find the rest so let's start with a number that's greater than four let's try five so five minus four is positive five minus two is positive if you multiply two positive numbers it will give you a positive number so the others should be negative and positive they're gonna alternate so if we try three three minus four is negative three minus two is positive a negative times a positive will give us a negative result let's say if we try something less than two like zero zero minus four is negative zero minus two is negative a negative times a negative is equal to a positive number so now at this point we can determine the intervals where the function is increasing and decreasing don't forget to include your infinity symbols in the number line so the function is decreasing where it's the first derivative is negative and the function is increasing where the first derivative is positive so it's decreasing between two and four but it's increasing between four and infinity and negative infinity and two so let's write the final answer the function is increasing from negative infinity to 2 union 4 to infinity and it's decreasing only between 2 and 4. and so that's it that's how you can find out whether or not a function is increasing or decreasing here's another problem that you can work on this time we're going to have an absolute value function so determine where the function is increasing and decreasing write the intervals for it now for this one there's no need to find the first derivative because it's very easy to graph this function so let's start with the parent function make a bigger graph so if we were to graph the absolute value of x it would look like this it's going to open upward it has a slope of one and the vertex will be at the origin when x is zero but now let's say if we wanted to graph the absolute value of x minus three it's going to shift horizontally 3 units to the right so it's going to look like this now if we were to graph our original function it's still going to shift 3 units to the right so it's going to be somewhere over here but because of the negative sign it's going to open downward instead of upward but with a slope of 2 so it's going to be more narrow so to speak so with this information we can tell where it's increasing and when it's decreasing it's increasing when the function is going up as you view it from left to right and it's decreasing when the function is going down so it's decreasing on the right side increasing on the left side so if we were to make a number line it changes at 3 when x is 3. so to the right of three the function is decreasing which means the first derivative is negative because as you can see the slope is negative on the right side on the left side the function is increasing so the slope is positive so it's increasing on the left of three and decreasing on the right so now to write the final answer the function is increasing from negative infinity to three and these represent x values and it's decreasing from 3 to positive infinity and so that's it so to identify this point all you need to do is take the inside x minus 3 and set it equal to 0. when you do that that's how you can get x equals three so for example let's say if i have this particular a function let's say two x minus eight actually let me use a different one let's say uh three x plus four so to find the vertex i'm gonna set the inside part of the function equal to zero and so the graph is going to change at negative 4 over 3. so when i graph it it's going to look like this negative 4 thirds is like negative 1.33 but this graph is going to open upward instead of downward so notice that it's decreasing on the left side and increasing on the right side so we can write the final answer like this it's increasing from negative 4 over 3 to infinity and it's decreasing from negative infinity to negative 4 over 3. you 

Transcript for: First Derivative Test
in this video we're going to talk about how to use the first derivative test to determine the relative extrema of a function so here is a relative minimum and this is a relative maximum and this graph has no relative minimum or maximum so let's talk about these graphs now for the first one on the upper left corner notice that of the left side of the minimum the function is decreasing so it's decreasing when the first derivative is negative and here the function is increasing it's increasing when the first derivative is positive so according to the first derivative test if the sign of the first derivative changes from negative to positive then you have a minimum in order to have a maximum the function has to be increasing first and then decreasing later so then the first derivative has to change from positive to negative now for the other two graphs the sign will not change notice that the function is increasing and then it stops the slope is zero at this point and then it increases again so notice that the sign doesn't change and for the second one it's always decreasing so therefore the sign doesn't change either so if the sign of the first derivative does not change there is no relative maximum or relative minimum but if it changes from negative to positive then according to the first derivative test a minimum exists or if it changes from positive to negative then there's a local maximum or a relative maximum now let's work on some practice problems consider the function f of x is equal to x squared minus four x plus five so go ahead and use the first derivative test to determine the relative extrema of this function so the first thing we need to do is find the first derivative the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of 4x is 4 and for a constant is 0. once you have the first derivative set it equal to 0 i'm going to factor out 2 and so i could see that my critical number is x equals 2. if you set the factor x minus 2 equal to 0 then x is equal to 2. now once you have the critical number make a sign chart so draw a number line and put the critical number on it and then plug in some test points so to the right of two let's say at three if we plug it into the first derivative will give us a positive number or a negative number three minus two is positive now if we plug in a number less than one i mean less than two like one let's see what's going to happen one minus two is negative so that will give us a negative result so notice that the first derivative it changes from negative to positive so on the left side the function is decreasing and on the right side is increasing and so this correlates to a relative minimum so we have a relative minimum at x equals two now to find the relative minimum value you could plug it back into the function and get the y coordinate so f of two is equal to two squared minus four times two plus five two squared is four four times two is eight four minus eight is negative four plus five that's one so as an ordered pair x is two y is one so these are the coordinates of the relative minimum so the relative minimum is located at x equals two but it has a value of one now let's try this one let's say that f of x is equal to x cubed minus 12x go ahead and use the first derivative test to determine all of the relative extrema in this function so we're going to follow the same process we're going to find the first derivative set it equal to zero and get the critical points so the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of 12x is 12. now let's take out the gcf which is 3. 3x squared divided by 3 is x squared negative 12 divided by 3 is negative 4. and so we could factor x squared minus four using the difference of squares technique so the square root of x squared is x the square root of four is two one is going to be positive and the other will be negative so we have two critical numbers positive two and negative two so now let's create a sign chart and let's put the critical numbers in ascendant order so let's pick a number that's greater than two let's try three three plus two is positive three minus two is positive if you multiply two positive numbers it will give you a positive result now if we pick a number that's between negative two and two let's try zero for example zero plus two is positive and zero minus two is negative a positive number times a negative number that will give you a negative number and then if we pick a number that's less than negative two like negative three negative three plus two that's negative one so that's negative negative three minus two is another negative number if you multiply two negative numbers you'll get a positive number now let's get rid of some stuff so which of these two critical points is the relative maximum and which one is the relative minimum so let's consider negative two the function is increasing and then it decreases so that is a maximum and for positive two it's a decrease and it's negative first and then it's increasing it's positive later that is a minimum and that's a quick and simple way to determine the relative extrema of the function so now let's get the y coordinates so let's start with f of positive two two to the third that's two times two times two that's eight and twelve times two is twenty four so 8 minus 24 is negative 16 which is a relatively low number so that can correspond to the minimum now let's try f of negative 2 so it's a negative 2 to the third minus 12 times negative 2. negative 2 times negative 2 times negative 2 that's negative 8 negative 12 times negative 2 is positive 24 so this gives us positive 16. so the maximum is located at x equals negative 2 but it has a value of 16 and the minimum is positive 2 negative 16. so we can see that the minimum has a much lower value than the maximum and so that's it for this particular example that's how you can use the first derivative test to determine the relative extrema of this function let's work on one more example given the function 3x to the fourth minus 8x cubed plus 6x squared find the relative extrema of this function so just like before let's start with the first derivative the derivative of x to the fourth is 4x cubed and the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and for x squared the derivative of that is two x so three times four is twelve eight times three is twenty four and six times two is twelve so let's set it equal to zero and let's begin by taking out the gcf the greatest common factor is 12x so 12x cubed divided by 12x is x squared negative 24x squared divided by 12x is negative 2x and then 12x divided by itself is one so how can we factor this trinomial so we need to find two numbers that multiply to one but add up to negative two and so that's going to be negative one and negative one so this is gonna be x minus 1 times x minus 1. so the first derivative is going to be 12x times x minus 1 squared so i'm just going to rewrite that up here so let's set each factor equal to zero so if we set 12x equal to zero the first critical number is x is zero and if we set x minus one squared equal to zero we can clearly see that when x is one the whole thing will equal zero so we have two critical numbers zero and one in this example now let's make a sign chart and let's put the critical numbers in ascendant order so the critical numbers are zero and one now let's pick a number that's greater than one let's try two so twelve times two that's a positive number and two minus 1 squared is going to be positive now what do you think the next one is going to be what sign should we put here so we're traveling across this particular critical number and notice that the multiplicity is even if the multiplicity is even it will not change sign but for this one the multiplicity is odd so it's going to change the sign across the zero which means this is going to be negative if you plug in let's say 0.5 12 times 0.5 is positive 0.5 minus 1 is a negative once you square it it's positive if you multiply 2 positive numbers you'll get a positive result but let's say if you plug in negative 1 negative 1 minus 1 is negative but squared is positive 12 times negative 1 is negative a negative times a positive will give us the negative result and so you could use the multiplicities to figure out the rest if you know the first sign so you don't have to use three test points only one now looking at this particular critical number it changes from negative to positive so we have a minimum at zero and at one it's increasing and then it increases again so we don't have a minimum or maximum at one so we just have a minimum at zero and to find the y value if we plug in zero into this there's no constants everything contains an x so y would also be zero so the minimum is located at the origin it's zero comma zero for this particular example and so that's it for this video now you know how to use the first derivative test to determine the relative extrema of a function you 

Transcript for: Concavity, Inflection Points, and Second Derivative
in this video we're going to talk about how to determine the inflection points of a function and the intervals where the function is concave up and concave down so let's talk about concavity first so in this picture the function is concave up everywhere so that's how it looks like and this is the shape of a graph that's concave down now whenever the function is concave up the second derivative is positive which means that the first derivative is increasing when it's concave down the second derivative is negative which means the first derivative is decreasing so make sure you understand that about concavity now to determine the inflection point the inflection point occurs when the second derivative is equal to zero and there's something else that must occur as well at the inflection point the concavity must change either from negative to positive or positive to negative so let me give you some examples so if we focus on the left side of that curve notice that it's concave up you can see the concave up shape and the right side is concave down so at some point in the middle the concavity changes so the point where the concavity changes and that is the inflection point now for the curve on the right it's the reverse so here the graph is concave down and on the right side we could see that it's concave up so in the middle it has to switch from concave down to concave up so anytime the concavity changes from positive to negative or negative to positive we have an inflection point in the middle so the inflection point typically is between the two relative extrema here we have a maximum and here we have a minimum in between those two extreme values exists an inflection point here we have a minimum and on this side we have a maximum and in between those values we have the inflection point so those are some things that you want to keep in mind but now let's work on some practice problems let's put this information to good use so let's say that f of x is equal to x cubed minus nine x squared plus seven x identify all inflection points and determine the intervals where the function is concave up and concave down so the first thing that we need to do is we need to find the second derivative of the function so let's begin by finding the first derivative the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of x squared is 2x times 9 that's 18x and the derivative of x is one times seven so that gives us seven now let's move on to the second derivative the derivative of x squared is two x times three that's six x and the derivative of negative eighteen x is just negative 18. now once we have the second derivative set it equal to zero and find the inflection points so if we factor out six six x divided by six is x negative eighteen divided by six is negative three so we have a potential inflection point at three if you set x minus three equal to zero and add three to both sides you'll get x is equal to three now let's create a sign chart on a number line let's say if we plug in a number that's greater than three like four will the second derivative be positive or negative four minus three is equal to a positive number so it's going to be positive on the right side if we plug in 2 a number less than 3 2 minus 3 is negative so on the left side it's concave down because the second derivative is negative on the right side is concave up all the way to the left we have negative infinity and to the right we have positive infinity so now let's write the intervals so the function is concave down from negative infinity to three and it's concave up between 3 and positive infinity now notice that the concavity changes at 3 it changes from negative to positive so that tells us that we have an inflection point at x equals three now sometimes you may need to find a y coordinate if you do plug in three into the original function to get the y coordinate if you want to write the inflection point as an ordered pair so let's go ahead and do that but first i'm going to make some space so let's plug in 3 f of 3 is going to be 3 to the third power minus nine times three squared plus seven times three if we multiply three three times we'll get twenty seven three squared is nine and seven times three is twenty one twenty seven plus 21 is 48 9 times 9 is 81 and then 48 minus 81 is negative 33. so the inflection point exists at 3 comma negative 33 for this problem so you can write that as an ordered pair now let's work on another problem so let's say that f of x is x to the fourth plus four x cubed plus one so go ahead and find all of the inflection points and the intervals where the function is concave up and concave down so feel free to pause the video if you wanna work on this problem so let's begin by finding the first derivative just like we did before so the derivative of x to the fourth using the power rule is 4x cubed and the derivative of x cube is 3x squared times 4 that's going to be 12x squared and the derivative of a constant is 0. now for the second derivative if we differentiate x cubed that's going to be 3x squared times 4 so that's 12x squared and the derivative of x squared is 2x times 12 that's going to be 24x so let's set it equal to 0 and let's take out the greatest common factor which is 12x 12x squared divided by 12x is x 24x divided by 12x is 2. and so if we set each factor equal to 0 we're going to get two points of interest x is equal to zero and x is equal to negative two so let's create a sign chart and let's put these numbers in ascendant order now let's pick a test point that's greater than zero so let's try one twelve times one is positive one plus two is positive if we multiply two positive numbers it will give us a positive result now let's pick a number between negative two and zero so let's try negative one twelve times negative one is negative but negative one plus two is positive a negative times a positive is a negative and now if we pick a number less than negative two like negative three twelve times negative three is negative negative three plus two is negative so if you multiply two negative numbers it will give you a positive number so here it's concave up in red and it's concave down in blue let's not forget the infinity symbols so at this point now that we've completed the sign chart we can now write the intervals where it's concave up and concave down so let's start where it's concave up it's concave up between negative infinity and negative 2 and then union for the other section 0 to infinity so you just got to write it from left to right negative infinity to negative 2 and then to connect to the other side union 0 to infinity now it's concave down between negative two and zero now we need to determine the inflection points at negative two the concavity changes from concave up to concave down so that's an inflection point and zero is also an inflection point because the concavity changes from negative to positive from down to up so now let's get the y coordinates that correspond to the x coordinates for the inflection points so let's plug in zero first so if we plug in zero into the equation this is just going to equal one so that one of the inflection points is going to be zero comma one now for the other one let's plug in negative two negative two to the fourth power is positive sixteen negative two to the third power is negative eight 4 times negative 8 is negative 32 and 16 minus 32 is negative 16. negative 16 plus 1 is negative 15. so the second inflection point is going to be negative 2 comma negative 15. and so that's it so that's how you can determine the inflection points and the intervals where the function is concave up and concave down so keep that in mind it's concave up whenever the second derivative is positive and it's concave down when the second derivative is negative or less than zero and the inflection point occurs where the second derivative is equal to zero and if the concavity changes if it doesn't change then it's not an inflection point so for example let's say if we performed if we got the second derivative and these were the points of interest so let's say the second derivative is positive when x is greater than 5 but negative between 4 and 5 negative at between 1 and 4 but positive 1 is less than one so one would be an inflection point because the concavity changes and five is an inflection point but four is not an inflection point because the concavity doesn't change across four it doesn't change sign so this would not be an inflection point so keep that in mind the concavity has to change for it to be in a flexion point you 

Transcript for: Second Derivative Test
in this video we're going to use the second derivative test to determine if there's any relative extrema in a function if there's a relative maximum or a relative minimum so let's talk about a relative maximum or a local maximum in order to get a local max the critical number has to be found so the first derivative has to equal zero at some point c so c is the point where the local max will be located along the x axis so f prime of c has to be equal to 0 and the second derivative at c has to be negative or less than zero whenever the second derivative is negative at a critical number it's going to be concave down so you can have this shape and you could see clearly from the graph that there is a maximum at this point and that's going to be the c value that we need that's when we have the horizontal tangent which is typical of a local maximum or relative maximum now to use the second derivative test to identify the local minimum which will occur at a critical number f prime of c must be zero so that's how we could find the critical number and the second derivative at that critical number has to be greater than zero or it has to be positive which means that it has to be concave up so we're going to have that shape and so we could see that we have a minimum at the bottom now let's work on an example problem so let's say that f of x is 2x cubed minus 12x squared so go ahead and use the second derivative test to determine any relative extrema in this particular function so feel free to try it now let's determine the first derivative so we can identify any critical numbers the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared times two well let's do it one step at a time the derivative of x squared is two x and so two times three is six twelve times two is twenty four now to find the critical numbers we need to set the first derivative equal to zero next let's factor out the gcf which in this example is going to be 6x so 6x squared divided by 6x is x negative 24x divided by 6x is negative four and then set each factor equal to zero so if we set six x equal to zero and then divide by six we can see that the first critical number is at x equals zero and if we set x minus four equal to zero and then add four to both sides the second critical number is at x equal four so i'm going to write that at the top over here so i can erase the stuff on the bottom so we have two critical numbers now let's find the second derivative to determine the concavity so we said the first derivative was 6x squared minus 24x now for the second derivative it's going to be 6 times the derivative of x squared which is 2x and 24 times the derivative of x which is 1. and so that's going to be 12x minus 24. so now let's set the second derivative equal to zero and let's take out the gcf which is 12. so we have a potential inflection point at x equals two so let's create a sign chart now if we plug in a test point greater than two let's say three into the second derivative three minus two is positive if we plug in a number less than two let's say one one minus two is negative so it's concave down between negative infinity and 2 and concave up between 2 and infinity so therefore the second derivative at 0 we could say is less than zero it's negative because zero is between negative infinity and two now granted you could just take this number and plug it into this expression actually not that one but you could plug it into 12x minus 24. you really don't need to create a sign chart so just keep that in mind so for the second example instead of using the sign chart i can evaluate f double prime of 4. so that's going to be 12 times 4 minus 24. 12 times 4 is 48 48 minus 24 is 24 so that's positive and as you can see 4 is between 2 and infinity so that's going to be positive as well so f double prime of 4 is going to be greater than 0. when the second derivative is less than zero it's going to have a negative sign and when it's greater than zero that means it's positive when the second derivative is positive we have a graph that is concave up and when the second derivative is negative it's concave down so you can see that a concave up graph is associated with a minimum and a concave down graph is associated with a maximum so at x equals zero we have a maximum and at x equals four we have a minimum and that's how you can use the second derivative test to determine the relative extrema in the function you need to find the critical numbers and then find out what the second derivative is at those critical numbers but now let's confirm our answer using the first derivative test so let's put the critical numbers on this number line now we need to rewrite the first derivative in its factored form so it was 6x squared minus 24x and if we take out 6x it's going to be 6x times x minus 4. so let's say if we plug in a test point that is greater than 4 like 5. 6 times five is positive five minus four is positive if you multiply two positive numbers that will give you a positive result now let's plug in a number between zero and four let's try two 6 times 2 is positive 2 minus 4 is negative a positive and a negative equals a negative now if we plug a negative 1 6 times negative 1 is negative negative 1 minus 4 is negative a negative times a negative is a positive number so going from positive to negative the function is increasing and then it's decreasing so this indicates that we have a maximum at zero which indeed we do and going from negative to positive it's decreasing and then increasing so that's a minimum at 4 which we do have and so that's how you can use the first derivative test to confirm the results of the second derivative test now it's your turn let's say if we have the function f of x is equal to four x cubed minus six x squared minus 24x plus 1. use the second derivative test to determine the relative extrema of the function so first let's find the first derivative to identify all the critical numbers so it's going to be 12 x squared and the derivative of 6x squared that's 12x and for 24x it's just going to become 24. now let's set it equal to 0 and let's take out a 12. so it's gonna be x squared minus x minus two and so we need to factor this expression two numbers that multiply to negative two but add to negative one that's going to be negative two and positive one so to factor it's gonna be x minus two times x plus one so the critical numbers are positive two and negative one if you set each factor equal to zero so now that we have those critical numbers let's determine the sign of the second derivative at those points so first we need to find the second derivative the derivative of 12x squared is 24x and the derivative of 12x is just 12. but we have a negative sign in front so the second derivative at 2 that's going to be 24 times 2 minus 12. 24 times 2 is 48 minus 12 that's positive 36. now let's do the same for the other critical number negative one so it's 24 times negative one which is negative 24 minus 12 that's a negative 36. so at two it's positive therefore it's concave up and at negative one it's negative so if the second derivative is negative then it's concave down and anytime it's concave up it's associated with a minimum when it's concave down it's associated with a maximum this is a max and this is a minimum so we can write the answers over here so at 2 we have a minimum and at negative 1 we have a maximum so let's confirm the results with the first derivative test so let's make a sign chart so first let me get rid of this so the critical numbers are negative one and two so using the first derivative in its factored form let's plug in some test points so i'm going to try three three minus two is positive three plus one is positive next i'm going to try zero zero minus two is negative zero plus 1 is positive so that will give us the negative result and then negative 3 minus 2 is negative negative 3 plus 1 is negative so we're going to get a positive result so for negative 1 it's increasing and then it's decreasing so this is a maximum which we do have at negative one and at two it's decreasing then increasing so we have a minimum at two and don't let this negative 2 confuse you at 2 we do indeed have a minimum so this answer is confirmed and so that's it now you know how to use the second derivative tests to determine the relative extrema of the function and you can confirm it with the first derivative test so make sure you find the critical numbers and then see if the second derivative is positive or negative at those critical numbers if the second derivative is positive that means that it's concave up and so you have a minimum if the second derivative is negative that means it's concave down and you're going to have a maximum at that critical number and so that's it for this video hopefully you found it to be helpful thanks for watching you 

Transcript for: L'hopital's rule
how can we evaluate the limit as x approaches infinity for this expression x squared over e raised to the x well we could try direct substitution so if we replace x with infinity infinity squared is basically infinity and e raised to the infinity is infinity now this is an indeterminate form what is infinity divided by infinity is it one is it zero is it infinity we don't know so when you get into a situation like this you need to use l'hopital's rule and the basic idea of l'hopital's rule is this the limit as x approaches some number c of f of x over g of x is equal to the limit as x approaches c of f prime of x divided by g prime of x so basically what we can do is turn f into f prime and g into g prime we could do so by taking the derivative of the top and the bottom separately and then maybe we can simplify into a form that we can get the answer so the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of e to the x will remain the same now if we use direct substitution we still won't get the right answer it will still be an indeterminate form so we need to do it again the derivative of two x is two and e to the x will stay the same now at this point we can use direct substitution e to the infinity is infinity and whenever you have a fixed number divided by an infinite number you're going to get zero and this time you have a bottom heavy expression where the denominator is very high compared to the numerator this will give you zero one divided by a large number will give you a very small number and this is the answer let's try another example go ahead and evaluate this particular limit the limit as x approaches infinity of the function ln x divided by x so if we use direct substitution this is going to be ln infinity which is infinity divided by infinity so we have another indeterminate form so let's use l'hopital's rule so let's differentiate the numerator and the denominator separately with respect to x the derivative of ln x is one over x and the derivative of x is one so one over x divided by one is just one over x at this point we can use direct substitution so this becomes one divided by infinity which is equal to zero so anytime you have a fixed number divided by infinity it will always give you zero now let's move on to our next example let's evaluate the limit as x approaches 0 for sine 7x divided by sine 4x go ahead and try it so let's jump into l'hopital's rule because if we plug in zero right now sine of seven times zero which is zero sine of zero is zero so this is going to be zero divided by zero and we don't know what that is it could be eight it could be one it could be zero it can be infinity so let's use l'hopital's rule so the derivative of sine seven x is cosine seven x and then according to the chain rule we need to find the derivative of the inside function which is seven and the derivative of sine four x is cosine four x times four so now we can use direct substitution so if we replace x with zero seven times zero is zero so we're gonna have cosine zero times seven and on the bottom four times zero is zero so we could cancel cosine zero because they both equal one and therefore the final answer is seven over four so that's it so that's how you can use l'hopital's rule to evaluate limits here's another example let's try the limit as x approaches 0 sine 8x divided by 3x so if we use direct substitution this is going to be 0 divided by 0. so let's not do that so let's find the derivative of the top and the bottom separately the derivative of sine 8x is going to be cosine 8x times 8 and for 3x it's just going to be 3. so now we can use direct substitution so this is cosine 8 times 0 times 8 over 3. now cosine zero is one and so we have one times eight over three which means the final answer is eight divided by three now what about this problem what is the limit as x approaches infinity of x times ln x so if we use direct substitution we can replace x with infinity and we'll have ln infinity as well the natural log of infinity is infinity and if you multiply a large number by another large number you're going to get an even large number so infinity times infinity is infinity therefore this is the answer now what about this example what is the limit as x approaches infinity of x raised to the 1 over x now if we replace x with infinity it's going to be infinity to the one over infinity one divided by infinity is zero and infinity to the zero power is indeterminate so there's nothing we can do right now except using l'hopital's rule now we don't have a fraction so we need to use a different process here we're going to set the original expression equal to y so y is equal to the limit as x approaches infinity x raised to the 1 over x now we need to take the natural log of both sides the reason why we want to do that is because we can take this and move it to the front now that we have a natural log in front of it it's one of those properties of logs that you need to know so we have 1 over x times ln x which we can write that as a fraction so we could say that's ln x over x so now we can employ l'hopital's rule on the right side so the derivative of ln x is one over x and the derivative of x is one and so we have the natural log of y is equal to the limit as x approaches infinity one over x using direct substitution on the right we can see that the natural log of y is equal to one over infinity and one over infinity is zero so ln y is zero now the base of the natural log is e so e raised to the 0 power is equal to y and anything raised to the 0 power is 1 so y is 1. now recall that y was equal to the limit as x approaches infinity for the original problem x raised to the one over x so we know that y is one therefore the limit as x approaches infinity for x raised to the one over x is one now let's check the work let's see if we indeed have the right answer so let's make a table and let's plug in some values so let's pick a large number let's start with 10. so 10 raised to the 1 over 10 as a decimal that's about one point two five eight nine so it's relatively close to one now let's choose a larger value for x let's try a hundred a hundred raised to the one over a hundred is one point zero four seven one so it's getting closer to one so let's try a thousand a thousand raised to one divided by a thousand that's one point zero zero nine so as x gets larger and larger as it approaches infinity we can clearly see that y is approaching one where y is basically x raised to the one over x as x approaches infinity let's try one more example what is the limit as x approaches zero of one minus two x raised to the one over x go ahead and try that so first we're going to set that equal to y and then we're going to take the natural log of both sides so ln y is going to be the limit as x approaches 0 ln 1 minus 2x raised to the 1 over x basically i reverse the equation i want y to be on the left side so now that i have the natural log i can move the 1 over x to the front and so i can write this as a fraction so i have ln 1 minus 2x and instead of multiplying by 1 over x which is the same as ln 1 minus 2x divided by x now let's use l'hopital's rule now what is the derivative of ln 1 minus 2x to differentiate natural log of u it's going to be u prime divided by u so it's the derivative of the stuff inside which is going to be negative 2 divided by whatever was on the inside which is 1 minus 2x and the derivative of x is 1. so what we now have is the natural log of y is equal to the limit as x approaches zero negative two divided by one minus two x so now we can use direct substitution let's replace x with zero so we no longer need to write the limit expression two times zero is zero and so what we have is one minus zero which is one so therefore ln y is equal to negative 2 over 1 or negative 2. and this is base e so e raised to the negative 2 is equal to y and so once you have the value of y you have the final answer which is e to the negative two so we can write the original problem so we could say that the limit as x approaches zero of one minus two x raised to the 1 over x which this whole thing equals y and y equals e to negative 2. so the limit is equal to e raised to negative 2 which if you want to you can write it as 1 over e squared both answers are acceptable and that's it so now you know how to use l'hopital's rule to evaluate limits of the indeterminate type you 

Transcript for: Curve Sketching - Graphing Functions Using Derivatives | Calculus
in this video i'm going to go over some basic examples of curve sketching particularly for polynomial functions but there's four fundamental shapes that you need to be familiar with so this is the first one this is the second here's the third and this one is the fourth so let's talk about the second derivative this is a concave down shape and whenever you have a shape that's concave down the second derivative is negative so for the two shapes on top because they form a downward u-shape the second derivative is negative for the two shapes on the bottom they form a concave upward shape so the second derivative is positive now for the first derivative if the graph is going up the first derivative is positive if it goes down it's negative so here we have an increase in function it's positive this one is going down so the first derivative is going to be negative here we have another decreasing function is going down so it has a negative first derivative and this one's an increasing function it's going up so the first derivative is positive now the reason why you need to know this is that when you create a sign chart for the first and second derivative you can get an a good idea of how the graph is going to look like at least the curve and i'm going to give you two examples to illustrate that so let's plot this particular polynomial let's say that f of x is equal to x cubed plus six x squared plus nine x go ahead and graph it now the first thing i'm going to do is find the x-intercepts so i'm going to factor out the gcf which is x and i'll be left over with x squared plus 6x plus 9. so that's a perfect square trinomial two numbers that multiply to nine but add to six is three and three three times three is nine three plus three is six so it's x plus three times x plus three which we can write as x times x plus three squared so if we set the function equal to 0 we can see that the x intercepts are 0 and negative 3. so i'm going to put those points in a data table so we have the point zero zero and negative three zero now let's find the first derivative of the function it's going to be 3x squared plus 12x plus 9. now let's take out the gcf which is basically three so we're left with x squared plus four x plus three and then we could factor the trinomial two numbers that multiply to three but add to four are one and three so we can write it as x plus three times x plus one and if we set the first derivative equal to zero we can get the critical points negative three and negative one so we can plot this on a number line and it's good to put the critical points here we already have one of them so the other one we're going to put is negative one now let's create a sine chart so if we plug in a number that's greater than negative one let's say zero zero plus one is positive zero plus three is positive so the first derivative is positive in this region if we plug in negative two negative two plus three is positive negative two plus one is negative so the function is decreasing between negative three and one and if we plug in negative four negative four plus three is negative negative four plus one is negative two negatives make a positive now that's for the first derivative let's create a sign chart for the second derivative also notice that we have a maximum at negative three and a minimum at negative one so at negative three notice that to the left the function's increasing and then to the right is decreasing so that's the max for the negative one critical point it's decreasing then increasing so that's a minimum so i'm just going to mark that here so at negative one we have a minimum and at negative 3 we have a maximum now for the second derivative it's going to be 6x plus twelve so if we set it equal to zero and take out six we can see that a potential inflection point could be negative two so we need to create a sine chart at negative two so if i plug in 0 0 plus 2 is going to be positive and if i plug in something less than negative 2 like negative 3 negative 3 plus 2 will be negative so that tells us the concavity of the graph so what i need to do is combine the two sign charts so we're gonna have the points negative three negative two and negative one so on top i'm going to put the sign for the first derivative and on the bottom for the second so the first derivative is positive to the left of negative three and between negative three and negative one it's a negative and to the right of negative one it's going to be positive so we can get rid of this at this point and keep in mind that we have a max at negative 3 and a minimum at negative 1. now for the second derivative it's negative to the left of negative two and then it's positive to the right of negative two so now let's draw the shapes that we have for these four sections so what type of shape do we have if the first derivative is positive and if the second derivative is negative so let's start with the second derivative if it's negative it's concave down and the first half is the part that's increasing where the first derivative is positive so we need to draw this shape so it's going to look like this let me use different colors so i'm going to make this one red now for the second part the first and second derivative are both negative so it's concave down and we need the second part because the function is decreasing so we need this part now here the first derivative is negative but the second is positive when the second is positive is concave up but if the first is a negative it has to be decreasing so we need that portion and then for the last one it's concave up and the function is increasing so here's our concave up shape and this is the part where the function is increasing so let's combine these four fragments into one graph so it's going up and then the blue part it's going down and then the green part it goes down and then it turns and then the white part it goes up now this is in line with the maximum that we do see at negative three and the minimum that we see at negative one so now we know the general shape of our graph and it makes sense because x cubed the parent function looks like this it's decreasing on the left increasing on the right so all we need to do is combine this shape with this data table so let me get rid of this structure and let's draw a graph now we need to find the y values for those two points so when x is negative one it's going to be negative one to the third plus six times negative one squared plus nine times negative one so that's negative one plus six minus nine so negative one plus six is five five minus nine is negative four now let's do the same when x is negative two so negative two to the third power that's negative eight negative two squared is four times six that's 24 and nine times negative two is negative eighteen twenty four minus eighteen is six negative eight plus six is negative two so now let's graph it so the first point that we have is negative three zero that's the first x intercept and we have another x intercept at 0 0 and then we have a point negative 1 negative 4 and then negative 2 negative 2. now negative 3 0 that's a maximum so i'm going to draw the graph in red so we should have some type of structure that looks like that and at negative 1 we have a minimum and following this graph we know it's going to look something like this let me see if i can do that make it better maybe not but you get the picture so that's the general shape of the graph that we had let's work on one more example so let's say that y is three x to the fourth plus four x cubed go ahead and graph this function so first i'm gonna look for the x-intercepts so i'm going to factor out x cubed and i'm going to have three x plus four so if i set this equal to zero i can see that x is equal to zero and if you set three x plus four equal to zero x would be negative four over three so i'm going to put that into the data table so we have negative four thirds comma zero and zero zero so now let's move on to the first derivative and that's going to be 12x cubed plus 12x squared so if we take out the gcf which is 12x squared we're left with x plus one so the critical numbers are zero and negative one we have zero but negative one is a new one that we can add and let's go ahead and get the y value for that so that's gonna be three times negative one to the fourth power plus four times negative one to the third so that's gonna be three minus four which is negative one now let's plot the critical numbers on a number line so if we plug in let's say 1 1 plus 1 is positive 1 squared times 12 is positive if we try negative one half this is squared so that's gonna be positive negative half plus one is also positive if we try negative two this will always be positive because of the square negative two plus one is negative so this is going to be negative so notice that it's decreasing and increasing so we have a minimum at negative one now the sign doesn't change across zero so we don't have a minimum or maximum so i'm going to write this and we have a minimum at x equals negative one now let's find a second derivative so that's going to be 36 x squared plus 24x so let's set it equal to zero and let's take out 12x so we're going to have 3x plus 2. so the points of interest are this will give us 0 and this will give us negative two thirds which i need to write that in here i already have zero now if i plug in one 12 times 1 is positive 3 times 1 plus 2 is positive if i plug in negative a half 12 times negative 0.5 is negative 3 times negative half that's negative 1.5 plus 2 that's positive a negative and a positive will give me a negative result and if i plug in negative 1 3 times negative 1 plus 2 is negative 12 times negative 1 is negative two negatives make a positive so now i need to combine this into a single chart but before i do that let's find a y value when x is negative two thirds so that's three times negative two over three raised to the fourth power plus four times negative two over three raised to the third power so negative two to the fourth power sixteen three to the fourth is eighty-one and 3 divided by 81 that's going to be like 1 over 27. negative 2 to the third is negative 8 times 4 that's going to be negative 32 and then 3 to the third is 27. 16 minus 32 is negative 16. so this is going to be negative 16 over 27 which is a little bit lower than negative a half so now we can combine the two sign charts so the lowest point is negative one and then it's negative two thirds and then zero so we're going to put the first derivative on top and the second on the bottom so the first derivative is negative to the left of negative one and it's positive everywhere else so to the right of negative one is going to be positive now for the second derivative to the left of negative two thirds it's positive between negative two thirds and zero is going to be negative and then it's positive to the right of zero now go ahead and identify the fundamental shapes that correspond to the sine chart so when the second derivative is positive we know it's concave up and the first derivative is negative so that's going to be the decreasing part of that curve so it's going to be going like this and then for the second part it's still concave up but this is the increase in part of that curve and so we can see why it's a minimum at negative one you could see the minimum here now this one is concave down but it's increasing so we have the right side of it actually i drew the concave up graph this is supposed to be concave down and so this is the increasing portion of it which is this side so we have this particular shape and then this is concave up again which is like this and we have the increase in portion of the concave up curve and let me put that in white so combining these four fragments we're going to have a graph that looks like this so that's the shape of our graph so this is going to be negative one because we have a minimum at negative one the next point of interest is negative two thirds and then at zero we have a horizontal tangent and then that's it so now we just got to take that curve and put it in to an actual graph with the right points so just keep that shape in mind now let's make the graph so we don't need too many points so we're just going to get up to 2 on each side so the first point is that negative four-thirds which is about negative 1.33 comma zero so that's an x-intercept the other x-intercept is at the origin zero zero and then we have the point negative one negative one and then negative two-thirds which is like negative point sixty-seven and negative sixteen over twenty-seven which is somewhere below negative point five so we could say about here so those are the four points they're pretty close to each other now negative one is the minimum so we're going to have this type of shape well let's draw the four shapes that we had the first one was like this if i remember correctly and then the second one was like that and then the third one continued and then went that way and then the fourth one just it kept increasing and the first one if you just extend it it's going to increase as well and so that's it that is the graph that we should have and so we can see the minimum at negative one and that's all i got for this problem so hopefully this gave you a good idea of how you can use the first and second derivative to help you draw a rough sketch of a polynomial function now i have another video on curved sketching that has more examples it's an older video so you can check that out but it still covers the same principles that this video covers it's just a longer video with more examples if you still want to get more practice with this type of topic so thanks again for watching you 

Transcript for: Newton's Method
in this lesson we're going to focus on newton's method for approximating zeros of a function so let's say if we have this function f of x and it's equal to x cubed minus four x squared plus one now there could be at least three solutions to this equation we're going to focus on finding just one of them so we have to guess a value for x we have to pick a value to start with so let's see what the function value is when x is zero so f of zero is going to be one now let's pick the next best number let's try one so this is gonna be one to the third minus four times one squared plus one so that's one minus four plus one one minus four is negative three plus one this is negative two so going from zero to one notice that the y value changes from positive to negative and since this is a continuous function at some point it had to across zero so one solution to this equation that is if we set it equal to zero x has to be somewhere between zero and one there's some value of x where y will equal zero so let's solve this equation so if x cubed minus four x squared plus one is equal to zero what is the value of x so pick a number between zero and one we're going to start with point five that's going to be our first iteration now using newton's method it helps you to calculate the next zero given the first one so x raised to the or x sub n plus one is equal to x sub n minus f of x sub n divided by f prime of x sub n so using the first 0.5 this equation will help us to get a more accurate zero or more accurate solution to the equation so if n is 1 n plus 1 is going to be 2. so we have this expression so x2 is going to equal x1 minus well x1 is 0.5 and then minus f of 0.5 divided by f prime of 0.5 so let's figure out what f of 0.5 is so this is going to be 0.5 raised to the third power minus 4 times point five squared plus one so let's use a calculator for that so this is equal to 0.125 now we need to find the first derivative the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of 4x squared is 8x so now with the first derivative we need to plug in 0.5 as well so this is going to be 3 times 0.5 squared minus 8 times 0.5 so this will give you negative 3.25 now let's plug in everything into this equation so f of 0.5 0.125 and f prime of 0.5 is negative 3.25 so the two negative signs will cancel so it's 0.5 plus 0.125 divided by 3.25 and so this will give us x2 and so that's going to be 0.5385 so now we need to do another iteration so i'm going to rewrite the first derivative here because we're going to use it again so x3 is going to equal x2 minus f of x2 over f prime of x2 so x2 in this example is 0.5385 so let's evaluate the function at x2 so f of 0.5385 let's plug it in into this equation so go ahead and type in your calculator and let's see what that's going to give us 0.5385 raised to the third power minus 4 times 0.5385 squared plus 1. make sure you type in everything correctly if you make one mistake the whole problem is ruined so this is negative point zero zero three seven seven four you might see it as three point seven seven four times ten to the minus three but it's the same and now let's do the same for the first derivative so we're going to plug it in to this equation so it's going to be 3 times 0.5385 squared minus 8 times 0.5385 so you should get negative 3.4 3 so now we can plug these values into that expression so x3 is going to be 0.5385 minus and then f of 0.5385 that's negative 0.00374 and then we need to divide that by negative 3.4381 now notice that this answer is close to zero that means x the solution that we're looking for where the function has a y value of zero is close to this number so x3 shouldn't be too far away from x2 now these two negative signs will cancel so overall we'll still have a negative sign so this is going to be 0.5385 minus 0.00374 divided by 3.43 81 so you should get this answer 0.5374 which is very close to x2 so chances are because the answer is so close that means that this is a good estimation and let's check in we're going to do is plug it into this expression and see if we get an answer that's very very close to zero if we do then we could say this is the solution to the equation or at least it's one of the solutions so let's evaluate f of 0.5374 let's see if it's equal to zero so go ahead and type that in to your calculator so i got 5.41 three six times ten to the minus six so that's very small that's basically point zero zero zero zero zero five four one three six so we could say that is approximately zero which means the solution is 0.5374 that's one of the solutions to this equation and so that's how you can use the newton's method to solve functions you can approximate zeros of the function just by picking a value that's close to the actual zero if the value is too far away you may have some issues with newton's method but if you want to pick a number that's close to the actual zero and using multiple iterations with newton's method each time you do it you're gonna get an answer that's even closer to the real answer so if you do it two or three times it's usually good and as you can see we only had to do it two times for this example so hopefully this gave you a better understanding of how to use newton's method to solve zeros or find zeros of a function so that's it for this video thanks again for watching and have a good day you 

Transcript for: Optimization Problems - Calculus
in this video we're going to talk about optimization problems the goal with these types of problems is that you're trying to optimize something that is you're trying to find the dimensions that will maximize the area of a plot of land or that will minimize the amount of fencing required or if you're dealing with business type problems you're trying to find a situation where you can achieve maximum profit or minimize costs and so that's the goal of these type of problems we're trying to find the optimal conditions to get the best results so therefore in order to solve these type of problems you need to be able to identify the maximum and the minimum values of a function so here we have a local maximum and here we have a minimum now there's two there's one important characteristic of these points in the graph at the maximum value and at the minimum value the slope of the horizontal tangent line is zero therefore to find the location of a maximum or a minimum what you need to do is you need to take the first derivative of the function set it equal to zero and solve for x and you're going to see this in action as we work on problems so let's go ahead and do that let's start with this one find two numbers whose sum is 60 and whose product is a maximum so let's put some variables to these two numbers let's say that these two numbers are x and y now we have two variables in order to solve for two variables we need two equations the two equations are going to be the sum and the product so what's the sum of x and y the sum of x and y is simply s is equal to x plus y the product is just what it is it's the multiplication of those two numbers x times y so those are the two equations that we have now here's a question for you which of these two equations would you say is the constraint equation and which one is the objective function the constraint equation is equal to a number a fixed value the objective function it can vary that's what we're trying to maximize or minimize the objective function is the function that we're going to find the first derivative of set it equal to zero and solve for either x or y now we don't know the value of the product but we do know the value of the sum so the sum is a fixed value therefore this is the constraint equation and this is the objective function what we need to do is we need to differentiate p we need to find the first derivative of p set it equal to zero and solve for x or y but right now we can't do that because p is in terms of two variables we need to get p in terms of one variable before we could find the first derivative and that's where the constraint equation comes so what we're going to do is we're going to isolate y in the constraint equation so let's subtract both sides by x 60 minus x is equal to y and then what we're going to do is in the objective function we're going to replace y with 60 minus x so we have p is equal to x times 60 minus x now let's go ahead and distribute x so we have 60x and then minus x squared so now we have p in terms of one variable at this point we could find the first derivative of p and set it equal to zero so p prime is going to be 60 minus 2x and let's set that equal to zero so adding 2x to both sides we get 60 is equal to 2x and then dividing both sides by 2. we can see that x is 60 over 2 which is 30. now at this point we can go ahead and calculate y so let's take 30 and let's plug it into this equation to get y 60 minus 30 is equal to y so y 2 is 30 as well so now we have both numbers whose sum is 60. if we wish we can calculate the product by plugging it into this equation so thirty times thirty we know that three times three is nine and then if we add the two zeros we get a product of nine hundred so that is the maximum product so that's it for this problem the two numbers are 30 and 30 and the maximum product is 900. now let's make sense of these numbers let's see let's check to see if we have the right answer so what we're going to do is we're going to make a table we're going to have x y the sum s and the product p the maximum product occurs when both x and y are 30. we get a maximum product of 900. what if x was 10 and y was 50. in this case the sum is still 60 which that always has to be the case 10 times 50 is 500 so this is not more than 900. if x was 20 y would have to be 40. the sum would still be 60 but 20 times 40 is 800. now let's say if y was 23 x would have to be 37 37 times 23 is 851. it's still less than 900. let's say if x was 32 and y was 28 the sum is still 60. 32 times 28 is 896. or if x is 29 and y is 31 29 times 31 is 8.99 so regardless of what combination of x and y that we choose as long as the sum of x and y is 60. the maximum product that we can achieve is 900. any other combination of x and y with a sum of 60 will be less than 900. so we indeed have the right values of x and y that lead to the maximum product and that's the goal of optimization you want to find the numbers or the conditions that will maximize or minimize something number two find two numbers whose difference is 40 and whose product is a minimum and also find the value of the minimum product so let's write the equations the difference of two numbers let's say the two numbers are x and y so let's say y is larger in value so the difference is going to be y minus x the product just like before is going to be x times y now which will be the constraint equation and which one will be the objective function we know the value of the difference we don't know the value of the product so because we know the value of the difference this here 40 equals y minus x that's going to be the constraint equation this is going to be the objective function the objective is to minimize the product so let's get this equation in terms of one variable let's add x to both sides so we get 40 plus x is equal to y now let's replace y with 40 plus x in the objective function so the product is going to be x times 40 plus x and now let's distribute so here we have x times 40 which is 40x and then x times x which is x squared now let's find the first derivative of the objective function that's going to be 40 plus 2x and then let's set it equal to 0. now i'm going to move the 2x to the other side where it's going to be negative 2x and then i'm going to divide both sides by negative 2. and so x is negative 20. so now that we know the value of x we could plug it into the constraint equation to get y so 40 plus negative 20 will give us y and so that's equal to positive 20. so at this point we have two numbers whose difference is 40 20 minus negative 20 is positive 40. and now we need to calculate the product so it's going to be negative 20 times 20 and so the product is going to be negative 400. so this is the minimum product that we can get from two numbers whose difference is 40. and let's confirm this with a table so we're going to have x y the difference d and then the product p so we had 20 for y and negative 20 for x that gave us a difference of 40 but a product of negative 400. let's see if we can find two of the values for x and y with a difference of 40 but a product that's lower than negative 400. if we were to try 0 and 40 the difference will be 40 but the product 0 times 40 is 0. 0 is higher in value than negative 400 at least on a number line so 0 is not the minimum product if we try a value of 20 for x y it's going to be 40 units higher than x so it's going to be 60 so that the difference is still 40. 20 times 60 is 1200 this is not less than negative 400 is higher we want to find something that's lower than negative 400. if we try 10 and 50 and that's not gonna work this is going to be 500. we were to try let's say negative 10 and 30 30 minus negative 10 that's still positive 40 but this would be negative 300 which is still higher than negative 400 if we were to try negative 25 with 15 the difference is 40 but negative 25 times 15 that's negative three seventy five if we were to try negative twenty one and nineteen we would get negative three ninety nine so the lowest product is negative 400 that is the minimum product that we can get with two numbers that have a difference of 40. and so we can see that the process works so the answer is negative 20 and 20 with a minimum product of negative 400. number three find two positive numbers whose product is 400 and whose sum is the minimum feel free to pause the video if you want to work on this so the product is going to be x times y and the sum is going to be x plus y now we're trying to find we're trying to minimize the sum so the sum is the objective function we have the value of the product so the constraint equation will be 400 is equal to x times y once you replace p with 400 this becomes an equation and so that right there is the constraint equation now let's solve for y so let's divide both sides by x so we get that y is 400 over x now let's replace y with that so the sum is going to be x plus 400 over x so now that we have our objective function in terms of one variable we can go ahead and find the first derivative but before we do that let's rewrite this equation let's move the x variable to the top so this is x plus 400 times x to the minus one now let's find the s prime the first derivative this is going to be 1 minus 400 and then x we'll subtract this by negative 1 so this becomes negative 2. and we'll set this equal to 0. and i'm going to move this value to the other side so it becomes positive so we have 1 is equal to 400 times x and minus 2. now we can put this over one and let's bring the x back to the bottom so that the negative exponent will become positive so this becomes 400 over x squared now let's cross multiply one times 400 is 400 and 1 times x squared is x squared if we take the square root of both sides we get that x is going to be plus or minus 20. now we want two positive numbers so we're going to go with positive 20 instead of negative 20. so that's the value of x that we have so far now let's calculate the value of y so let's plug it into this equation 400 divided by 20 is going to be 20. you can cancel 0 it becomes 40 over 2 which is 20. so we have the two numbers at this point x is 20 and y is 20. now the last thing we could do which is optional we don't have to but we can calculate the sum the minimum sum is going to be 20 plus 20 which is 40. and you can confirm this with a table kind of like what we did before but you'll find that the minimum sum the lowest sum that we can get with two numbers that multiply to 400 is 40. number four find a positive number where the sum of that number and its reciprocal is a minimum so let's use s for sum let's say the positive number is x the reciprocal is one over x now this problem is a little bit different than the other problems we've considered so far because we don't have a constraint equation all we have is the objective function and that's okay because the objective function is not in terms of two variables it's only in terms of one variable so we can go ahead and find the first derivative but before we do that let's rewrite it as x plus x to the negative one let's move this to the top so now let's find the first derivative of s the derivative of x is one the derivative of x to the minus one is going to be we need to move the negative 1 to the front and then we got to subtract the exponent by 1 which makes this negative 2 and we'll set that equal to 0. now let's move this to the other side so we have 1 is equal to one x to the negative two now let's bring this to the bottom so we have one is equal to one over x squared and then we can cross multiply so this gives us 1 is equal to x squared taking the square root of both sides x is equal to plus or minus 1 but we only want the positive number so we're going to go with positive 1. so that's the answer for this problem now let's check our answer so let's make a table where we're going to have x one over x and a sum so when x is one one over x will be one the sum of x and the reciprocal one plus one will be two now can we find some other positive number x where the sum and its reciprocal will be less than 2. remember we want to minimize the sum if we were to make x equal to two this would be one over two two plus a half is two point five that's greater than two not less than it so that doesn't work if x is three this will be one over three this will be about three point 3.33 so let's pick a number lower than 2 but greater than 1. let's say if we chose 1.5 and 1 over x or 1 over 1.5 that's 0.6 repeating and if you add that to 1.5 you're going to get 2.16 repeating which is more than 2. if we're to try 1.1 1 over 1.1 is 0.90 repeating so that's like .9090 and if you add that to 1.1 that will be 2.009 which is more than 2. if we try a number like 0.8 1 over 0.8 is 1.25 and if you add that to 0.8 you get 2.05 so as we can see the minimum sum is going to be two we can't get anything lower than that and that occurs when x and its reciprocal they're both equal to one find the dimensions of a rectangle with a perimeter of 200 feet with an area as large as possible so let's draw a rectangle now let's say this is the length and this is the width the perimeter of a rectangle is 2l plus 2w and we have the perimeter so the perimeter is 200 now to simplify this equation i'm going to divide everything by 2. so this is going to be my constraint 100 is equal to l plus a w the objective function is to maximize the area we want the area to be as large as possible and the area of a rectangle is left times width now let's solve for w in this equation so we need to subtract both sides by l 100 minus l is w and now let's replace w in the objective function with a hundred minus l so we have the area is l times w where w is a hundred minus l now let's distribute l so it's a hundred l minus l squared so now since we have the area of the objective function in terms of one variable only we can now find the first derivative the derivative of a hundred l is a hundred and the derivative of l squared is two l so let's set it equal to zero let's move negative two l to the other side so it can become positive two out and then we could divide by two so half of a hundred is fifty so l is fifteen so now we could use this equation to calculate w so w is 100 minus l so that's 100 minus 50 which is 50. so both the length of the rectangle and the width are equal to 50. now if we want to calculate the area we could simply do length times width and so the maximum area is going to be 50 times 50 and the units is going to be in feet so 50 feet times 50 feet that's 2500 square feet so that's the maximum area for this particular problem and these are the dimensions it's 50 by 50. a farmer has 600 feet of fencing and wants to create a rectangular field along a river he needs no fence along the river itself what are the dimensions of the field that has the largest area so let's begin by drawing the river so here we have the river and he's going to create a fence around this river so there's no need to put a fence here now let's label the dimensions so let's use x and y so let's call this y and let's call this x so the perimeter is going to be x plus 2y instead of 2x plus 2i because there's no x here so the perimeter is just a sum of all three sides so it's x and then y plus y gives us 2y now we have the perimeter the farmer has 600 feet of fencing remember square feet is for area and just feet is perimeter so p is 600 and so this is the constraint now he wants to maximize the area he wants the largest area and the area of a rectangle is left times width or in this case x times y so this is the objective function and this is the constraint for the constraint equation should we solve for x or y i think it's easier if we solve for x because if we solve for y we have to divide by two and you're going to have x over 2 and you have to deal with fractions so let's subtract both sides by 2y or just move it to this side so we have 600 minus 2y is equal to x no fractions so now let's replace x in the objective function with 600 minus 2y so the area is going to be 600 minus 2y times y so let's distribute y so it's going to be 600y minus 2y squared so now that we have the area function or the objective function in terms of one variable we should now find the first derivative so it's going to be 600 minus 2 times 2y which is going to be 4y and then set it equal to 0. now let's move the negative 4y to the other side so it can become positive 4y and then let's divide both sides by 4. so 600 divided by 4 is 150 so we now have the value for y now keep in mind x we said it was 600 minus 2y so that's going to be 600 minus 2 times one fifty two times one fifty is three hundred and six hundred minus three hundred is three hundred so we now have the dimensions y is one hundred fifty feet x is 300 feet now to calculate the maximum area using this equation it's going to be x times y 300 feet times 150 feet and let's see what that's going to be so that's going to be 45 000 square feet so that is the maximum area the dimensions are 300 feet by 150 feet with a maximum area of 45 000 square feet so that's it for this problem now let's move on to the next problem it's similar to the first but a little different so we have this farmer he wishes to create a rectangular field along the river but this time he has a fixed area instead of a fixed perimeter and the area has to be ten thousand square feet what are the dimensions of the field that will require the least amount of fencing and let's also determine the amount of fencing that he needs as well so let's begin by drawing a river and we have the same type of picture so we're going to call this x and y and you can try this problem if you want to as well so this time the area is the constraint so we know the area is x times y and the area is 10 000 square feet now the perimeter is the stuff that we're trying to minimize because we want the least amount of fencing and so that's going to be x plus 2y now i'm going to solve for y in this equation so i need to divide by x so y is going to be 10 000 divided by x so now i'm going to replace y with that so 10 000 times 2 that's 20 000. so the perimeter is going to be x plus twenty thousand and then x to the negative one so now let's find the first derivative that's gonna be one plus twenty thousand times negative one x to the minus two and then let's rewrite the expression so we have one minus twenty thousand over x squared and let's set that equal to zero so i don't need this picture anymore but let's keep in mind that p is x plus 2y so i'm going to take this term move it to this side so i have one is equal to 20 thousand over x squared and i'm going to write one as one over one and then cross multiply so twenty thousand is equal to x squared now let's take the square root of both sides so this will give us the value for x so x if you round it it's going to be about 141.42 feet so now that we have x let's go ahead and calculate y using this equation so y is going to be 10 000 divided by x or divided by 141.42 and so that's going to be about 70.75 so that's the value for y so now that we have x and y which is what we needed to find so that represents the dimensions of the rectangle we can now calculate the minimum perimeter or the minimum amount of fencing that we need so it's going to be x plus 2 times y so the perimeter is going to be approximately 282.8 feet and that's the answer number eight a farmer uses sixteen hundred feet of fencing to enclose a rectangular area which will be divided into three pens what is the maximum total area of the three pens that he can enclose with the limited amount of fencing that he has available well let's draw a picture so we're dealing with a rectangle and this rectangle is going to be divided into three pens now we could call the vertical lengths y and the horizontal length with the horizontal fence in x so that's the situation that we have so far our goal is to maximize the area the area of all three pens is simply x times y its length times width now the total amount of fencing is going to be the length of all of the sides so we have x plus x that's 2x and then we have four y's that we need to add together so that's gonna be plus four y now we can replace f with sixteen hundred so this is our constraint equation now all of the coefficients are even so to simplify this equation i recommend dividing everything by 2. so we get 800 is equal to x plus 2y now it's going to be a lot easier if we isolate x rather than y so let's subtract both sides by 2y so we get that 800 minus 2y is equal to x now let's plug this into our objective equation and so we're going to replace x with what we have here 800 minus 2y so the area is going to be 800 minus 2y times y so we got the area function in terms of one variable now let's distribute y so this is going to be 800 y and then minus 2y squared so now let's find the first derivative the derivative of 800y is just 800 and for negative 2y squared it's negative 4y and we'll set that equal to 0. add in 4y to both sides we get 800 is equal to 4y and dividing both sides by 4 800 divided by 4 is 200 so y is 200 feet now once we have the value for y we can plug it into this equation to get x so 800 minus 2 times 200 that's going to be equal to x so that's 800 minus 400 which is 400 feet so now we have the dimensions that's going to give us the maximum area but the goal in this problem is to simply calculate that maximum area so all we need to do at this point is multiply x by y so x this should be x not y x is 400 feet and y is 200 feet now we know that two times four is eight and then we'll add the four zeros and so the total maximum area is going to be eighty thousand square feet find the point on the line y equals three x plus five that is closest to the origin so let's draw a graph now this linear equation is in slope-intercept form so we could see that m the number in front of x is 3 and b is 5. so the intercept is five and the slope is three so i'm just going to draw a rough sketch and let's say it looks something like that we really don't need an exact picture but somewhere along this line we're going to have a point that is closest to the origin so let's assume it's that point let's call it point p if we draw a right triangle we could say d is the distance between the origin which is represented by o and point p and this is going to be x which is going to be a negative value and y is going to be a positive value so notice that x squared plus y squared is equal to d squared so if we solve for d d is going to be the square root of x squared plus y squared so this is the objective function because we want to minimize the distance and this equation here is the constraint so let's replace y with three x plus five so d is going to be the square root of x squared plus 3x plus 5 squared now we need to find the first derivative of that function so i'm going to rewrite it first so let's rewrite it as this expression and let's raise it to the one half now to differentiate that function we need to use the chain rule so let's start with the power rule let's move the one half to the front keep the inside function the same and then we'll need to subtract the exponent by one one-half minus one is negative one-half and then we need to find the derivative of the inside function the derivative of x squared is 2x and to differentiate this we need to use the chain rule again so it's going to be plus 2 keep the inside part the same 2 minus 1 is 1 times the derivative of the inside function which is 3. so that's the first derivative now let's distribute the one half to everything inside here you shouldn't distribute it to both it doesn't work that way just one of the brackets so one-half times 2x is just x and we can also cancel that too as well because we have to distribute it to everything inside those brackets so on top we're going to have this is d prime by the way x plus i'm going to distribute three to three x plus five so three x times three is nine and then five times three is fifteen and on the bottom if i move this to the bottom the negative exponent will become positive one half and then i can convert this back into a radical so it's gonna be the square root of x squared plus three x plus five squared now we need to set this equal to zero the good thing is if the numerator is equal to zero the entire fraction is equal to zero so let's set the numerator equal to zero x plus nine x is ten x so ten x plus fifteen is equal to zero moving the 15 to the other side we have 10x is equal to negative 15 divided by 10 that becomes 15 is 5 times 3 10 is 5 times 2 so we could cancel 5 so x is negative 3 divided by 2 or negative 1.5 so this is the first answer now we need to find the y coordinate of the point which for the last step is not going to be too difficult to do and so we have y y is 3x plus 5. so that's going to be three times negative three over two plus five so that's negative nine over two and five we can multiply by two over two so it becomes ten over two negative nine plus ten is one so we have the point negative three over two comma one half and so that is the point that is closest to the origin and that's how you can find it number ten find the point on the line y equals four minus x that is closest to the point seven comma six so let's begin by drawing a picture so let's plot y equals 4 minus x so the x intercept if we plug in 0 for x y is going to be 4 so that's actually the y intercept to get the x intercept we need to plug in 0 for y and solve for x so we get an x-intercept of four so we got the point four comma zero and we also have the point zero four so that's a rough sketch of the line y equals four minus x now at the point seven comma six we need to find the point on the line y equals 4 minus x that is closest to this point so how can we do that let's assume that point is here so that point has an x value and it has a y value now let's draw a line connecting these two points we want to minimize the distance between those two points so once again we could use the distance formula d is equal to the square root of x2 minus x1 squared plus y2 minus y1 squared so we could say that 7 is x2 and 6 is y2 and the point that we're looking for we'll call this x1 and y1 so let's replace x2 with 7 and x1 we're going to replace it with x y2 is equal to 6 and y1 we're just going to replace it with y so we have this equation now just so you can understand what's happening here this distance is x this distance is seven if we turn this into a right triangle the base of that right triangle is the difference between 7 and x so this base here is 7 minus x now this part is y and this part here is six the difference between those two parts give us the height of the triangle which is six minus y and so the distance is basically the hypotenuse of that right triangle which is basically the square root of a squared plus b squared so now you see how this equation relates to the pythagorean theorem of a right triangle now there's one more thing we need to do here before we could find the first derivative our goal is to minimize d and right now d is in terms of two variables x and y so what we need to do is we need to replace y with four minus x so d is going to equal now instead of writing the square root symbol we can raise it to the one half so this is going to be seven minus x squared plus six minus and then let's replace y with four minus x squared and all of this is raised to the one-half now six minus four is two negative times negative x that's going to be positive x and so now at this point we have d in terms of one variable we have d as the function of x so now we could find the first derivative and set it equal to zero to solve for x so let's go ahead and do that let's use the power rule let's move the one half to the front we'll keep the inside the same and then we're going to subtract the exponent by one so one half minus one is negative half next based on the chain rule we're going to take the derivative of the inside function so the derivative of 7 minus x squared is going to be 2 times 7 minus x raised to the first power times the derivative of the inside which is negative one for this part it's going to be two times two plus x raised to the first power we got to subtract this by one and then times the derivative of the inside the derivative of two plus x is just one so this part here is going to be the numerator of the fraction that we're about to get but let's distribute one half to these two terms this one half will cancel with the twos that we have here so in the numerator we have 2 plus x and then we have a negative 7 and we have a positive x now this we could bring it to the bottom and it's going to be inside of a square root so on the bottom we have the square root of 7 minus x squared plus 2 plus x squared and we're going to set this equal to 0. now because we have a fraction if the numerator of the fraction is zero the value of the entire fraction is zero so technically all we need to do is set the numerator to zero so here we have x plus x which is two x and then two minus seven that's negative five that's going to be equal to zero adding five to both sides we have two x equals five dividing both sides by two we have our x value which is five over two or two point five so now that we have the value of x we can calculate y y is 4 minus x 4 minus 2.5 is 1.5 1.5 is the same as 3 over 2. so thus we have the point p with the coordinates five over two and three over two so this is the point that is on the line y equals four minus x but it's closest to the point seven comma six so that's our answer number eleven find the point on the curve y equals six x squared minus x cubed plus 10 that has the highest slope and calculate the maximum value of the slope if we want to calculate the slope of the function we need to find the derivative of the function the derivative is a function that gives us the slope at some value of x our goal is to maximize the slope so we need to maximize the derivative function to maximize the derivative function the second derivative must be set equal to zero when the second derivative is equal to zero the first derivative may be a maximum value or it could be a minimum value so that's the goal for this problem we need to find the second derivative of the function and set it equal to zero and then solve for x so let's begin with the first derivative the derivative of x squared is 2x the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and for the constant 10 the derivative for that is zero so this gives us 12x minus 3x squared now let's find the second derivative the derivative of 12x is simply 12. the derivative of 3x squared is negative 6x if we factor out a 6 we'll get 2 minus x now let's set that equal to 0. we can clearly see that x is equal to 2. now let's make a number line so 2 is the critical point for the first derivative if we were to plug in 3 into this function 2 minus 3 will give us a negative value if we were to plug in 1 2 minus 1 will give us a positive value so to the left of 2 the function is rising to the right of 2 the first derivative not not the original function but the first derivative is decreasing so that's the first derivative has a maximum at two if these signs were reversed that means that it would have a minimum value at two thus the point on the curve with the highest slope occurs at an x value of 2. so now we need to find the y value of that point so let's plug in x into the original equation so we have y is equal to six times two squared minus two raised to the third power plus ten two squared is four times six that gives us 24 2 to the third is eight and 24 minus eight is sixteen sixteen plus ten is twenty six so the point for the first part of the problem occurs at an x value of 2 and a y value of 26 so that's the answer for part a for this problem now let's move on to part b calculate the maximum value of the slope the value of the slope can be found from the derivative function which is right here so we're going to plug in an x value of 2 into this function so it's going to be 12 times 2 minus 3 times 2 squared 12 times 2 is 24 2 squared is 4 times 3 that's 12. so we get a slope of 12. so that is the value of the slope when x is equal to 2. and we could check to see if that is indeed the maximum slope so let's make a table and let's rewrite our first derivative function which was 12x minus 3x squared if we were to plug in 0 the slope would be 0. if we were to plug in 4 this would be 12 times 4 minus 3 times 4 squared that would be 0. if we were to plug in 3 into this equation it's 12 times 3 minus 3 times 3 squared that would be 9. if we're to plug in 1 it will be 12 minus 3 which is also 9. so we could see that the maximum slope occurs at an x value of 2. so that's it for part b so part b is equal to 12. part a the answer is 2 comma 26. number 12 a rectangle is inscribed in a semicircle with a radius of 10 centimeters what are the dimensions of the rectangle that will maximize its area and also calculate the maximum area well let's draw a picture so let's say this is the semi-circle let's see if i can do a better drawing and we have a rectangle inscribed inside of the semi-circle so here is the y-axis and this is the x-axis now the radius of the semi-circle is 10. so that means this point here along the x-axis is 10 and this point along the y-axis is 10. now let's call this part of the rectangle x and let's call this part y so drawing a rectangle like this we can see that the length of the rectangle is x and x so it's 2x and the width of the rectangle is this portion which is y so the area of the rectangle is length times width the length is 2x the width is y so the area is just 2x times y now what is y in terms of x to answer that question we need to know the equation of a circle the equation of a circle is x squared plus y squared is equal to r squared solving for y squared if we subtract both sides by x squared we get that y squared is r squared minus x squared and then if we were to take the square root of both sides y is going to be plus or minus the square root of r squared minus x squared so that's the equation for a full circle now we have two signs positive and negative for the upper half of the circle it's positive root r squared minus x squared for the bottom half of the circle it's y equals negative r squared minus x squared so since we're dealing with the upper half of the semi-circle or rather the upper half of the circle which is a semi-circle we could say that y is just the positive square root of r squared minus x squared and r is 10. so r squared is going to be a hundred so we have y is equal to the square root of 100 minus x squared so we can say that the area is going to be 2x times the square root of 100 minus x squared the area function is the objective function that's the function that we're trying to maximize and right now we have it in terms of one variable so we can go ahead and find the first derivative and set it equal to zero now we need to use the product rule since we basically have two things multiplied to each other and if you recall the derivative of f times g is f prime g plus f of g prime so think of the 2x as f and the square root of 100 minus x squared sg so let's go ahead and find the first derivative of the area function so the derivative of 2x is simply 2 that's f prime we're going to keep g the same so that's the square root of 100 minus x squared next we'll keep the first part of the function the same 2x and then we need to differentiate this so keep in mind this is 100 minus x squared raised to the one half so this is going to be times one half we'll keep the inside part the same we'll subtract the exponent by one one half minus one is negative a half and then we need to differentiate the inside part of the function the derivative of negative x squared will be negative 2x now let's take a minute to make some space so i'm going to rewrite the area function here it's l times w which is 2x times y which is 2x times the square root of 100 minus x squared so now let's delete this and so we have a prime is equal to 2 square root 100 minus x squared now we can cancel the two and the one half and so we're left with x times negative 2x which is going to be negative 2x squared and this term we can move it to the bottom make this exponent positive and convert it back into its radical form so on the bottom we're just going to have the square root of a hundred minus x squared now this we can put it over one what we need to do is we need to get common denominators so we can combine it into a single fraction so i'm going to multiply this fraction by 100 minus x squared top and bottom so now we have a prime is two when we multiply these two the square root will disappear and we're just going to get a hundred minus x squared and then we have the other term so at this point we can write it as a single fraction so we can say that a prime this is 2 times 100 which is 200 here we have negative 2x squared plus another negative 2x squared so that's going to be negative 4x squared all over the square root of 100 minus x squared so we're going to set this equal to zero if we multiply both sides of this equation by a hundred minus x squared these will cancel on the right we'll get zero times the square root of 100 minus x squared which is still zero so the end result is that we'll have the numerator equal to zero if we add four x squared to both sides we get two hundred is equal to four x squared dividing both sides by four we get 50 is equal to x squared and then we could take the square root of both sides the square root of 50 we can write that as the square root of 25 times the square root of 2 and the square root of 25 is 5. so now we know what the value of x is so x is 5 square root 2. so now we can calculate y we know that y is the square root of 100 minus x squared which is what we have here and we know that x squared is 50. if you square this you'll get 50. so this is the square root of 100 minus 50 which is the square root of 50 and we know that's going to simplify to 5 square root 2. so in this problem both x and y have the same value now our goal in part a is to determine the dimensions of the rectangle that will maximize this area which means we want to calculate the length and the width of the rectangle so the left of the rectangle is 2x and x is 5 root 2. so the length of the rectangle in this problem is going to be 10 square root 2. so that's the first part of the answer the width of the rectangle is simply equal to y and y is 5 square root 2 and the units are centimeters so we can write the dimensions as 10 square root 2 by 5 square root 2 left times width now part b calculate the maximum area now that we know the dimensions of the rectangle we can calculate the maximum area that we can form when the rectangle is inscribed in a semicircle with a radius of 10 centimeters so the area is simply going to be the length of the rectangle times its width the length is 10 square root 2 the width is 5 square root 2. now 10 times 5 is 50. and the square root of two times the square root of two is the square root of four which is two so it's fifty times two which is a hundred for these types of problems whenever you have a rectangle inscribed in a semicircle and you're given the radius a quick way to find the maximum area of the rectangle that's inscribed in such a semi-circle is you could use this formula the maximum area is simply going to be r squared so in this problem r is ten ten squared is a hundred so you get a hundred square centimeters so don't forget to pay attention to the units so that's a quick and simple way to calculate the maximum area it's always going to be r squared for this type of problem so the units for the dimension will be the same as the unit for the radius but the unit for area will be square units so this is inches the area will be square inches if this was feet the area will be square feet you 

Transcript for: Marginal Cost and Average Total Cost
in this video we're going to go over basically this problem on marginal cost and average costs so let's say if we have the cost function c of x and let's say it's equal to 1500 plus five x plus point zero one x square so find the cost average cost and marginal cost to produce two hundred units so let's find the cost at a production level of two hundred so all we need to do is replace x with two hundred so it's going to be fifteen hundred plus five times two hundred plus point zero one times two hundred squared now five times two hundred that's a thousand and two hundred squared is forty thousand times point zero one that's going to be four hundred so fifteen hundred plus a thousand that's twenty five hundred plus four hundred so that's twenty nine hundred so the production level at 200 so that is the total cost of selling 200 units is 2 900 now what about the average cost let me write per 200 units so what's the average cost per unit the average cost is basically the cost divided by x so it's going to be 2900 the total cost to make 200 units divided by those 200 units and so we could cancel the two zeros and then it becomes 29 divided by two which is fourteen dollars and fifty cents so that's the average cost to make one unit of an item now what about the marginal cost how can we determine the marginal cost to produce 200 units the marginal cost is basically the first derivative of the cost function so it's c prime of x the derivative of a constant like 1500 is zero the derivative of five x is five and the derivative of x squared is two x times point zero one so that's going to be point zero two x now we need to evaluate it at a production level of two hundred so that's five plus point zero two times two hundred now two times two hundred is four hundred point two times two hundred will be forty so point zero two times two hundred is four and then four plus five is nine so this is basically nine dollars per unit so what does this tell us what's the basic idea behind the marginal cost the marginal cost tells us the additional cost that it will take to make one extra unit so we said that the total cost to make 200 units if you recall was 2 900 so what is the total cost to make just one extra unit so 1 plus 200 is 201 well let's plug it into this equation and let's see what's going to happen so it's 1500 plus 5 times 201 plus 0.01 times 201 squared so this is still going to be 1500 now 5 times 200 is a thousand and five times one is five so that's going to be a thousand and five and then 201 squared times .01 that's 404.01 so let's go ahead and add the three numbers so this will give you 2909.01 now look at the difference between the cost at a production level of 200 and the total cost at a production level of 201. the difference between those numbers if you take 2909.01 and subtract it by 2900 that will give you a difference of nine dollars and zero one cent so the cost to make an additional unit increase by nine dollars approximately and that's what the marginal cost tells us it tells us how much it will cost us if we're going to produce one extra item and you can see that based on the difference between these two values now let's move on to part b find the production level that will minimize the average cost so how can we do that in order to find the minimum average cost or the production level that leads to the minimum average costs you need to know a simple fact and that is that the average cost is a minimum when the marginal cost is equal to the average cost by the way c of x i'm going to use that to represent the total cost function and when you see this line above the c i use that to represent the average cost function just in case you're wondering now we said the marginal cost was basically five plus point zero two x now the average cost is basically the cost function divided by x now the cost function which is what we had at the very beginning that was fifteen hundred plus five x plus point zero one x squared now we need to divide this function by x and then it becomes the average cost function so i'm going to divide every term by x separately which is the same as dividing the whole thing by x so everything on the right side now represents the average cost function so all we need to do at this point is solve the equation x represents the production level so we need to calculate the value of x so the left side is going to stay the same for now and on the right side we're going to have 1500 divided by x 5x divided by x the x variables will cancel and so that's going to give us 5 and x squared over x that's just x and we're going to have 0.01 x now if we subtract both sides by 5 they will cancel so that's just going to disappear and then we need to subtract both sides by 0.01 x so on the right side these will cancel and on the left point zero two minus point zero one is point zero one and that's equal to fifteen hundred divided by x so now what we need to do is cross multiply fifteen hundred times one is fifteen hundred and then point zero one x times x that's point zero one x squared so let's divide both sides by point zero one fifteen hundred divided by point zero one when you divide by point zero one is the same as multiplying by a hundred so this becomes a hundred and fifty thousand and that's equal to x squared so now we need to take the square root of both sides and so x is going to be 387.3 but we need to round to the nearest unit so we're going to say it's about 387 units so that's the production level that will minimize the average cost so at this production level the average cost should be the lowest value part c we need to find the minimum average cost so we need to take this x value and plug it into the average cost function now we said that the average cost function is the total cost function divided by x now the total cost function was fifteen hundred this is the original problem that we had or the original equation plus five x plus point zero one x squared and to find the average cost you need to divide it by x so the average cost function is 1500 over x plus 5 plus 0.01 x so let's calculate the average cost at 387 units so let's see what answer we're going to get so this will give us 12. and 75 cents so this is the minimum average cost now to verify that we do indeed have the minimum average cost i'm going to calculate the average costs at a number below 387 and at a number above 387 so let's try 350 and 420 so at 350 this is going to be 1500 over 350 plus 5 plus 0.01 times 350 so let's see what that's going to be so it's going to be 12. and 79 cents which is more than 12.75 now let's do the same thing at a production level of 420. let's see what we're going to get and so it's going to be 12 and 77 cents which is still more than 12.75 so therefore this is the minimum the lowest average cost per unit and the production level that gave us that minimum average cost is 387 so this answer is the answer to part b that's an x value and part c is the value in dollars so this is the answer for part c and that's it for this video so now you know how to calculate the average cost the marginal cost and you know how to find the minimum average cost as well thanks for watching you 

Transcript for: Marginal Cost, Marginal Revenue, and Marginal Profit
the cost and demand functions are shown below what is the average selling price at a production level of 500 units so this is the demand function also known as the price function and it tells us the selling price at a certain production level so don't confuse this with the profit function this is the price function so the price at 500 is going to be 50 minus point zero one times five hundred now point zero one times five hundred that's five so this is fifty minus five which means this is going to be 45 so if the company is selling 500 units the average price that they're charging for is going to be 45 dollars per unit now let's move on to part b what is the revenue total cost and profit at a production level of 500 units let's start with the revenue the revenue function or the sales function is going to be x times p of x so it's the production level times the selling price and so that's going to be as an equation that's going to be x times p of x which is 50 minus 0.01 x so it's 50x minus 0.01 x squared so now let's calculate r of 500 so that's going to be 50 times 500 minus 0.01 times 500 squared so that's going to be twenty two thousand five hundred now let me help you to understand what this number represents so we know that the price the average price at 500 units is 45 dollars per unit and we're selling 500 units so it's going to be 500 units times a selling price of 45 dollars per unit and so we can see that the word unit will cancel and it's just 500 times 45 and that gives you a total revenue of 22 500. so that's how much money the company is receiving for selling 500 units of this particular product and so that's the revenue now what about the total cost and the profit of the company well we already have the total cost function and here it is so we just gotta plug in five hundred so let's see what this is going to give us so the cost is seven thousand now let's determine the profit so to distinguish the profit from basically the price function i'm going to put this little bar on top now the profit function is the difference between the revenue function and the cost function so p of x is going to be r of x where r of x was 50x minus 0.01 x squared keep in mind r of x is just the price times x and then minus the cost function which is 2500 plus 4x plus .01 x squared so let's begin by distributing this particular negative sign so it's going to be 50x minus 0.01 x squared minus 2500 minus 4x minus 0.01 x squared now let's combine like terms so we have 50x minus 4x so that's going to be 46x and then we have negative 0.01 minus 0.01 so that's going to be negative 0.02 x squared and then minus 2500. now let's calculate the profit level at a production level 500 so it's going to be 46 times 500 minus 0.02 times 500 squared minus twenty five hundred so the profit is fifteen thousand five hundred so we have the total cost at a production level of 500 at seven thousand dollars and the profit of the company at a production level of 500 is 15 500. and we saw that the revenue at that same production level was 22 500. and that makes sense because if you subtract the revenue by the cost two thousand five hundred minus seven thousand you should get a profit of fifteen thousand five hundred because the profit is the difference between a revenue and a cost now let's move on to part c find a production level that will maximize the profit so how can we do that how can we determine the production level that will maximize the profit well we know that p of x the profit function is the difference between the revenue and the cost function so if we were to find the first derivative of that equation we'll get p prime of x is equal to r prime minus c prime so p prime is the marginal profit that's the derivative of the profit function this is the marginal revenue and this is the marginal cost to maximize a certain function or variable if you want to find a maximum value of a function you need to set the first derivative equal to zero so we want to determine the maximum profit or the production level that would lead to the maximum profit and the maximum profit will occur when the marginal profit is equal to zero which means that r prime minus c prime will be equal to zero so let's focus on that so if i add c prime to both sides of that equation then r prime is equal to c prime whenever the profit is a maximum and so that's how we can find a production level that will maximize the profit we need to set the marginal revenue equal to the marginal cost now we said that the revenue function was 50x minus 0.01 x squared now let's find the marginal revenue the derivative of 50x is 50. the derivative of x squared is 2x times 0.01 so that's 0.02x and then for the marginal cost that's going to be the derivative of this expression the derivative of the constant 2500 is zero the derivative of four x is four and the derivative of point zero one x squared is going to be point zero one times two x or point zero two x so now what we need to do is set the marginal revenue equal to the marginal cost another way in which you can get the same answer is if you set the marginal profit equal to zero because that's where this equation came from so that's another way to get the same answer but let's set these two equal to each other so 50 minus 0.02 x is equal to 4 plus 0.02 x so let's subtract both sides by four and at the same time let's add point zero two x to both sides so 50 minus 4 is 46. .02 plus 0.02 is 0.04 now let's divide both sides by 0.04 so 46 divided by 0.04 is 11.50 so this is the production level that will maximize the profit so if the company wants to make the most money that it can and needs to sell 1150 units to receive the most profit that they can possibly make now let's calculate the maximum profit so we said that the profit function was 46 x minus 0.02 x squared minus 2500 and so if we plug in 500 i mean that 500 by 1150 it's going to be 46 times fifty minus point zero two times eleven fifty squared minus twenty five hundred and so this will give you twenty three thousand nine hundred fifty so that is the maximum profit that the company can make if they choose to sell 1150 units now by the way the other way to get the answer as you mentioned before is to set the marginal profit equal to zero so the marginal profit is going to be the derivative of this function so that's going to be 46 minus 0.02 times 2x or 0.04 x and this will be 0. so if we set this equal to 0 and solve for x you're going to get the same answer it's going to be 46 divided by 0.04 which we know to be 1150 so there's two ways in which you could find the profit or the production level that will maximize the profit so you can find the marginal profit and set it equal to zero and solve for x or you could set the marginal revenue equal to the marginal cost function and then solve for x both methods will lead to the same answer now let's verify that this is indeed the maximum profit so let's organize the information that we have into a table so we're going to have x and p of x so we already know the profit at a production level of 500 and the maximum profit occurs at eleven fifty so let's calculate the profit at a thousand thirteen hundred and fifteen hundred so we have two numbers below this number and two numbers above it so at five hundred units we know that the profit is fifteen thousand five hundred let me use the dollar simple and we know that at eleven fifty the profit was the maximum profit was twenty three thousand nine fifty go ahead and calculate the profit at a production level of a thousand thirteen hundred and fifteen hundred using this equation so forty-six times a thousand minus point zero two times one thousand squared minus twenty five hundred that's going to be twenty three thousand five hundred so we can see that it's less than twenty three thousand nine fifty so now let's try thirteen hundred forty six times thirteen hundred minus point zero two times thirteen hundred squared minus twenty five hundred so that's going to be twenty three thousand five hundred as well and so that's less than twenty three thousand nine fifty and let's try fifteen hundred so forty six times fifteen hundred minus point zero two times fifteen hundred squared minus twenty five hundred that's going to be twenty one thousand five hundred so we can clearly see that the maximum profit does occur at this production level because this value is the highest it's the maximum value that's listed of all the numbers in the second column so the production level that leads to the maximum profit is 11.50 and the maximum profit itself is 23 950 now let's move on to part e what is the marginal profit at a production level of 500 units so we said the marginal profit we wrote it down already it's the derivative of this function which turned out to be 46 minus .04 x now let's calculate it at a production level of 500 units so that's 46 times 0.04 times 500. by the way the marginal profit at 1150 because that's the maximum will be equal to zero anytime you wish to find the maximum value of a function the first derivative must be equal to zero so just keep that in mind so 46 times .04 times 500 that's 26. so the marginal profit at a production level of 500 is 26 dollars per unit so what does this number mean the marginal profit tells us the change in profit if we sell an additional unit so the profit at a production level of 500 is 15 500. so what is the profit at a production level of 501 so let's plug in 501 into this equation so it's going to be 46 times 501 minus 0.02 times 501 squared minus 2500 this will give you fifteen thousand five hundred twenty five point ninety eight now notice the difference between these two numbers if you subtract fifteen thousand five twenty five point nine eight by fifteen thousand five hundred the difference is twenty five dollars and ninety eight cents which for the most part rounds to twenty six dollars per unit and so the marginal profit at 500 units will tell us approximately the increase in profit going from 500 to 501 so if we sell one extra unit it gives us a good approximation of how much the profit will change so going from 500 to 501 it tells us that the profit will increase by approximately 26 and so that's the meaning behind the marginal profit then the same is true for the marginal revenue and the marginal cost the marginal revenue tells you the change in revenue if you decide to sell one more unit and the marginal cost tells you the change in the total cost if you decide to sell one additional unit and so hopefully that gives you a good idea behind the meaning behind the marginal profit margin of revenue and marginal costs so that's it for this video thanks for watching and have a good day you 

Transcript for: Antiderivatives
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the antiderivative of a function so what is the antiderivative well as the name implies it is the opposite of differentiation we know the derivative of f of x is f prime of x so the anti-derivative or the integral of f prime of x is f of x so f of x is the antiderivative of f prime of x whereas f prime of x is the derivative of f of x now the integral or the antiderivative of regular f x is capital f of x so capital f is the antiderivative of lowercase f and lowercase f is the antiderivative of f prime of x so hopefully that gives you a good idea of what the anti-derivative is so let's say if we have the second derivative of a function and we want to find the first derivative and we can go we can keep going forward in this direction i just want to give you an overview of these different symbols and functions so going to the right we're looking for the anti derivative going to the left we're looking for the derivative the process of finding the antiderivative is basically integration the process of finding the derivative is differentiation so hopefully that summarizes everything that you need to know about this conceptually now we said that capital f is the integral of f of x dx now you you get capital f plus c you always get the a constant of integration but we're not going to worry about that here what i'd like to do right now is distinguish what is an indefinite integral versus a definite integral so this here is what is known as an indefinite integral an indefinite integral gives you a function typically in terms of x but it could be in terms of some other variable like y or z or something like that a definite integral doesn't give you a function but it gives you a number so this is a definite integral the result of a definite integral is always a number like 20 negative 8 45 or something and you can easily identify or distinguish a definite integral from an indefinite integral a definite integral have limits of integration it has a lower limit and an upper limit an indefinite integral does not have the limits of integration so that's how you can easily distinguish between them now we know that the derivative of x cubed is three x squared according to the power rule the derivative of a variable raised to a constant is the constant times the variable raised to the constant minus one well the antiderivative of a variable raised to a constant it's going to be that variable raised to the constant plus 1 divided by the constant plus 1 and then plus c the constant of integration so that's how we could find the antiderivative of a variable raised to a constant so let's find the antiderivative of three x squared so let's rewrite the constant now the variable raised to the constant that's x squared so we're going to do is we're going to add 1 to the exponent so it's going to be 2 plus 1 and then we're going to divide by that result so it becomes 3 x cubed divided by 3 and this gives us the original function x cubed but we need to add the constant of integration plus c if you were to find the derivative of x cubed plus c x cubed will become three x squared the derivative of a constant will become zero so you end up with the same thing so always when you're looking for the indefinite integral of something or the anti-derivative you need to put the constant of integration the only time you don't need to worry about the constant of integration is if you're finding the definite integral where you get a number besides that anytime you get a function add plus c when you're looking for the indefinite integral or the antiderivative so now let's work on some problems go ahead and find the antiderivative of the following functions feel free to pause the video and work on these examples so for the first one we're just going to add one to the exponent 4 plus 1 is 5 and then we're going to divide by the result and then add the constant of integration so it's x to the fifth power over five plus c for the next one it's going to be x to the eight over eight plus c for the next one it's gonna be six and then we're gonna add one to nine that becomes ten divided by 10 plus c now this one we can reduce 6 over 10 if we divide both numbers by 2 that becomes 3 over 5. so we could say this equals 3 over 5 x to the 10 plus c for the next one it's going to be eight x to the four over four plus c and we know eight divided by 4 is 2. so this is 2 x to the 4 plus c so as you can see it's not that difficult to find the anti-derivative of a function so go ahead and try this one find the antiderivative of so let's write it this way let's say f of x is x cubed minus 4x squared plus 8x what is the antiderivative capital f of x of that function so go ahead and find the antiderivative f of x to do that we're going to find the indefinite integral of x cubed minus 4x squared plus 8x but just to show our work let's do it this way first so the antiderivative is going to be the indefinite integral of f of x dx so that's the formula and now let's replace f of x with x cubed minus 4x squared plus 8x dx so the antiderivative of x cubed is going to be x to the four over four and then for four x squared is going to be four x cubed over three and then for eight x it's eight x squared over two plus c now let's rewrite it so we're going to write it as 1 4 x to the 4 minus 4 over 3 x cubed and then 8 over 2 is 4. so we'll write that as 4x squared plus c so this is the antiderivative of the original function now let's try another problem so let's say f prime of x that is the first derivative of x i mean the first derivative of f rather let's say that's equal to eight x cubed minus six x squared plus four x minus seven so given f prime of x find the anti-derivative f of x go ahead and try that so first let's write an expression involving indefinite integral so we could say that f of x is the indefinite integral of f prime of x dx so f of x is the antiderivative of f prime of x so f of x is going to be the indefinite integral of 8x cubed minus six x squared plus four x minus seven feel free to pause the video if you wanna try this so the antiderivative of x cubed is x to the fourth over four for x squared it's x cubed over three and for x to the first power it's x squared over two and then if you have a constant like seven all you gotta do is add an x to it we'll talk more about that shortly and then finally plus c so now let's simplify our answer so the antiderivative is going to be 8 divided by 4 is 2 so we have 2 x to the fourth power 6 divided by 3 is also 2 4 divided by 2 is the same so this is the anti-derivative of our original function two x to the fourth power minus two x cubed plus two x squared minus seven x plus c so as you can see it's not too difficult to find the anti-derivative but there are other things that you need to know go ahead and find the indefinite integral of these expressions let's make this a z all right so go ahead and try those so let's start with the first one we want to find the indefinite integral of a constant 5 and we have dx in front of it so we know it's going to be 5x but let's see if we can get the answer using the power rule five is the same as five x to the zero any variable raised to the zero power is one so x to the zero is one times five which is equivalent to five now using the power rule this is going to be 5 we're going to add one to the exponent and then divide by that result so the end result is that you get 5x plus c so whenever you have a constant and you wish to integrate that constant just add a variable to it now the variable that you should add is based on what you see here either dx dy dr or dz so what is the indefinite integral of 70y so instead of 7x this is going to be 7 times y plus c so the differential dx dy it tells us what variable we should be adding to the constants the indefinite integral of 8 dr that's going to be 8 times r plus c for six z plus four it's going to be six and then z to the first power that becomes z squared over two four becomes four z and then we'll add plus c so this we could simplify it as three z squared plus four z plus c so that is the indefinite integral of six z plus four try this problem so let's say you're given the first derivative of f and let's say it's seven this should be not f of x but f prime of y so let's say it's seven y cubed minus three y plus eight and your goal is to find capital f of y how would you do it feel free to pause the video and try it so first let's write a mental outline of what we need to do here we're given the first derivative of f we need to find f so f is the antiderivative of f prime but we're not going to stop there we need to find capital f so what we need to do is we need to integrate the function two times so we have a successive integration problem so first let's integrate it the first time let's find regular f or little f so this is going to be the indefinite integral of f prime of y d y so that is the indefinite integral of 7 y cubed minus three y plus eight so the antiderivative of y to the third is going to be y to the fourth over four the antiderivative of y is y squared over two and for the constant eight there's just going to be eight y based on what we have here d y and then plus the constant c so that's f of y we don't know what the value of c is if we were given a point of f of y we could find c but we'll save that for another problem so this here is the general function of f of y so now let's find capital f of y that's going to be the indefinite integral of f of y d y so that is the indefinite integral of seven over four y to the fourth minus three over two y squared plus 8y plus c as well and we're going to have d y so the anti-derivative of this we're going to rewrite the constant and then we'll find the anti-derivative of y to the fourth so that's going to be y to the fifth over five and then minus let's rewrite the constant first so we have three over two and then the anti-derivative of y squared is going to be y to the third over three and then it's going to be plus eight times y squared over two now we have the constant of integration c so we're going to add a y to it it's going to be c times y and then plus a new constant which we'll call d so this becomes seven over twenty y to the fifth here we can cancel the threes so it's going to be minus one half y to the third plus four y squared plus c y plus d so that is the second antiderivative of f prime of y which is capital f of y by the way for those of you who want access to the full length version of this video check out the links in the description section below if you join my youtube channel membership program you can get access not only to the full-length version of this video but many other full-length versions of other videos that i have on youtube which you'll see over time so feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance now let's work on finding the indefinite integral of other types of functions what is the indefinite integral of pi d theta feel free to pause the video and work on that and what is the indefinite integral of e let's say e d s so pi is a constant let's compare to the indefinite integral of seven d y 7 is a constant and we would add the variable y to it so this will be 7 y plus c so pi is a constant and here we're going to add the variable theta to it plus c so that's the indefinite integral of pi d theta so remember pi is a constant it's 3.14 with some other numbers after that let me find out what those other numbers are so it's 3.141592654 with some other numbers so whenever you see pi it's just a constant so treat it as if it's any other number like seven or eight or negative four the same is true for e e is not a variable it's a constant e is equal to two point seven one 8 2 8 and so forth so when looking at a problem like this e is the constant s is the variable so this is going to be e times s plus c whenever you're finding the indefinite integral of something you need to be able to distinguish the constant from the variable in order to integrate it properly now let's focus on finding the indefinite integral of rational functions what is the indefinite integral of 1 over x squared to find this before you integrate it you need to rewrite the expression we need to move the variable from the bottom to the top so this is x to the negative 2. at this point we could use the power rule so we can integrate it by adding one to the exponent so it's going to be negative two plus one and then dividing by that result plus c negative two plus one that's negative one and after you integrate it you need to rewrite it again so we want to get rid of this negative exponent and we can do so by moving the variable back to the bottom so that leaves a 1 on top and then we're going to have x to the first power on the bottom which we can just leave as x the negative sign i'm going to move it to the top so the final answer is negative 1 over x plus c now let's try this one what is the indefinite integral of one over x to the fifth power dx so feel free to pause the video and try it so just like before let's move the variable to the top so we have the integral of x raised to the negative 5 dx and then let's add one to that so negative five plus one is negative four and then we're going to divide by that result next let's rewrite the expression so we're going to move the variable back to the bottom and the negative sign we're going to move it to the top so we're going to have negative 1 we have a 4 on the bottom and x and then this negative 4 becomes positive 4 plus c so negative 1 over 4x to the fourth plus c that is the indefinite integral of 1 over x to the fifth power try this find the indefinite integral of 7 over x cubed dx so like before we're going to move the variable to the top so we're going to rewrite the integral so this is 7 x to the negative 3 dx and now let's integrate so negative 3 plus 1 that's negative 2 and then we're going to divide by negative 2 and then we'll have plus c so next we're going to move the variable back to the bottom and the negative sign i'm going to move to the top so this becomes negative seven we have a two on the bottom and we have x squared as well so it's negative seven over two x squared plus c so that's how you can integrate rational functions go ahead and try this expression find the indefinite integral of 5 x to the 7 minus 9 over x squared plus 4x minus 8 dx so this is going to be 5 x to the 8 over 8. now for negative 9x squared we need to write that as negative nine x to the negative two so that's gonna be negative nine x negative two plus one is negative one divided by negative one and then for four x to the first power that will be four x squared over two and then minus eight x plus c so we can rewrite this as five over eight x to the eight plus nine the two negative signs will cancel and then we can move the x variable to the bottom so it's plus whoops it's plus 9 over x and then plus 2x squared minus 8x plus c so that is the indefinite integral or the antiderivative of this expression now what is the antiderivative of 1 over x dx what do you think we need to do here well if we were to try the same approach that we've been using for rational functions let's say if we were to rewrite the expression by moving x to the top we would get the indefinite integral of x to the negative 1 dx now using the power rule if we add 1 to negative 1 we'll get x to the zero and if we were to divide by that result we would get something that is undefined so this technique doesn't work for one over x instead this is an integral that you should commit to memory the integral of one over x dx is simply ln x so you may want to add that to your list of notes and if you recall the derivative of ln u where u is a function of x is u prime over u so the derivative of ln x is going to be u prime if u is x u prime the derivative of x is one so we get one over x so that's the anti-derivative of one over x to the first power so if the anti-derivative of one over x is l and x what is the antiderivative of one over x plus three this is simply the natural log of x plus three so based on that go ahead and find the antiderivative of the following expressions 1 over x minus 5 dx 5 over x plus 2 dx and 7 over x plus 4 dx so this is going to be the natural log of x minus 5 plus c now typically if your answer is like different than l and x normally you'll see an absolute value around x minus 5. and the reason for this is that you can have a negative number inside the natural log it's going to be like it's going to give you an error in the calculator so typically you'll see an absolute value symbol for expressions that can be negative for the next one let's move the constant to the front so think of this as 5 times the integral of 1 over x plus 2 dx so this is going to be 5 times the natural log and let's put our absolute value symbol so it's 5 ln x plus 2 plus the constant of integration for the next one let's do the same thing let's move the constant to the front so this is going to be 7 natural log x plus 4 and then plus c so that's how you can integrate rational functions where the denominator is a linear function like x plus 2 x minus 5 and so forth now here's a general formula that you can use when integrating rational functions like one over u we use a function of x it's going to be one over u prime times the natural log of u plus c now this works if and this is a big if if u is a linear function in the form ax plus b now a could be zero b could be zero well if a is zero doesn't work but b could be zero but u has to be a linear function in that form if there's like an x squared or an x cube this formula is not going to work so let me repeat that u has to be linear function if you have a square root of x or anything but x to the first power this will not work so now let's try some harder examples based on that what is the indefinite integral of one over three x plus four and let's compare that to the indefinite integral of one over x plus seven so in this case we can see that u is 3x plus 4. the derivative of u which is u prime the derivative of 3x is 3 the derivative of 4 is just nothing c u prime is 3. so this becomes 1 over 3 ln absolute value 3x plus 4. and then plus c so this fraction is a result of the derivative of that expression for the next one the derivative of x plus seven is just one here the derivative of three x plus four is three so that's why you gotta incorporate that so for the next one u is gonna be x plus seven and u prime is just gonna be one so this becomes ln absolute value x plus 7 plus c so knowing that go ahead and try these two oh by the way let's go back to what we had before let's prove that this is indeed the right answer so let's find the derivative of one third times ln three x plus four so this is going to be 1 over 3 and keep in mind the derivative of ln x or lnu rather is u prime over u so the u part is what is inside of the natural log function and so that's three x plus four u prime the derivative of three x plus four is just three and the derivative of c is zero and so when we cancel the threes we're going to start with our original function which is what we had here so that shows you that the process works you 

Transcript for: Basic Integration Problems
in this video we're going to go over some basic integration rules so let's say if you want to integrate dx for example this will give you x plus some constant c if you wish to integrate d y this will give you y plus c or if you want to integrate dt that will give you t plus c and so this is the variable of integration and make sure you always add that particular variable based on what you see here now what if we have a constant so let's say if we wish to integrate a constant with a variable of x this is going to equal kx plus c so if i want to integrate 5 dx this is going to be 5x plus c if i wish to integrate let's say 12 d y that's going to be 12y plus c or 4 dt this is going to be 4t plus c now another rule that you need to be familiar with is the power rule the anti-derivative of x raised to the n dx is equal to x raised to the n plus one divided by n plus one plus some constant c so let me give you some examples of using this power rule so let's say if we wish to find the anti-derivative of x squared dx this is going to be x raised to the 2 plus 1 divided by 2 plus 1 plus c so it's x cubed over 3 plus c which you could write that as 1 3 x cubed plus c so let's try some more examples using the power rule go ahead and find the anti-derivative of x cubed 10 x to the fourth and also let's say one over x squared go ahead and try these problems so for this one 3 plus 1 is 4 so it's going to be x to the fourth over 4 plus c for the next one 4 plus 1 is 5 so it's x to the fifth over 5. but we could simplify it 10 divided by 5 is 2 so it's 2x to the fifth power plus c now what about the last one 1 over x squared what can we do for that example before you integrate it you need to rewrite it so we can rewrite it as x raised to the negative 2 dx and then use the power rule so it's x raised to negative two plus one divided by negative two plus one plus c and so negative two plus one is negative one and then we can rewrite the final answer as negative one over x plus c so anytime you have a rational function like this one make sure to rewrite it so let's try another simple example let's say if we want to integrate 7 over x to the fourth power try that one so first let's rewrite it as seven x raised to the negative four and then let's use the power rule so it's going to be negative 4 plus 1 divided by negative 4 plus 1 plus c and negative 4 plus 1 is negative 3. so then this is equal to negative seven divided by three x to the third power plus c and that's the final answer now you can also use the power rule when integrating radical functions let's say if we want to find the antiderivative of the cube root of x so first you need to rewrite it this is x to the one third and then use the power rule so this is going to be x raised to the one-third plus one divided by one-third plus one plus c so one-third plus one we need to get common denominators and one is the same as three over three and one plus three is four so we can write this as x raised to the four thirds divided by four over three plus c now we can multiply the top and the bottom by the reciprocal of four over three and that is three fourths so on the bottom the threes will cancel and the fours will cancel so we can rewrite the final answer as three fourths x raised to the four over three plus c now let's go over the anti-derivatives of six trigonometric functions the antiderivative of cosine x is sine x you should write these down and commit them to memory the antiderivative of sine x is negative cosine x now keep in mind if you know the derivative then you can know the anti-derivative the derivative of sine is cosine the derivative of cosine is negative sine so the derivative of negative cosine is positive sine now the anti-derivative of secant squared that's equal to tangent x and the anti-derivative of secant x tangent x dx that's going to be secant x plus c and the antiderivative of cosecant squared is going to be negative cotangent x plus c and the antiderivative of cosecant x cotangent x that's negative cosecant x plus c so hopefully you had a chance to write that down and let's work on some example problems go ahead and integrate this function eight cosine x plus three sine x dx so the antiderivative of cosine we said is sine so this is going to be 8 times sine and the antiderivative of sine is negative cosine and let's not forget to add plus c so the final answer is 8 sine x minus 3 cosine x plus c and so if you know the formulas it's very easy to integrate trigonometric functions that look like this here's another one that you could try find the antiderivative of four secant squared x minus secant x tangent x so the anti-derivative of secant squared we know it's tangent x and the anti-derivative of secant tan is secant x so this is the answer it's 4 tangent x minus secant x plus the constant of integration c let's work on one more example with regards to trig functions let's integrate cosecant x times cotangent x minus cosecant x now for this particular example we need to rewrite it before we integrate it let's distribute cosecant to cotangent minus cosecant so cosecant times cotangent that's just cosecant cotangent we still have the integration symbol and then cosecant times cosecant is cosecant squared now the antiderivative of cosecant cotangent is negative cosecant x and the antiderivative of cosecant squared is negative cotangent x so the final answer is going to be i'm going to reverse these two so i have positive cotangent x and negative cosecant x this part is positive because we have two negative signs now let's talk about integrating exponential functions like e to the u it's going to be e to the u divided by u prime plus c if u is a linear function or if u prime is a constant if u prime is not a constant this will not work so let's work on some examples let's say if we want to integrate e to the 4x it's going to be the same thing e to the 4x divided by the derivative of 4x which is 4. because this is a constant this will be the right answer now let's say if we want to integrate e to the seven x minus three let's not forget dx so it's going to be the same thing e to the seven x minus three and the derivative of seven x minus three is a constant like 7 and so that's going to be the answer now let's say if we want to integrate e to the x it's going to be the same thing divided by the derivative of x which is 1 so it's simply e plus some constant c now this one won't work we can't say it's e to the x squared divided by 2x this is not a constant so in this situation this will not be the answer if you try to find the derivative of this expression it will not give you e to the x squared now let's move on to logarithmic functions the antiderivative of one over u d u is going to be the natural log of u divided by u prime and the same is true u has to be a linear function and u prime must be a constant if it's a variable it won't work so let's say if we want to find the anti-derivative of one over x it's going to be ln x divided by the derivative of x which is one plus c so let's say if we want to integrate one over x plus five it's going to be the natural log of x plus 5 and the derivative of x plus 5 is 1 and so it's just ln x plus 5 plus c now try this one what's the antiderivative of one over four x minus three so it's going to be the natural log of four x minus three and the derivative of four x minus three is four now let's confirm the answer let's find the derivative of this expression so if we were to differentiate 1 4 natural log 4x minus 3 will we get the original answer the original problem i mean to differentiate the natural log of u it's equal to u prime over u so in this case u is 4x minus 3 and u prime is four so this is gonna be one fourth and then u prime over u so four over four x minus three and the derivative of a constant is going to be zero so in this case the fours will cancel and so this will give us the original problem one over four x minus three and so it works let's try one more example what is the antiderivative of seven over three x minus eight times dx so what i'm going to do is move the constant seven to the front and then apply the same process in the last problem so u is going to be 3x minus 8. so then this is going to be 7 times ln of u or ln of 3x minus 8 divided by the derivative of 3x minus 8 which is 3 plus c so the final answer is going to be 7 over 3 natural log 3x minus 8 plus c so that's it and let's confirm it with differentiation so let's find the derivative of this expression so it's going to be seven thirds times the derivative of ln three x minus eight and the derivative of c is zero so in this case once again we need to apply this formula the derivative of ln u is u prime over u so we can see u is the stuff inside of the natural log function so that's three x minus eight which means u prime is three so it's going to be 7 over 3 times u prime over u 3 over 3x minus 8 plus 0. and we can see that the 3s will cancel giving us the original problem of 7 over x minus eight so that's how you can confirm it you 

Transcript for: Basic Integration Formulas - Calculus
in today's video I'm going to give you a list of basic integration formulas that will be helpful for you for those who are taking Calculus 1 and even uh the beginning portions of calculus 2 so here's the first one the integral of a DX is equal to ax + C now I'm going to show you how to use some of these formulas not all because there's a lot of integration formulas out there so a is a constant let's say if you want to integrate the constant 5 is simply going to be 5x + c e is a constant so e without the X this is just going to be e * x + C -7 is a constant so the integral of7 DX will be -7x + C so that's how you can use the first Formula now the next one which is associated with the power rule is this when you have a variable raised to the constant n the anti-derivative of X the N will be x n + 1 / n +1 + C so here's an example let's say if you want to find the anti-derivative of x^2 simply add 1 to two which is three and then divide by that result let's say if you want to find the anti-derivative of X Cub + 5 x 6 so for X Cub it's going to be add 1 to the exponent divide by that result so x 4 over 4 and then for x 6 is just X 7 over 7 and then plus C so that's how you can use this formula by the way for the first example that formula works as well if you see it this way five is the same as 5 * x 0 because anything raised to the zero power is one so when you add one and then divide by one you're going to end up with 5x now here's the next Formula to know the anti-derivative of a x + B raised to the N it's going to be 1/ a time ax plus b basically using the power rule on this raised to the n + 1 over n +1 + C so let's put this into practice let's say if I have 5x raised to the 7th power the 1 / a represents the derivative of what's inside the derivative of a x + B is is just a the derivative of 5x is 5 so a is going to be five then we're going to have the original expression 5x we're going to add 1 to 7 so n + 1 that's 8 and then we're going to divide by that result and then plus C so this is going to be 5x to the 8th power over 40 plus c all right here's another example let's say we have 3x + 7 rais to the 4th power so we can see that a the number in front of X is three so it's going to be 1 over 3 and then times the original expression 3x + 7 but we're going to add one to four so that's going to be five and then divide by that result so now we can write this as 3 * 5 1 15 3x + 7 rais to the 5th power by the way for those of you who want a print out of all these formulas check out the links in the description section below I'm going to post the formula sheet that's going to contain all these all of the formulas that you'll see here now whenever you want to integrate rational functions um of degree 1 one in the denominator like this you're going to get the natural log function the anti-derivative of 1 /x is Ln X keep in mind the derivative of Ln U is U Prime over U so the anti-derivative of this will give you Ln U so if you want to write that as a formula you could see it this way another similar version to the first one is this 1 over ax + B very similar to 1 /x this is 1 / a Ln ax + b so let's say if I have 1 over 3x for this one you really don't need to use the formula you can move out the three to the front and this is just 1/3 and this part is going to give you Ln X so it's 1/3 Ln X plus C now if you had a problem that looks like this let's say 1 over 4x + 5 then this formula will be very helpful a we can see is four so it's 1/4 in this case a was three in this problem and then it's going to be the natural log of what we started with on the denominator and then plus C so 1/4 Ln 4x + 5 plus C so that's how you could use uh this formula now let's move on to the integration of exponential functions so the integral of e to X DX is just e to X now the integral of e to the ax + B it's similar but with a few differences it's going to be 1 / a e to the ax + B + C so I'm going to give you a few examples the integral of e rais to the 3x is going to be a is 3 so it's 1/3 e to 3x + C the integral of e to the 5x + 2 a is 5 so it's going to be 1/5 e to the 5x + 2 and then plus C so that's how you could find the anti-derivative of exponential functions with the base e now sometimes you may have an exponential function that doesn't have the base e so let's use a instead so a raised to the BX + D we need to save C for the constant at the end so it's going to be 1 over B and then times a to the BX + D but it's it's going to be divided by LNA a so I'm going to rewrite it differently so it's what you started with before a raised to BX plus d now instead of 1 over B I'm just going to put B on the bottom but you also need to multiply by Ln a for the previous equation Ln e is 1 so that's why you don't see it there but Ln a is not one so you need to put it there so that's the formula to find the anti derivative for an exponential function when the base is not e so let's say we have 4 raised to 3x in this case b is three a is 4 so we're going to start with the original problem on top 4 ra to 3x / B which is 3 and then Ln a a is 4 and then plus C so now let's say we have 7 raised to the 2X x + 5 so we're going to have the original problem on top 7 raed to 2x + 5 divid b is 2 in this example a is 7 so it's 2 Ln 7 plus C so that's how you can find the anti-derivative of exponential functions now if you need to integrate a log expression you could use this formula the integral of log base D ax + B DX it's going to be ax + B over a Time log base D absolute value ax + B now this e is not is the constant 2.718 it's that special e number and then plus C now I created a video on this about how to use this formula so I won't put any examples in this particular video instead I'll post a link in the description section below where you can see how to use this formula and how to confirm your answer with from from correctly with integration by parts but feel free to take a look at that video if you want you can also find on YouTube if you type in integration of logs organic chemistry tutor in a search bar and that video should also come up as well but that's how you can integrate logs directly using that formula now the integral of sinx DX is cosine x + C the integral of sin a x + B DX is cosine ax + B / a + C so if we want to find the anti-derivative of sin 6x it's just going to be cosine 6X / a a is 6 and then plus C likewise if we want to find the integral of sin 9x + 4 it's going to be negative cosine of what's inside 9x + 4 / a a being 9 plus C so the anti-derivative of cosine X this is sinx + C the anti-derivative of cosine ax + B like s this is going to be S positive sign not negative sign ax plus b / A+ C now this transformation it works for the other trig functions like secant tangent cosecant and coent so if you remember the base formulas you could remember uh that variation the integral of cosecant Cent this is cose X+ C the integral of secant tangent is positive secant x plus c the integral of tangent is Ln SEC x + C now this is also equal to Ln cine x + C this a ne1 here if you move the1 to the exponent of cosine it becomes 1 / cosine which is secant x so that's why you can write this equation in both forms now very similar to tangent the integral of coent is going to be Ln sinx + C but you can also write it as Ln cose X+ C using the reciprocal function the integral of secant x is going to be Ln secant x plus tangent X by the way I have videos on YouTube where if you type in the integral of SEC x on a YouTube search bar there's a video that will explain how to go from here to there using certain integration techniques you can also find those videos on my website video- t.net where you can get access to all of my playlists like my algebra trig calculus chemistry physics playlists and when you search that playlist you should be able to find this video now the integral of cosecant X is Ln cosecant x minus cotangent X now when you're doing integration by parts you can use this formula this comes from you can derive this formula from the derivative of the product rule the integral of udv is UV minus the integral of VD I have a lot of videos that explain how to use this formula so I won't cover in this video now for the Triple integration by parts formula is this it's u v DW is equal to uvw minus the integral of V W du minus integral UW DV I also have a video explain how to use that formula too now there's a lot of other formulas to cover it'll be too much to cover it all in this video but there's the reduction formulas inverse trig there's related formulas to inverse trig as well and then you have the table of integrals which contain even more formulas there's also trig substitution as well I'm going to post all of that in the formula sheet so feel free to take a look at the formula sheet if you want those additional formulas as well but I'm going to stop it here and thanks for watching

in this video we're going to focus on integrating polynomial functions and just some basic functions in general so what is the anti-derivative of 3x minus x to the fourth go ahead and try this problem now we could use the power rule the anti-derivative of x to the n is going to be x raised to the n plus one divided by n plus one plus c so this is three x to the first power and if you want to you could separate it into two separate integrals you don't have to do this but you could do it if you want to so the antiderivative of x is x squared divided by two but multiplied by three and for x to the fourth it's going to be x to the fifth over five plus some constant c and so that's it for the first example and let's try some other problems so go ahead and determine the antiderivative of 6x squared plus the square root of x now the first thing i would recommend doing is rewriting the expression the square root of x is x to the one half now let's use the power rule so first let's determine the antiderivative of x squared it's x cubed divided by three and four x to the one half one half plus one is one point five or three over two and instead of dividing it by three over two you can multiply by two over three one divided by three over two is the same as two over three now we can simplify six divided by three is two so the final answer is two x cubed times two thirds x raised to the three halves plus c and so that's it for this problem now let's find the indefinite integral of this expression x plus 5 times 2x minus 3. so what do you think we need to do for this problem well we can't use like a product rule for integration if you see a problem like this it's best to foil before you integrate so x times 2x that's going to be 2x squared and then x times negative 3 we have negative 3x and then 5 times 2x is 10x and then 5 times negative 3 is negative 15. and now let's combine like terms so negative 3x plus 10x that's going to be 7 x so this is what we now have so now we can find the anti-derivative the anti-derivative of 2x squared is 2x to the third power divided by 3 and for x to the first power it's going to be x squared over 2 and if you find the anti-derivative of any constant it's always going to be just add an x in front of it so the anti-derivative of negative 15 is negative 15 x and then plus c and that's it for this problem try this problem go ahead and find the antiderivative of three x plus four squared now you don't want to integrate it in this form instead you want to foil three x plus four so this is equivalent to three x plus four times another three x plus four so 3x times 3x that's 9x squared and then we have 3x times 4 which is 12x and 4 times 3x that's also 12x and then 4 times 4 which is 16. now let's combine like terms 12 plus 12 is twenty four so we now have nine x squared plus twenty four x plus sixteen so now we can find the anti-derivative so for x squared it's going to be x cubed over 3 and 4 x to the first power is going to become x squared over 2 and the antiderivative of a constant like 16 is just 16x and don't forget to add c the constant of integration now let's simplify what we have so the final answer is going to be 9 divided by 3 which is 3 24 divided by 2 is 12 plus 16x plus c and so this is the answer now what if you're given a fraction for instance let's say if we have x to the fifth power plus 4x cubed minus 5x all divided by x squared how can we integrate this particular function now the first thing you should do is divide every term in the numerator by x squared this works if this is a monomial if there's only one term in the denominator and so you want to separate it into three fractions and then you want to integrate the expression so x to the fifth divided by x squared 5 minus 2 is 3 so that becomes x cubed and then 4x cubed divided by x squared that's 4x and then 5x over x squared x squared you can see it as x times x so you can cancel the next variable and so you're left with 5 over x with the negative sign as well now before we integrate because we have a rational function we need to rewrite the expression so let's move the x variable to the top so it's going to change from x to the positive one to x raised to the negative one so we have x cubed plus four x to the first power minus five x raised to the negative one power actually you know what we don't need to do that i take that back i'm gonna leave it as one over x the reason for this is because the anti-derivative of one over x is the natural log of x and that's something that you should keep in mind so the anti-derivative of x cubed is going to be x to the fourth over four and for four x is going to be four x squared over two and then minus five times the natural log of x plus c so we can write the final answer as one-fourth x to the four four divided by two is two and this is it minus 5 ln x plus c now let's work on finding the indefinite integral of trigonometric functions what is the antiderivative of 1 plus tangent squared x dx so go ahead and take a minute and try that problem now this is one of the pythagorean identities that you need to be familiar with 1 plus tangent squared is equal to something and that something is secant squared now what is the antiderivative of secant squared the derivative of which trigonometric function is secant squared the antiderivative of secant squared is tangent so the answer is going to be tangent x plus c and so that's it for this problem let's try another one find the antiderivative of sine x divided by one minus sine squared go ahead and try that now you need to be familiar with another pythagorean identity and that is sine squared plus cosine squared is equal to one so if we take this term and move it to that side we can see that cosine squared is equal to 1 minus sine squared so we can rewrite this expression as sine divided by cosine squared so how does this help us what can we do with this what we need to do at this point is expand cosine squared cosine squared is basically cosine times cosine so i'm going to write this as sine x over cosine x times 1 over cosine x now what is sine divided by cosine sine divided by cosine is tangent and one over cosine is secant the derivative of what function is secant tangent the derivative of secant is secant tangent so the antiderivative of secant tangent is secant so the final answer is secant plus c so you need to review the trigonometric functions and some of the identities need to know the reciprocal identities and the pythagorean identities and i have a playlist on trigonometry if you want to look at that so you can find that at my channel so that's it for this video thanks for watching you

in this video we're going to focus on evaluating the definite integral but first what is the difference between an indefinite integral and the definite integral so on the left i have an indefinite integral and on the right i have a definite integral the difference is a definite integral containing the lower limit a and the upper limit b those are known as the limits of integration the indefinite integral doesn't happen now once you integrate the indefinite integral it's going to give you a function in terms of x based on this example so this will give you the anti-derivative of lowercase f which is capital f plus c when you integrate the definite integral you're going to get a number maybe like 25 or something so it gives you a specific value f of x is known as the integrand dx is the variable of integration and this is the integral sign which represents a limit of sums now you need to be familiar with the fundamental theorem of calculus part two and it's associated with definite integrals basically the definite integral of f from a to b is equal to f of b minus f of a where capital f is the anti-derivative of lowercase f now this symbol if you see it is the same as f of b minus f of a so let's go ahead and apply ftc part two the second part of the fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate definite integrals so let's start with a simple problem let's evaluate eight dx from two to five so first we need to find the anti-derivative of eight the anti-derivative of eight is eight x because the derivative of eight x is eight and we're going to evaluate it from two to five so first let's replace x with five this represents f of b or basically f of five and then we're going to replace x with two so this is the f of a part now 8 times 5 is 40 and 8 times 2 is 16 40 minus 16 is 24. so the final answer of any definite integral is a number and that's it for the first example now let's try another problem go ahead and evaluate this particular definite integral feel free to pause the video if you want to so first let's find the anti-derivative of five x minus four so we need to use the power rule the anti-derivative of x raised to the n is x raised to the n plus one divided by n plus one now anytime you have an indefinite integral you're going to get some constant c when you have a definite integral you don't need the constant of integration it's going to cancel so the antiderivative of 5x is going to be 5 x squared divided by two and for negative four it's going to be negative four x now let's see what would happen if we add c which we really don't need to but let's just see what's going to happen so first we need to calculate f of b so we need to plug in 4 into this entire expression so it's going to be 5 times 4 squared divided by 2 minus 4x or 4 times 4 plus c and then minus now f of a so we got to plug in 1 this time so it's going to be 5 times 1 squared over 2 minus 4 times 1 plus c now you can see why c is about to cancel it doesn't have an x variable attached to it 4 squared is 16 16 divided by 2 is 8. 8 times five is forty four times four is sixteen and then on the right side we have one squared times five over two so that's five over two and don't forget to distribute the negative sign to everything on the right and then we have negative 4 times 1 that's negative 4 times the negative sign so that's going to be positive 4 and then we're going to have negative c so c and negative c will cancel that's why it's not needed 40 minus 16 that's going to be 24 and 24 plus 4 is 28 now 5 over two i can break that into four over two minus a half because negative four minus one is negative five and four divided by two is two so i have 28 minus two which is 26 and so i have 26 minus a half so as a mixed number that's going to be 25 and one half or 25.5 as an improper fraction is going to be 25 times 2 which is 50 plus 1 and keep the denominator the same so it's going to be 51 over 2. so this is the final answer for this problem let's work on this one go ahead and integrate this function from negative three to four so the first thing we need to do is rewrite the expression so let's take the x variable and move it to the top before we integrate it so we have 8 x to the negative 3 dx so now let's find the anti-derivative of this expression using a power rule so negative 3 plus 1 that's going to be negative 2 and then we need to divide by it and then let's evaluate this from negative 3 to 4. but before we do that let's simplify and rewrite this expression so 8 divided by negative 2 that's going to be negative 4 and then we could take the x variable and move it back to the bottom so it's going to change from x raised to the negative 2 to x raised to the positive 2. and so now we can plug in four and three so let's start with the top one the upper limit so it's going to be negative four over four squared so that's f of b and then minus f of a that's going to be negative four over negative three squared so negative four over four squared we can cancel a four so we're left with negative one over four on the right side these two negative signs will cancel and so that's gonna be positive four on top negative three squared is positive nine so now we need to add these two fractions so what we need to do is get common denominators so a common denominator between 4 and 9 is going to be 36. so we're going to multiply the second fraction by 4 over 4 and the first one by 9 over 9. so this is going to be negative 9 over thirty six plus sixteen over thirty six sixteen minus nine is seven so the final answer is seven divided by thirty six and that's the answer try this example evaluate the definite integral from 1 to e of 5 divided by x dx so first let's rewrite it as 5 and times 1 over x i'm going to move the constant to the front now what is the anti-derivative of 1 over x dx if you recall that's ln x so what we have is 5 times ln x evaluated from 1 to e so f b is going to be 5 ln e and then minus f of a which is 5 ln 1. now i need to know that the natural log of e is one and the natural log of one is zero so the final answer is simply five and that's it for this problem it's not too difficult let's try one more problem let's find the value of this definite integral go ahead and try this so first we need to rewrite the expression the square root of x is the same as x to the one-half next we need to move x to the top so this is going to be x raised to the negative one-half and now we can use the power rule so negative one-half plus one that's going to be positive one-half now and then we need to divide by one-half but if you multiply the top and bottom by two two times a half is one so this whole expression becomes two x to the one half evaluated from four to nine and then we can convert it back into the square root symbol so f of b is going to be 2 times the square root of 9 minus f of a which is 2 times the square root of 4. the square root of nine is three and the square root of four is two two times three is six two times two is four six minus four is two and that's the final answer you 

Transcript for: Calculus - Definite Integrals
in this video we're going to talk about how to evaluate definite integrals now before we begin take a minute to hit that subscribe button and don't forget to turn on the notification bell so let's talk about the difference between a definite integral and an indefinite integral a definite integral has a lower limit of integration in this case a and b the upper limit of integration an indefinite integral does not have that so this is an indefinite integral and this here is a definite integral the antiderivative of a function f of x is capital f to evaluate the definite integral once you find the antiderivative you need to plug in the limits of integration and so the the value of the definite integral is going to be f of b minus f of a but let me show you the process by which we can evaluate a definite integral so let's start with this example we need to find the antiderivative of each term in this expression what is the antiderivative of 8x cubed well let me give you a review first the antiderivative of a variable raised to a constant is going to equal that variable raised to the constant plus 1 divided by n plus 1. now for indefinite integrals we would have the constant of integration c but when dealing with definite integrals you don't need to worry about c so as an example let's say if we want to find the anti-derivative of x to the fifth all we need to do is add one to the exponent it's going to be x to the sixth and then divide by that result so let's say if we want to determine the antiderivative of 4 x to the 7th so we have a constant times x to the 7th first rewrite the constant and then find the antiderivative of x to the seventh so add one to seven that's eight and then divide by that number and after that you can reduce it so eight is four times two we can cancel the four and so the answer is going to be x to the eight over two so that's how you could find the antiderivative of monomials now let's continue on with this example so to find the anti-derivative of 8x cubed first we're going to rewrite the constant eight then we're going to add one to the exponent three plus one is four and then we're going to divide by 4. now let's repeat this process for the next one so the antiderivative of 3x squared is going to be the constant 3 times x raised to the third power divided by three now what about the anti-derivative of six times x if you don't see a number it's always a one this is six times x to the first power so just like before we're going to rewrite the constant 6 and then the variable add 1 to the exponent 1 plus 1 is 2 and then divide by that result now as was mentioned before because we're dealing with a definite integral we don't need to write the constant c here but we do need to write our limits of integration so now let's simplify this expression 8 divided by four is two so we have two times x to the fourth three divided by three is one so that cancels so we have one x cubed which we can write as just x cubed six divided by two is three so then this is going to be plus three x squared evaluated from two to three now this is going to equal f of three minus f of two and keep in mind this expression here represents lowercase f of x and this expression is the antiderivative which represents capital f of x so we're going to plug in 3 and 2 into capital f of x so in this in these brackets we're going to put f of 3 and here this is going to be f of 2. so let's plug in 3 into this expression so it's going to be 2 times 3 raised to the fourth power plus 3 raised to the third power plus 3 times 3 squared now let's substitute x with two in the second set of brackets so we have two times two to the fourth power plus two to the third plus 3 times 2 squared so this is f of 3 and this here is f of 2. so at this point we just need to do the math three to the fourth power is eighty-one and eighty-one times two is one sixty-two three to the third is twenty-seven three squared is nine times three that's twenty-seven as well two to the fourth power if you multiply four twos you're going to get sixteen and sixteen times two is thirty two two to the third power is eight two squared is four times three that's twelve 27 plus 27 we no longer need the brackets anymore 27 plus 27 is 54. 32 plus 8 is 40 and 40 plus 12 is 52 so this is minus 52 54 minus 52 is 2 162 plus 2 is 164. so this is the value of the definite integral now this value here 164 represents the area under the curve that is between the curve represented by that function and the x-axis between the x-values 2 and 3. so that's what the definite integral can do it can help you calculate the area under the curve but that's the topic for another discussion for those of you who want more examples on evaluating definite integrals check out the description section of this video i'm going to post some links there if you wish to find more examples even harder examples including square roots and other stuff so feel free to take a look at that and if you haven't done so already don't forget to subscribe to this channel and click on that notification bell thanks again for watching 

Transcript for: Properties of Definite Integrals - Basic Overview
in this video we're going to review some basic properties of integrals so let's say if we have this particular function let's say the anti-derivative or the integral of f ofx DX from 1 to 3 let's say that it's equal to five so knowing that what is the value of this particular expression so notice we have a two in front this would be the same as if we have a two between the integral symbol and F ofx it's just going to be 2 * 5 which is 10 that was pretty straightforward now what about this example let's say if the numbers were reversed instead of 1 to three it's 3: one what is the answer for this one now this this expression is equivalent to 13 F ofx DX so therefore it's 5 now what about this example what is the anti-derivative of f ofx DX from 3 to 3 this is equivalent to F of 3 minus F of three which are the same so they're going to cancel this is going to be zero whenever these two are the same the answer is always zero now what about let's say if we have a different problem let's say the integral of f ofx DX from 2 to 3 is equal to 4 and the integral of f ofx DX from 3 to 5 is equal to S if that's the case what is the integral from 2 to 5 how can we figure this value now let's analyze it graphically let's say f ofx is some function and let's say this is two three and five this particular value represents the area of the Shaded region between two and three so this region has an area of four now this integral represents the area of the Shaded region between 3 and 5 which has the value of seven now this integral represents the area of the Shaded region between two and five so it's the sum of four and seven which is 11 let's go back to that problem now it's important for you to understand that the integration from 2 to 3 plus the integral of the function from 3 to 5 is equal to the integral from 2 to 5 another way that can help you to understand it is to realize what these values represent the integration from 2 to 3 is basically the same as F of 3 minus F of 2 it's the net change of the integral function the integral of f ofx DX from 3 to 5 is the same as F of 5 minus F of3 so notice that these two they cancel one is positive and the other is negative and this expression is equal to F of 5 minus F of 2 these two values are positive and these two values are negative as you can see the left side is the same as the right side now given these two values evaluate this expression the integral from 5 to 3 F ofx DX minus the integral 3: 2 F ofx DX now if 3: 5 represents 7 5 to 3 will be -7 and if 2: 3 gives us a value of 4 3 to 2 is going to be4 so this is the same as -7 + 4 4 which is equal to -3 let's say that the integral of G ofx DX is equal to8 and the integral of GX from 3 to 9 is equal to 5 what is the value of the integration of G of x from 6 to 9 so first write an expression that relates all of these three integrals to each other you need to realize that the total is from 3 to 9 3: 6 plus the interval from 6 to 9 must add up to 3 to 9 realizing that we can write an equation the integration from 3 to 6 plus the area from 6 to 9 must equal the area from 3 to 9 that represents the total area in the interval 3 to 9 so from 3 to 6 the value is8 we're looking for this value let's call it x 3 to 9 is five so we're solving for x to do that we need to add eight to both sides so the Miss side is 5 + 8 or which is 133 so that's the answer to the problem let's try a few more examples let's say that the anti-derivative from 1 to 4 F ofx DX is 9 and from let's say 7 to 9 F ofx DX is equal to -6 go ahead head and evaluate this expression -3 * the integration from 7 to 4 F ofx DX so using the information given to you on the top go ahead and find a value of this expression so first let's write a relationship or an equation the area of the function from 1 to 4 plus the area of the function from 4 to 7 has to equal the area of the function from 1 to 7 so this we know to be true so from 1 to 4 the value is9 we need to find this one so let's call it X and from 1 to 7 it's -6 so to solve for x we need to add 9 to both sides so X is equal to -6 + 9 which is POS 3 so now we know that the integration from 4 to 7 for f ofx DX is equal to POS 3 and it makes sense -9 + 3 adds up to the total of -6 so therefore the integration from 7 to 4 must be -3 and if we multiply it by -3 then this is going to equal POS 9 So This Is The Answer let's say that the integral from 5 to 2 F ofx DX is equal to 8 and also the integral from1 to 5 F ofx DX is = to 12 so given this information find the value of this expression 5 * the integral from 2 to1 F ofx DX so let's make an interval the lowest x value that we see is NE 1 and the highest is five and the middle value is two so the first value going from left to right must be from -1 to 2 so the integral from 1 to 2 F ofx DX plus the second part the integral from 2 to 5 F ofx DX must equal the total from -1 to 5 F ofx DX so we have the total this particular value is 12 now we don't have 2 to 5 we have 5 to two if from 5 to two is 8 then 2 to 5 must be8 so we need to find this particular value so we need to add eight to both sides 12 + 8 is 20 so X is 20 so the integral from -1 to 2 F ofx DX is equal to 20 so with that information we can now find the value of this expression so from 1 to 2 it's 20 so from 2 to 1 it must be -20 * 5 this is going to be -00 so that's the answer 

Transcript for: Riemann Sums - Left Endpoints and Right Endpoints
now let's say if we have the graph of y = x^2 now let's focus on the right side of the graph how can we calculate the area under the curve from let's say 0 to a so how can we determine the area of the Shader region now one simple way in which we could do so is by using rectangles so let's use rectangles let's actually use four rectangles to approximate the area and there's two ways you can do so you could use a lower sum in this case which will be the left end points or an upper sum which would represent the right end points for an increase in function so if we're going to use four rectangles n is equal to four and so we're going to break this up into four sub intervals Now using the left end points the first rectangle is going to be at zero so it doesn't have any height the second rectangle when X is two is going to touch the curve and then the next one when X is four is going to touch the curve and looks like that and and then when X is 6 and you can see this is going to be an under approximation it's less than the actual area under the curve now to calculate the area of each rectangle we need to multiply the width of each rectangle by the height so we can see that the width is the same but the height will vary and we need to do it for every rectangle in this picture so we could come up with a process that will help us to do so so the area under the curve is equal to it's going to be the width of each rectangle that's uh Delta X which we could see that Delta X is 2 times the height the height is basically the Y values or the function values at some particular sample point the Sigma notation tells us that we need to find the sum starting from 1 to n where n is 4 so basically we have to find the sum of the area of each rectangle so Delta X represents the width of the rectangle and F ofx represents the height of the rectangle so the width times the height will give us the area Delta X is equal to B minus a / n now a is basically the first point that we see here on the left side so a is zero B represents the last point so B is eight so we want to find the area from0 to a that is from A to B so Delta X is going to be b - a 8 - 0 and we have four rectangles or four sub intervals so n is four 8 / 4 is 2 and we can clearly see that Delta X is two units long now if we wish to calculate the area of each rectangle so when x is0 0 S is0 the height is zero when X is 2 the height is going to be 2^ squ so that's 4 when X is 4 the height is going to be 4 S or 16 and then when X is 6 the height is going to be 6 squ 36 so width time height the width for each rectangle is two 2 * 4 that will give us an area of eight for the second rectangle for the third one 2 * 16 is 32 and for the last one 2 * 36 is 72 now 8 + 32 is 40 40 + 72 is 112 so we should get an area of 112 but let's come up with a process that can help us to do so efficiently without actually drawing a picture so the area using the left end point is going to be Delta x times the sum of all the Y values so we only have four sub intervals so we need to add four y values so this is going to be the first one x sub one plus the second one x sub 2 plus The Third One X sub3 and the fourth One X sub4 so what are these X values how can we find these X values well let's create a number line from A to B so from zero to 8 and there's four sub intervals which means there going to be five points so this is the first sub interval this is the second third and fourth now we need to use four of the Five Points since we're using the left end points let's start with the left side so the Four Points we're going to use is zero 2 4 and six so then the area using the left end points is going to be Delta X which is 2times f of0 plus F of 2 plus F of 4 plus F of 6 now F of 0 that's going to be 0 squar so that's 0 f of 2 is 2^ 2 which is 4 and F of 4 is 4 2 that's 16 and F of 6 is 62 which is 36 don't forget the function is y = x^2 so f ofx is X2 now 4 + 16 is 20 20 + 36 is 56 and 2 * 56 is 112 So This is the approximation of the area using the left end point now keep in mind this is an underapproximation since we have all of this empty space unus so the real answer is going to be greater than 112 now let's approximate the area using the right end points so first let's draw a picture and so we're going from0 to 8 let's make four intervals now when drawn the left end points we started with the left point and went to the right so at the left end point we made sure that that point touched the curve and then we drew a line to the right so at four you draw a line from four to the curve and then to draw the rectangle go to the right so at six draw a line from six to the curve and then go to the right so that's how you can show the rectangles using the left end points now for the right end points what you want to do is start with the right end point touch the curve and then go to the left so for six you want to start where six touches the curve and then go to the left so at four you start where four touches the curve and then go to the left so you can see that this is going to be an over approximation so the answer that we get using the right end point is going to exceed the actual area under the curve so this is known as an over approximation or an upper sum using the left end points we got an under approximation or a lower sum now for the right end points we're going to choose four of the Five Points so we're going to choose the four points on the right so that's 2 4 6 and 8 we're not going to choose the point on the left which is zero and that's going to give us the over approximation so the area using the right end points is going to be Delta X time the sum of all the heights of the rectangles so that's going to be F of 2 plus F of 4 plus F of 6 Plus F of 8 so Delta X is 2 2 2 is 4 4 2 is 16 6 2 is 36 8^2 is 64 now from the last example we know that 4 + 16 + 36 is 56 56 + 64 is 120 and 2 * 120 is 240 so this is the area that we get using the right end points when n is four now let's go ahead and average the left and the right end points the area for those values so the area for the left end points we said was 112 and for the right it's 240 so let's add them up and divide by two 112 ID 2 is 56 240 ID 2 is 120 56 + 120 is 176 so when you average the left and the right end points you're going to get an answer that's closer to the real answer now to to get the real answer we need to calculate the definite integral the area under the curve from 0 to 8 for f ofx where F ofx is X squ is going to be the integration from A to B F ofx DX in this case it's going to be from 0 to 8 X2 DX and that's going to give us the exact answer for the area under the Curve so we just got to evaluate the definite integral the anti-derivative of x^2 is X Cub over 3 evaluated from 0 to 8 so this is going to be 8 3 over 3 minus 0 3r over 3 8 * 8 is 64 and 64 * 8 is 512 so it's 512 ID 3 which is approximately 17067 so as you can see the average and the actual answer are very close the left end point which is 112 it's much less than the actual answer and the right end point 240 is much higher than the actual answer but if you average them you can get a good approximation for the area under the curve now what's going to happen if we increase the number of rectangles from four to8 what's going to happen to the accuracy of our answer if you increase the value of n the area using the left end points and the right end points the REM and sums it's going to be more accurate it's going to be closer to 170. 67 as n increases as n approaches Infinity then the r sums approximation will become equal to the actual area so let's go ahead and get the answer so let's calculate the area using the left end points so let's make a number line so from A to B that's from 0 to 8 we need eight sub intervals so we can see that the width of each rectangle is going to be one so to calculate Delta X it's going to be b - a/ n so B is the last point in the number line that's eight a is the first one and N is 8 so 8id by 8 is one now which points should we use to calculate the area using the left end points there's a total of nine points we need to use eight so we're going to use eight points starting from the left so that's going to be from zero all the way to seven we're not going to use the last end point on the right so the area is going to be Delta x times the sum of f ofx going from in this case I guess we could say 1 to 8 but x sub one is really this number that's the first x value this is x sub 2 so x sub 8 is really 7 so just keep that in mind this is x sub 9 which we're not going to use so Delta X is one and then it's going to be the first one x sub one has a value of zero x sub 2 has a value of 1 and then x sub 8 is equal to 7 so it's going to be 0 2 + 1 2 + 2 2 which is 4 + 3 2 which is 9 4 S is 16 5 S is 25 6 s is 36 7 squ is 49 now let's go ahead and add up these values so 1 + 9 that's 10 and 4 + 16 that's 20 and then 25 + 36 20 + 30 is 50 5 + 6 is 61 and then if we add 10 and 20 that's going to be 30 60 and 40 is 100 and 9 + 1 is 10 so that's 110 so we're going to get 140 so the area using the left end points when n is 8 is 140 keep in mind when n was 4 it was 112 So 140 is closest to the true answer of 170. 67 than 112 so we could see that the left end points the area using left end points is approaching the true answer of 17.6 as it increases now let's use the right end points so first let's create a number line so from 0 to 8 we're going to use the points on the right so we're not going to use the first point on the left so we need to use eight of the nine points that we see here so to calculate the area using the right end points it's going to be Delta X which is 1 times the first one which is f of one plus the second Point F of two all the way to the last Point F of 8 so F of 1 1 2 F of 2 is 2 2 that's four and then 9 16 25 36 49 and 8 squ which is 64 so we already know that from 1 to 49 that's going to be 140 if we add up these seven values because we did that already that's going to be 40 and then plus 64 so that's 204 now let's organize the information in a table so this is going to be the area using the left end points and the area using the right end points and this is going to be the average of the area for the left and the right end points and this is going to be the actual answer so when n was four the area using the left end points was 112 and for the right end points it was 240 and when we average those two numbers it was 176 and the actual answer is 170. 67 now when n is 8 the area using the left end points is 140 using the right is 204 and then if we average those two numbers 140 divid 2 is 70 204 divid 2 is 102 so this adds to 172 so as n increases notice that the area using the left end points it's increasing towards 170 and the area using the right end points it's decreasing towards 17067 it went from 240 to 204 and notice the average comparing n = 4 and N = 8 the average is approaching 170. 67 it went from 176 to 172 so as n increases the accuracy of the approximation increases so hopefully this video gave you a good introduction into remont sums and how to approximate the area under the curve using the left end points and the right end points for 

Transcript for: Midpoint Rule & Riemann Sums
in this video we're going to go over some examples dealing with the midpoint rule so let's begin so let's say if we have the graph y equals x squared and let's graph it so it looks something like this we're just going to focus on the right side of this graph now let's determine the area under the curve from 0 to 8. let's see if we can estimate it using the midpoint rule and we're going to break it into four subintervals to calculate the length of each sub-interval you can use this formula delta x is b minus a divided by n so we want to find the area over the closed interval from zero to eight so a is zero b is eight so eight minus zero divided by four is two so the left of each sub interval is two so that's delta x by the way before watching this video i recommend watching my other video on riemann sums left endpoints and right endpoints and you could find it in my new calculus video playlist or you could search it in youtube so let's continue now what we're going to do is we're going to draw four rectangles using the midpoint rule and you need to draw the rectangles starting from the midpoint of zero and two which is here and the midpoint of two and four which is three the midpoint of four and six that's five and the midpoint of six and eight that's seven so we're going to draw a rectangle where the line intersects that point so a portion of the rectangle will be outside of the curve and a portion of it will be inside or within the curve so the midpoint rule it calculates the area of those four rectangles and it approximates the area under the curve from zero to eight now as you can see there's some parts that has not been accounted for in white and also there's some parts that have been that shouldn't be accounted for also in white and so the midpoint rule is a good approximation for estimating the area under curve compared to the area using the left endpoints and the right endpoints to calculate the area of each rectangle we need to multiply the width of the rectangle which is delta x times the height of each rectangle which is the y value that corresponds to a certain x value or you could say that's basically f x at some sample point x or x sub i the area is going to be the width which is the same for each rectangle times the height of all the rectangles so we're going to sum up the individual heights for each rectangle starting from 1 to some value n now n is 4 in this example because it's 4 rectangles we need to do is create a number line so going from a to b 0 to 8 and it's 4 sub intervals this is the first sub interval this is the second one the third and the fourth one now if you were to calculate the area using the left endpoints we need to choose four out of the five points listed so that would be zero two four and six for an increasing function that would be an under approximation or a lower sum if we were to calculate the area using the right endpoints we would use 2 4 6 and 8 so this would lead to an over approximation or an upper sum for this example but using the midpoint rule we're going to get the points in the middle of each sub interval so that's going to be at 1 3 5 and 7. so the area is going to be delta x times the sum of all of those the heights of the rectangles so it's going to be at 1 and 3 5 and 7. so it's the midpoint of each sub interval now we know that delta x is 2 and f of 1 we know that f of x is x squared for this example so this is gonna be one squared which is one three squared is nine five squared is twenty-five and this is supposed to be a seven i don't know why i put a six here seven squared is forty-nine so first let's add one and 49 one plus 49 that's going to be 50 and then 9 plus 25 is 34. 50 plus 34 is 84. and 2 times 84 is 168. so this is the area using the midpoint rule let's see how close we are to the actual answer so to calculate the actual answer the exact area under the curve is simply equal to the definite integral evaluated over that interval so it's going to be from 0 to 8 x squared dx the antiderivative of x squared using the power rule it's x cubed over three evaluated from zero to eight so this is going to be eight to the third over three minus zero to the third over three eight to the third is 5 12 and 512 divided by 3 is 170.67 so as you can see the midpoint rule is a good approximation of the actual area under the curve now let's try another example let's say we have the function x to the third and i want you to estimate the area under the curve over the closed interval zero to ten and choose five rectangles you can break down that interval into five sub intervals so go ahead and use the midpoint rule first and then calculate the definite integral from 0 to 10 to see if the answers are close to each other so let's start with a graph so x cubed has a similar shape as x squared the only difference is it rises faster so we need to calculate the area of the shaded region so let's start with the midpoint rule so let's create a number line from 0 to 10 and let's calculate delta x so delta x is going to be b minus a over n a is 0 b is 10. so this is going to be ten minus zero divided by five which is two so these numbers will differ by two now to use the midpoint rule we need to get the midpoint of each sub interval so that's at 1 3 5 7 and 9. so the area is going to equal delta x times the sum of f of x at these different values going from 1 to five so we're gonna have five values because n is five now delta x we calculate it to be two and then this is going to be times f of one plus f of three and then f of five plus f of seven plus f of nine now f of x is x cubed so this is going to be one to the third power which is one three to the third power that's 27 5 cubed five times five times five is 125 and then seven to the third power that's 343 and then 9 raised to the third power is 729 so go ahead and plug those numbers in your calculator 1 plus 27 plus 125 plus 343 plus 729 that's 1225. if you multiply that by 2 this is 2450. so that's the area using the midpoint rule that's the approximation for the area under the curve now let's get the actual area by calculating the definite integral of x cubed from 0 to 10. so the anti-derivative of x raised to the third power is going to be x to the fourth power divided by four so this is going to be ten to the fourth power over four minus zero to the fourth power over four if we multiply ten ten i mean four times ten times ten is a hundred times ten is a thousand times another ten that's going to be ten thousand so it's one with four zeros and ten thousand divided by four is twenty five hundred and so twenty four and 2500 they're pretty close to each other they're not too far apart and so as you can see the midpoint rule is a very good approximation of the area under the curve you could use it to estimate the value of a definite integral you 

Transcript for: Summation Formulas and Sigma Notation - Calculus
in this video we're going to go over the summation formulas that you need to know in calculus particularly if you want to find the area of a region so let's say if we wish to evaluate this sum so it's given to us using sigma notation so what is this equal to now there is a formula for this type of problem if you have a constant c and if i is equal to one and it goes up to n then it's going to equal the constant times n in this case we're adding eight four times so the constant is eight so therefore adding eight four times is the same as multiplying eight by four and this will give you 32. now let's work on some other examples try these two problems let's say i is one the constant is seven and this is eight and also let's say this is nine and this is five so the first one is simply going to be c times n seven times eight so that's 56 for the second example it's going to be c times n or nine times five which is forty five so that's how you can evaluate a sum if you have a constant in sigma notation now the next formula that you need to be familiar with is this one so instead of a constant we're going to have the variable i and we're going to go up to n so this is going to equal n times n plus 1 divided by 2. so let me give an example so let's say i is one and we have the variable i and let's go up to five so we need to add up all the numbers from one to five so when you replace i with one you get one if you replace with two it's going to be two and we're dealing with sum so we have to add everything up to five one plus two is three three plus three is six 6 plus 4 is 10 10 plus 5 is 15. now let's confirm that answer using the formula above so n is this top number it's five so it's going to be five times five plus one divided by two five plus one is six and six divided by two is three and five times three is fifteen so as you can see this will give you the same answer try this problem so let's say if we have six times i where i starts from one and it stops at four go ahead and evaluate the sum so when i is one six times one is six when i is 2 6 times 2 is 12 6 times 3 is 18 6 times 4 is 24 now 12 plus 18 that's 30 and 6 plus 24 is also 30. 30 plus 30 is 60. so that's the sum for this example now let's use the formula to confirm the answer so what i'm going to do is take the constant and move it to the front so what i have is 6 times the sum of i equals 1 to 4 for the variable i so it's going to be 6 times n n plus one divided by two where n is the top number four so that's going to be six times four and then four plus one all divided by two now four divided by two is two and four plus one is five two times five is ten and six times ten is 60. so in the end we get the same answer so that's how you can use the formula to evaluate that particular sum let's try another example evaluate this one so let's say if this is 7i minus 3. going from one to five go ahead and try that so if we plug in one seven times one minus three is four if we plug in two seven times two is fourteen minus 3 is 11. if we plug in 3 7 times 3 is 21 minus 3 is 18. notice that the numbers are increasing by 7. we have an arithmetic sequence but with a sum so the next number is going to be 25 and the fifth one the last one is 32. now 4 plus 11 is 15 and then if we add 18 and 32 that's going to be 50. and then 15 and 25 that's 40 40 plus 50 is 90. so the sum is 90. now let's use the summation formulas to get the same answer so i'm going to write it as 7 times the sigma notation for i going from one to five and then minus three you want to separate it into two parts so for i the formula is going to be n times n minus one divided by two and for the constant is simply c times n and the constant three so it's gonna be three times n where n is five so that's going to be seven times five and it's supposed to be plus one not minus one five plus one is six and then this is going to be three times five now i'm running out of space so i'm just gonna continue here seven times five is thirty five and six divided by two is three three times five is fifteen now thirty five times three thirty times 3 is 90 5 times 3 is 15 so 90 plus 15 that's 105 and 105 minus 15 is 90. and so you get the same answer now for the sake of practice go ahead and try this example feel free to pause the video if you want to try it let's say this is going to be 9i plus seven so this is going to be nine times the sigma notation for i going from one to five and plus the sigma notation at for seven as a constant actually supposed to be eight not five so n is eight in this example this is going to be nine times n times n plus one divided by two plus seven times n where n is eight so this is going to be 9 times 8 8 plus 1 is 9 divided by 2 and then plus 7 times 8. now 9 times 9 is 81 and eight divided by two is four and seven times eight is fifty-six eighty-one times four eighty times four is three twenty and then one times four is four so that's three twenty-four if you add fifty-six to it that's going to give you 380 which is the final answer now let's confirm it using simple addition so if we plug in one nine times one plus seven that's sixteen and then if we plug in two nine times two is eighteen plus seven that's twenty-five and then three nine times three is twenty-seven plus seven thirty-four so it's going up by nine the next one's gonna be 43 that's the fourth number and then 52 and then 61 and then 70. so we have seven numbers now the last one nine times eight is 72 plus 779 so let's use a calculator for this so if we add 16 25 34 43 52 61 70 and 77 i mean that's 77 but 79 this will give us 380 so we get the exact same answer now let's move on to the next formula and it's this time i squared instead of i it's equal to n times n plus one times two n plus one divided by six so let's confirm that with an example so let's say if we have i squared and we wish to go up to six this is going to be one squared plus two squared plus three squared plus four squared plus five squared plus six squared so one squared is one two squared is four three squared is nine four squared is sixteen five squared is twenty-five six squared is thirty-six now if we add one plus nine that's going to give us ten and then if we add four and 16. that's going to give us a nice number that's 20. and 25 and 36 20 and 30 is 50 5 and 6 is 11 so that's going to be 61. 10 plus 20 is 30 plus 61 that's 91. now let's get the same answer using that formula so let's erase this so n is six n plus one that's going to be seven and then two n plus one two times six is twelve plus one that's thirteen divided by six so we could cancel six and then seven times thirteen seven times ten is seventy seven times three is twenty one seventy and twenty one gives us ninety one so this example confirms this formula now the last formula that we need to talk about is i to the third power so it's going to be n squared times n plus 1 squared divided by 4. so let's use an example and let's say n is four let's keep it simple so this is gonna be one to the third plus two to the third plus three to the third plus four to the third power so two to the third is eight three cubed is twenty-seven four q is sixty-four so 1 plus 8 plus 27 plus 64. that's equal to 100. now let's see if we can get the same answer using this formula so i'm going to work it right here so n is 4 that's going to be 4 squared and 4 plus 1 is 5 divided by 4. so we can cancel a 4 leaving 1 4 on top 5 squared is 25 and four times twenty five is a hundred so this is the formula for i to the third if you ever need to use it now let's work on a few practice examples so let's say if we have i times i squared plus 4i go ahead and try this now the first thing i recommend doing is to distribute the i to i squared plus 4i so this is going to be i to the third power and then i times 4i that's 4i squared and then we could separate it into two separate sums so the first one is just i to the third power and for the second one it's going to be plus 4 times i squared now the formula for i to the third power is going to be n squared times n plus one squared over four and then for the second one it's going to be four times the formula for i squared which is n n plus one times two n plus one divided by six and keep in mind n is five based on what we see here so let's plug in five this is going to be five squared and then five plus one is six on the right we have four times five five plus one is six two times five is ten plus one that's eleven divided by six so at least we could cancel a six on the right side now five squared is twenty five six times six is thirty six on the right four times five is twenty now 36 divided by 4 that's 9. and what's 20 times 11 so if you have 11 20 bills how much money do you have that's going to be and if you have nine quarters you have two dollars and 25 cents so 25 times 9 is 225 plus 220 that's going to be 445 and that's the answer now let's work on one last problem so let's say if we have i minus 1 squared from 1 to 9. go ahead and evaluate it now the first thing i would do is foil i minus 1 squared so this is i minus 1 times i minus 1. and so i times i that's going to be i squared and then we have i times negative 1 so that's negative i negative 1 times i is also negative i and then the last one is negative one times negative one which is positive one so now let's combine like terms so this becomes i squared minus two i plus one so we can rewrite the problem like this now let's separate it into three separate sums so we have i squared from one to nine and then minus two times the sum of i from one to nine and then we have a constant so now let's apply the appropriate formulas so for i squared it's going to be n times n plus 1 times 2n plus 1 divided by six and then minus two times the formula for i which is n n plus one divided by two and for the constant it's just gonna be the constant times n and keep in mind n is equal to 9 for this problem so on the left it's going to be 9 and then nine plus one is ten two times nine which is eighteen plus one that's nineteen here we could cancel the twos and so it's gonna be nine times nine plus one which is 10 and then plus n so that's 9. now 9 times 10 is 90. and on the right we also have another 9 times 10 which is 90 as well ninety divided by six is fifteen so we have fifteen times nineteen and nineteen is just twenty minus one negative 90 plus 9 or 9 minus 90 that's negative 81. now 15 times 20 is 300 and 15 times 1 is 15. so 15 times 19 is really 285 285 minus 81 is 204 and that is the final answer you 

Transcript for: Finding The Area Using The Limit Definition & Sigma Notation
in this video we're going to focus on finding the area using the limit definition so let's say if we have the function x cube and we want to find the area of the shaded region between the x-axis and the curve over the closed interval from zero to eight so let's draw a picture so x cube on the right side looks like this and so from 0 to 8 we want to find the area of the shader region how can we do so using the limit definition well you need to know the formula to calculate the area it's equal to the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum of all of the rectangles starting from 1 to n of f of x sub i times delta x delta x represents the width of the rectangle and f of x sub i is the height of the rectangle so as n becomes very large we're going to use an infinite number of rectangles to approximate the area under the curve and we're going to add the area of each rectangle we're going to sum it up and that's going to give us the area under curve which is equal to the definite integral of the function from a to b so what is x sub i and how can we find it so if you're using the right endpoints x sub i is equal to a plus a delta x times i if you're using the left endpoints x sub i is equal to a plus delta x times i minus 1. so let me illustrate the right endpoints because you can use either one to get the same answer but the right endpoints is a lot easier than the left ones so let's make a number line and let's go from zero to eight and for this particular illustration we're going to say that n is four but for the actual problem n goes to infinity so this applies only for this illustration so if n is 4 what is delta x delta x is b minus a divided by n so keep in mind a is the beginning of the interval b is the end so it's always from a to b now b is equal to eight a is zero and then n is four for this example so eight divided by four is two so the width of each sub interval is equal to two and so that's the value of delta x so now let's use the formula first let me get rid of some stuff so let's use this formula x sub i is equal to a plus delta x times i now for this example we said that n is 4 and so we're going to have x1 x2 x3 and x4 as you start from 1 and end at 4. so using the right endpoints we need to choose four of the five points listed on the number line and so we're going to use the four points on the right side two four six eight now when i is one the x value is two so we can say x sub one is two and x sub two is four let me use a different color to distinguish it from the stuff above so this is x sub one x sub two x sub three is six and x sub four is eight so if you want to calculate the value of x sub 1 using this formula for the right endpoints we start with a so keep in mind a is zero delta x we said it was eight over four which is two and i is whatever the subscript is so i is one and this is equal to two so x sub one is in d2 now if we want to calculate x sub 2 it's going to be 0 plus 2 times 2 which is 4. and if we wish to calculate x sub 4 0 plus 2 i is 4 so that's going to have a value of 8. so x sub i it tells us the value of x at some point along the number line so now let's go ahead and work on this problem so we said before that the area is the limit as n approaches infinity and we're going to sum up the area of each rectangle from 1 to n where n goes to infinity f of x sub i times delta x over the interval 0 to 8 where f of x is x cubed so let's calculate delta x let me do it on the right side so delta x is going to be b minus a so that's 8 minus 0 divided by n but in this case we don't have a specific end value because it goes to infinity so we're going to leave delta x as 8 over n the next thing we need to determine is x sub i using the right endpoints so it's a plus a delta x times i and we can see that a is equal to zero delta x is this thing over here it's eight over n times i and so this is x sub i so let's replace x sub i and delta x in that expression so the area is going to be the limit as n approaches infinity and then it's going to be f of 8 i over n times delta x which is 8 divided by n now let's evaluate the function when x is 8i over n so we need to replace x with that so we need to rewrite what we have that's the limit as n approaches infinity and don't forget the sigma notation and so this is going to be 8 i divided by n raised to the third power times eight over n now eight to the third power so that's eight times eight times eight that's five twelfth and then times another eight that's going to be 4096. this problem involves a lot of writing so we have 4096 and then we have i to the third power and then this is going to be n raised to the third power times another n so that's n to the fourth power now we need to apply the summation formula and there's another video i created entitled summation formulas and sigma notation calculus you could search it in youtube if you have trouble finding it just type in organic chemistry to it as well in the search box it should come up or you could find it in my new calculus video playlist but you need to know the summation formulas for a constant for i i squared and i cube so we're going to use the one for i cube but let's rearrange this expression so right now we have the limit as n approaches infinity 4096 over n to the fourth and then the summation formula for i to the third now don't apply the limit make sure you apply the summation formula first before you apply the limit the summation formula that corresponds to this that is i to the third going from i equal one to n it's n squared times n plus one squared divided by four so let's simplify first we could divide 4096 divided by four four thousand divided by four is a thousand and ninety-six divided by four is twenty-four so we're going to have a thousand twenty-four and then n squared divided by n to the fourth that's one over n squared so we're going to have an n squared on the bottom and on top we're left over with n plus one squared so at this point it's all math so i'm going to move the constant to the front because the limit will not affect it now i'm going to foil n plus 1 so n plus 1 times n plus one when you foil it it's going to be n squared plus two n plus one divided by n squared now i'm going to multiply the top and the bottom by one over n squared and so we're going to get this so it's going to be 1 plus two over n plus one over n squared divided by one now let's say if you have the limit as x approaches infinity for one over x one over infinity is zero or if you have this for one over x squared one over infinity squared is zero so anytime you have a fixed number divided by a very very large number you're going to get a small number and so this is going to be a thousand twenty four and now applying the limit expression two over n becomes zero so this is going to be one plus zero and one over n squared will also become zero divided by one so this is a thousand twenty four times one so the area is one thousand and twenty four this is the answer now let's confirm it by calculating the value of the definite integral of the function from a to b the area is equal to the definite integral of f of x dx from a to b so a is zero b is eight and the function is x cubed the anti-derivative of x cube is x to the fourth over four and then we're gonna evaluate it from zero to eight so this is gonna be eight to the fourth over four minus zero now eight to the fourth we know this it's four thousand ninety six and we know that four thousand ninety six divided by four is one 1024 so evaluating the definite integral is a lot faster but sometimes you may get a free response problem and you have to do so using the limit definition nevertheless you can confirm if you have the right answer by finding the value of the definite integral you 

Transcript for: Evaluating Definite Integrals Using Geometry
in this video we're gonna focus on evaluating definite integrals using geometry so what is the value of this definite integral now the first thing we need to do is graph the function so y is equal to 8 basically that's a horizontal line at 8 and we're interested in the interval from 1 to 4 so let's shade the region bounded by the line y equals 8 and the lines x equals 1 and x equals 4 the value of the definite integral is the area of the shaded region so make sure you know this the area is equal to the definite integral of f of X from A to B so basically we need to find the area of this rectangle so it has a width of 4 minus 3 which is I mean 4 minus 1 which is 3 and then the height is 8 so the area of a rectangle I have times the width so that's going to be 3 times 8 or 8 times 3 which is 24 now let's go ahead and confirm this answer by evaluating this definite integral so the antiderivative of 8 is 8 X evaluated from 1 to 4 so it's gonna be 8 times 4 minus 8 times 1 8 times 4 is 32 8 times 1 is 8 32 minus 8 is 24 so as you can see we get the same answer now let's try another example go ahead and use geometry to evaluate this definite integral so let's begin by graphing 2x from 0 to 2 so basically it's a straight line with a slope of 2 so let's say this is 0 and this is 4 now when X is 4 y which is equal to 2x that's going to have a y-value of 8 so we need to determine the area of the shaded region so basically we need to determine the area of a right triangle so we have a base of 4 and the height of 8 the area of a right triangle is 1/2 base times height so the base is 4 pi is 8 half of 4 is 2 2 times 8 is 16 so the area of the shaded region is 16 square units now let's go ahead and evaluate the definite integral let's see if we're going to get the same answer so the antiderivative of x is x squared divided by 2 let's evaluate it from 0 to 4 so 2 divided by 2 is 1 so that cancels and then if we plug in the upper limit first is going to be 4 squared and then for the lower limit minus 0 squared 4 squared is 16 16 minus 0 is 16 and so as you can see the answer is indeed the same now let's move on to number three use geometry to evaluate this integral and then confirm your answer by evaluating the definite integral so we can see that in this example y is equal to 3x plus 2 so let's begin by graphing 3x plus 2 so this is in slope-intercept form Y is equal to MX plus B and B the y-intercept is 2 so the graph is going to start at you and it's gonna have a slope of 3 so it's gonna go up at an increasing rate however we want the Y values when X is 1 and 5 so at 1 it's gonna be 3 times 1 plus 2 so the value is gonna be 5 at 0 is 2 now at 5 it's going to be 3 times 5 plus 2 which is 17 which is going to be very high but let's say and that point corresponds to 17 we just need the important points the graph doesn't have to be perfect so we need to find the area of the shaded region so how can we do that when you see a composite shape like this you need to break it down into its fundamental shapes so we can break it down into a rectangle and a triangle now what we need to do is determine the dimensions of each figure so for the rectangle 5 minus 1 is 4 so it has a whiff of 4 now we can see that it's 5 unit I this is 0-2 the rectangle it's 4 by 5 4 times 5 is 20 that's the area of the rectangle now for the triangle it has a base of 4 the same as the rectangle but the height is the difference between 17 and 5 which is 12 so 4 times 12 is 48 but half of that is 24 because of the triangle is 1/2 base times height so adding these two values 20 plus 24 this is going to equal to 44 now let's confirm it once to make sure we did everything correctly so the antiderivative of 3 X plus 2 is going to be 3 x squared divided by 2 plus 2 X evaluated from 1 to 5 so let's plug in 5 first so it's 3 times 5 squared over 2 plus 2 times 5 and then minus if we plug in 1 we'll get that five squared is 25 25 times 3 is 75 and 2 times 5 is 10 and then minus 3 over 2 and this is 2 times 1 which is 2 but there's a negative sign in front of it 75 minus 3 is 72 so we have 72 divided by 2 10 minus 2 is 8 and 72 divided by 2 is 36 36 Plus 8 is 44 so that means that we did this problem correctly let's move on to our next example let's use an absolute value function 3 minus the absolute value of x go ahead and try that so first we need to plot the function so the absolute value of X looks like this it's a v-shape and it opens upward now the absolute value for negative x it opens downward and this has been shifted up three units so we're gonna start at three and then it's gonna look like this now we want to find the value of the integral from negative two to two so we only want in this region so how can we find the area of the shaded region so what we need to do is break it up into two parts a rectangle and a triangle so what are the dimensions of the rectangle and a triangle so 2 minus negative 2 that's 4 so the base of the rectangle and the triangle is 4 now what about the height of the rectangle so what is the Y value at this point when X is 2 3 minus 2 is 1 so the Y value is 1 if you plug in negative 2 it's gonna be the same so the height of the rectangle is 1 and the height of the triangle is gonna be 3 minus 1 which is 2 so now we can calculate the area of this composite figure so 1 times 4 is 4 and for the triangle it's going to be 1/2 base times height the base of the triangle is 4 and the height is 2 half of 4 is 2 2 times 2 is 4 so we're gonna add 4 plus 4 and that gives us a total area of 8 now let's see if we can get the answer so how can we evaluate the definite integral when it has an absolute value function now going back to the graph you need to write two separate functions in order to evaluate it now the absolute value of X can equal two things it can equal positive x or it can equal negative x if you solve it on the inside because the absolute value of a negative number like let's say negative 5 is 5 and the absolute value of 5 is 5 so let's say if the absolute value of x is 8 that means that X can equal 8 or negative 8 they will both give you an output of 8 so there's two parts to this the graph the left side and the right side one side is going to be 3 minus positive x which is just 3 minus X and the other side is gonna be 3 minus negative X which is 3 plus X so you need to replace this expression with X and negative x now 3 plus X that has a positive slope so that's going to be the left side because as you go from left to right this graph is going in the upward direction so that's the graph of 3 plus X and the right side and notice it has a negative slope is going down so that's going to be the graph of 3 minus X so we need to split the integral into 2 parts for the left side and the right side now we need to go from negative 2 to 2 so from negative 2 to 0 the left side we're going to integrate 3 plus X and then from 0 2 to the right side we're going to integrate 3 minus X let me get rid of this now the antiderivative of 3 is 3x and the antiderivative of X is x squared divided by 2 evaluated from negative 2 to 0 and so we're gonna have 3x again but this time negative x squared over 2 evaluated from 0 to 2 so first let's plug in 0 3 times 0 plus 0 squared over 2 all of that is going to be 0 and then let's plug in negative 2 on the right side let's plug in 2 so we have 3 times 2 minus 2 squared over 2 and then minus if we plug in 0 everything is going to be 0 so three times negative two is negative six plus there's a negative sign in front so that's positive 6 negative 2 squared is 4 times 2 that's 2 and then with this negative sign that's going to be negative 2 and then we have 3 times 2 which is 6 and then negative 2 squared over 2 that's going to be minus 2 so 6 plus 6 is 12 4 negative 2 minus 2 is 4 12 minus 4 is 8 and so as you can see we get the same answer let's try one last problem go ahead and find the value of this definite integral now perhaps you've noticed that we can't integrate this using conventional techniques at least we can't use the techniques that we've learned so far so we need to use geometry to get the answer that's the only way now you need to be familiar with the standard equation of a circle x squared plus y squared is equal to R squared and let's solve for y so let's subtract both sides by x squared so Y squared is R squared minus x squared and if we take the square root of both sides we'll get this equation but whenever you take the square root you can have a positive answer or a negative answer now when dealing with a circle there's two parts to a circle the top half and the bottom half this equation at the beginning corresponds to the entire circle the bottom part it's below the x-axis so that's going to be negative R squared minus x squared the top part is going to be positive square root R squared minus x squared now looking at this function there's no negative sign in front of it and what do we have a plus or minus sign it's simply positive so what we have is a semicircle from negative 4 to 4 so we've got to find the area of the shaded region so we've got to find the area of half a circle as opposed to a full circle the area of a circle is PI R squared so for semicircle is going to be 1/2 PI R squared now we need to know what the radius of the circle is notice that 16 is equal to R squared so R is gonna be 4 and also you can see it here this is 4 which means this must be 4 as well so the area is going to be 1/2 pi times 4 squared 4 squared is 16 half of 16 is 8 so the area is 8 pi and so that's how you can evaluate this particular definite integral you need to realize that this function represents the shape of a semicircle not the whole circle but just the upper half and so knowing that you can use geometry to get the answer 

Transcript for: Integral of absolute value of x or abs(x)
today we're gonna talk about how to integrate the absolute value of X function now before you do so let's draw a graph of the absolute value of x and the graph looks like this so that's the function absolute value of x on the right side we have y is equal to positive x and on the left side y is equal to negative x so you can break it down this function into two parts so the absolute value of x is equal to X when X is greater than or equal to zero and it's equal to negative x on the left side when X is less than zero so thus we have the integral of two separate parts so we need to integrate X when X is greater than or equal to zero and negative x when it's a less than zero so we need to use the power rule the antiderivative of X is going to be x squared over two plus C so that's we're going to have 1/2 x squared plus C when X is equal to a greater than zero and the antiderivative of negative x is going to be negative 1/2 x squared plus C when X is less than zero and so this is the answer that's the integral of the absolute value of x 

Transcript for: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 1
in this video we're going to talk about the first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus so if g of x is equal to the definite integral of f of t from a to x then g prime of x is going to equal f of x so if g is the antiderivative of f then the derivative of g will equal f the derivative of the antiderivative will give you the original function another way in which you can express the second part of the i mean the first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus is you can express it this way the derivative of the integral from a to x of f of t dt is going to equal f of x and for the most part you're replacing t with x but that's not always the case as some examples will illustrate but that's the basic idea behind the first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus some textbooks may call it the second part of the fundamental theorem of calculus but regardless of what they call it the principle still remains the same now let's work on an example problem so let's find the derivative with respect to x of the integral from zero to x of the function the square root of t squared plus 4 dt now it's going to be difficult to integrate this function and then differentiate it so there has to be an easier way perhaps you realize that the answer is going to be f of x which is just the square root of x squared plus 4. but there's a process that you can employ to get the answer and we're going to go over that right now so f of t is going to be the function square root t squared plus 4. so what we now have is just the integration of f of t dt from 0 to x now capital f is the antiderivative of lowercase f so let's find the antiderivative it's going to be capital f of t evaluated from 0 to x and that's equal to f of x minus f of zero now the derivative of f of x that is capital f of x is going to give us lower case f of x and f of 0 is a constant the derivative of a constant is 0. so this is equal to f of x now if f of t is equal to the square root of t squared plus 4 then f of x is going to be the square root of x squared plus 4. and so this is the final answer to the entire problem now let's try another problem so let's say it's going to be the antiderivative or the integral of let's say the square root of t to the third plus five from x to four go ahead and try that feel free to pause the video so let's define f of t as being the square root of t to the third plus five and so we have this expression we can replace this with f of t the antiderivative of lowercase f we know it's capital f evaluated from x to four so then this is going to be f of 4 minus f of x now f of 4 is a constant and so its derivative will be 0. now the derivative of capital f is going to be lower case f so notice that the answer is not just f of x anymore it's negative f of x if x is in the bottom if x was on top then it would become f of x so the final answer is going to be negative square root x cubed plus five and so the answer can change so it's not always just f of x but if you go through this process you can always get the right answer here's another example so instead of x let's say it's x squared we're going to have the cube root actually let's use the square root of t to the third minus 4 dt so go ahead and try it what do you think the answer is going to be if you had to guess it well here's what you need to do if you want to do it the fast way the first thing you need to do is replace t with what you see here in this case x squared so it's going to be x squared raised to the third power minus four and then you got to multiply by the derivative of x squared based on the chain rule if it was just x the derivative of x is one so it wasn't important then but now it is so the final answer is going to be 2x times the square root of x to the 6 minus 4. now let's confirm it so i'm just going to write this answer at the bottom so let's go through that process that we've been going through so first let's define f of t so f of t is going to be the square root of t to the third minus four and so we have this expression f of t dt and the anti-derivative of lowercase f as always that's not going to change it's going to be capital f evaluated from 5 to x squared and so this is going to be f of x squared that's a terrible looking 2 minus f of 5. so what is the derivative of f of x squared well we need to use the chain rule so we need to differentiate the outside part of the function the derivative of capital f is lowercase f then we need to keep the stuff on the inside the same and then we need to find the derivative of the inside function which is 2x now this is a constant and the derivative of any constant will be zero so now f of t is equal to this so what is f of x squared we need to replace t with x squared so it's going to be x squared raised to the third power minus four so then that becomes the square root of x to the sixth minus four and then times two x so as you can see these two are the same let's try one more example and i recommend pausing the video and working on it if you can get this one right then you're okay with this topic so we're going to integrate the function from x squared to x cubed and let's say it's the square root of t to the fourth power minus 2. so go ahead and try so let's do it the easy way first we're going to plug in the top part of the integral the upper limit so it's going to be the square root of replace t with x cubed so x cubed raised to the fourth power minus two and then multiply by the derivative of x cubed so that's going to be 3x squared and then for the bottom don't forget to subtract and let's replace t with x squared it's going to be x squared raised to the 4th power minus 2 and the derivative of x squared is 2x so the final answer which i'm going to write here is going to be 3x squared square root x to the twelfth minus two and then minus two x square root x to the eighth minus two and so that's the fast way of getting the answer but let's show our work so once again we're going to define f of t as being the square root of t to the fourth minus two so now we have f of t dt and the antiderivative of lowercase f is capital f evaluated from x squared to x cubed and then this is going to be f of x cubed minus f of x squared and the derivative of the outside function capital f is lower case f keep the inside the same and then differentiate the inside function which is 3x squared and then it's going to be minus f of x squared times the derivative of x squared which is 2x so now using this function let's plug in x cubed so it's going to be the square root of x to the third raised to the fourth minus two and we can move this to the front and then it's gonna be minus two x square root x squared raised to the fourth minus two so you can see we're going to get the same final answer and so that's how you can apply the fundamental theorem of calculus part one if your textbook defines it as part one you 

Transcript for: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 2
in this video we're going to talk about the second part of the fundamental theorem of calculus now some books may call it the first part but you can go with whatever your textbook says so the basic idea is that you have a function f and it's continuous on the closed interval a b and capital f represents the anti-derivative of lowercase f so in that case then according to the fundamental theorem of calculus the definite integral of f of x that's lower case f x on the interval a to b that's equal to f of x evaluated from a to b which is f of b minus f of a so this theorem describes the process by which we can evaluate a definite integral so let's go over some examples go ahead and evaluate this particular integral feel free to pause the video if you want to try the anti-derivative of 3x using the power rule is going to be 3x to the second power divided by 2 and the anti-derivative of 4 is 4x so let's evaluate it from two to five so f of five is going to be three times five squared over two minus four times five minus f of 2 so if we plug in 2 into f of x now keep in mind this is lower case f of x and this represents the capital f x the anti-derivative of f so this is f of five minus f of two so that's going to be three times two squared over two minus four times two now 5 squared is 25 4 times 5 is 20. 2 squared is 4 divided by 2 that's 2 and 3 times 2 is 6. 4 times 2 is 8. now 3 times 25 is 75 6 minus 2 is negative 2 times this negative sign so that's a positive 2. negative 20 plus 2 is negative 18. now we need to get common denominators so this is going to be 75 over 2 minus 36 over 2 and 75 minus 36 that's going to be 39 and that's the final answer 39 divided by 2. let's work on some more examples so use the second part of the fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate the definite integral now before we could find the anti-derivative we should foil this expression so what we have is 2x minus 3 multiplied by another 2x minus 3. so first we have 2x times 2x and that's going to give us 4x squared and then it's 2x times negative 3 so that's negative 6x and negative three times two x is negative six x and then negative three times negative three that is positive nine so now what we need to do is combine like terms and this is supposed to be a 4. negative 6 minus 6 is negative 12. so this is what we now have now lowercase f is 4x squared minus 12x plus 9. now we need to find the antiderivative capital f of x now let's start at the top so the antiderivative of x squared is going to be x cubed over three and for x it's x squared over two and the antiderivative of a constant it's going to be the constant times the variable of integration which is x so this is capital f of x and we're going to evaluate it from one to four so we have now is f of x one to four and that's equal to f of four minus f of one so let's start with f of four let's plug in four into that expression so it's gonna be four times 4 raised to the third power divided by 3 and 12 divided by 2 is 6 so it's going to be 6 times 4 squared plus 9 times four and then minus f of one so one to the third is one times four over three and one squared times six is just six and then plus nine times one or nine now four to the third power that's 64 and if we multiply that by four we're going to have 256 divided by three four squared is 16 16 times 6 is 96 and 9 times 4 is 36 and then we have minus four thirds and if we distribute the negative sign plus six minus nine so the first thing we could do is combine these two fractions because they share the same denominator 256 minus 4 is 252. negative 96 plus 36 that's negative 60 and 6 minus 9 that's negative 3. now 252 divided by 3 is 84. and 60 minus well negative 16 minus 3 is negative 63 so 84 minus 63 is 21 and that is the final answer let's work on this example find a definite integral from 1 to 4 of the square root of 5 over x so what do you think we should do in this problem well first we can rewrite the expression like this it's equivalent to the square root of 5 divided by the square root of x and the square root of 5 is a constant which we can move that to the front and so this is what we now have we can rewrite the square root of x as x raised to the one half and we're not done rewriting so now we need to take the x variable move it to the top so we could use the power rule so this is x raised to the negative one-half and now we can use the power rule so negative one-half plus one is one-half and then we need to divide that by a half which if you multiply the top and bottom by two over two one half times two is one so we just put the two on top and we're going to evaluate this from 1 to 4. so what we now have is 2 square root 5 times the square root of x from 1 to 4. so let's plug in 4 first and then we could plug in one so the square root of four is two and the square root of one well that's one and two times two is four so we have 4 square root 5 and 2 times 1 is 2 and then we can subtract the coefficients so 4 minus 2 is 2. so the final answer is 2 square root 5 and that's it let's work on one final problem use the fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate this integral so what techniques should we employ because the 4 is a constant i'm going to move it to the front so this is equivalent to 1 4 and then we're integrating x plus the square root of x which is x to the one half the antiderivative of x is x squared over two and for x to the one half it's going to be x to the three over two divided by three over two or multiplied by two over three so now we can evaluate it so let's plug in one first so it's going to be one squared over two so that's one half and then one raised to the three halves is just one so that's gonna be plus two thirds and then if we plug in zero everything is going to be zero zero squared is zero and zero raised to the three over two is zero so we're left with one fourth times one-half plus two-thirds so we need to get common denominators so i'm going to multiply one-half by three over three and two thirds i'm going to multiply that by two over two so i'm going to have three over six and two times two is four three times two is six and then three plus four is seven so it's seven over six times one fourth seven times one is seven four times six is twenty four so the answer is seven over twenty four and that's it for this video you

water flows out of a storage tank at a rate defined by the function V Prime of t as shown above T is in minutes V Prime represents the volume flow rate of water in gallons per minute what is the rate at tal 12 minutes now to find a rate we could simply just plug it in we need to find V Prime of 12 so all we got to do is replace t with 12 so it's going to be 100 + 2.43 * 12us 05 * 12 2 so I'm going to do this one step at a time 2.43 * 12 is about 29.6 12 2 * 05 is 7.2 so if we add these values the rate at 12 minutes is going to be 121.9 6 lers per minute actually not liters but gallons per minute so that's all you have to do for part A now what about Part B how can we calculate the number of gallons of water that will flow out of the tank in the first 30 minutes how can we do that well there's something called the net change term the integration of frime of T which represents the rate of change of f with respect to time this is simply equal to F of B minus F of a so if we intergrate the volume flow rate or the rate of change of volume with respect to time if we integrate that function from 0 to 30 it's going to give us the number of gallons of water that's going to flow out of the tank in the first 30 minutes it's basically going to give us the net change of the gallons of water that's going to leave the sink so we need to integrate from 0 to 30 V Prime of T and this is going to be equal to V of 30 minus V of0 so V Prime of T is 100 plus 2.43 T minus 05 t^2 the anti-derivative of 100 is 100t and the anti-derivative of t to the first power is going to be t to the second power divid t by two excuse me and the anti-derivative of t^2 is T the 3 / 3 evaluated from 0 to 30 so let's plug in 30 first this is going to be 100 * 30 plus 2.43 / 2 that's about 1. 215 * 30 2 05 / 3 that's going to be 0.1 6 repeating time 30 to the 3 power and then minus now we need to plug in zero 100 * 0 is 0 0 2 * 2.43 that's zero so the whole thing is zero 100 time 30 is about 3,000 30 s * 1.25 that's a, 93.5 30 Cub times 016 repeating that's about 450 now let's add these three values so the final answer is 36435 now the unit that corresponds to this problem is gallons if V Prime of T is in gallons per minute V is going to be in gallons so that's how many gallons is going to flow into the tank or I mean out of the tank in the first 30 minutes here's another problem that we could try the daily electric power that is energy per unit time consumed by a typical household in a certain city let's say it can be modeled by this function P of where p is in power well p is the power in kilowatts and T is the time in hours and the time is restricted in a 24-hour period how much power in kilowatts is consumed at 11: a.m. if T is Zer at 12 a.m. or midnight now we already have the function that describes the power power is the rate of energy per unit of time power is defined as energy ID by time but we don't really need to use use this formula at this point we already have the function for power in kilowatt so all we need to do is plug in the appropriate T value if at midnight T is zero then at 11: a.m. T is equal to 11 so we got to find the value of P1 so it's going to be 13 +25 * 11 - 01 * 11^ 2 so now let's do the 25 * 11 is about 2.75 11 s is 121 * 01 that's 1.21 so by 11: a.m. this particular household is consuming up 14.54 Watts I mean kilowatts of power one kilowatt is about 1,000 watts and one watt represents one Jewel per second Jewels is the unit of energy but watts is the unit of power but now let's focus on Part B how much energy is consumed in a typical 24-hour period energy is power multiplied by time so let's say if you have a function for power energy is going to be the integration of P Prime of T DT now if you want to find a net change or how much energy is consumed you can use this formula it's p Prime of T DT evaluated from A to B and this is going to equal e of B minus E of a which will give us the amount of energy consumed and typical 24-hour period so let's go ahead and use that so A is z b is 24 and we're going to integrate this particular function the anti-derivative of 13 is 13t and the anti-derivative of 0.25t is25 t T ^2 / 2 and for the last one it's going to be 01 T 3r / 3 evaluated from 0 to 24 so let's begin by plugging in 24 now if we plug in zero the whole thing is going to be zero on the right side let's take this one step at a time so 13 * 24 is 312 24 2 is 576 * 25 / 2 so that's going to be positive 72 24 to the 3 power is 1382 4 * 01 and then divid by 3 that's going to be 46.8 so if we combine these three values the answer is 33792 now what are the units for this particular problem p is the power in kilowatts T is the time in hours so if you have a function where this is p and this is let's say this is in kilowatts and T is in hours the integration will basically give you the area under the curve to find the area you have to multiply the Y value by the x value so it's going to be kilowatt time hours or kilowatt hours so that's going to be the unit of the energy in this problem so this is the answer that's how much energy is consumed in this 24-hour period 

Transcript for: Finding Particular Solutions of Differential Equations Given Initial Conditions
let's say if we have the differential equation f prime of x is equal to 3x and also we're given the initial condition that f of 0 is equal to 7. with this information find a particular solution to this differential equation so how can we solve that differential equation well let's begin by finding the anti-derivative of both sides of that equation so the anti-derivative of f prime of x is equal to the anti-derivative of 3x so the integration of f prime of x is just going to be f of x and the anti-derivative of 3x is going to be 3x squared over 2 plus c now what we need to do is we need to solve for c anytime you want to find a particular solution of a certain differential equation so what we're going to do is plug in the initial condition f of 0 is 7. so 0 is the x value 7 correlates to the y value or the function value so we're going to replace the function with 7. so i'm going to write it like this first f of 0 is equal to 3 times 0 squared over 2 plus c now we know that f of 0 is 7. so i can replace this with seven so seven is equal to zero squared times three over two is zero so seven is equal to c so now i can rewrite the function replacing this with c so i could say that f of x is equal to 3 over 2 x squared plus c and this is the answer i'm looking for so that is the particular solution to this differential equation now let's go ahead and work on another example let's say that f prime of x is equal to six x squared minus five and we're given the initial condition that f of one is four go ahead and solve that differential equation so let's begin by finding the antiderivative of both sides of the function so on the left side it's just going to be f of x on the right side the anti-derivative of x squared using the power rule you need to add one to the exponent 2 plus 1 is 3 and then divide by that number and the anti-derivative of five is simply five x and don't forget the constant c so now let's replace x with one so f of one is going to be six divided by three which is two times one to the third minus five times one plus c now let's replace f of one with four because f of one is equal to four so we have four is equal to two minus five plus c two minus five is negative three and to solve for c we need to add 3 to both sides and 4 plus 3 is 7 so c is equal to 7. so now that we have the value of c we can write the final answer so this is the goal if you could solve for this then you can get the answer based on this expression you just need to replace c with 7. so f of x is going to be 6 divided by 2 which is this supposed to be a three by the way six divided by three which is two x cubed minus five x plus seven so this is the solution to the differential equation now instead of being given the first derivative sometimes we may receive the second derivative of the function let's say the second derivative is 2x minus 3. this time we need two initial conditions one for the first derivative and one for the original function so if you want to try it go ahead and determine a function for f of x solve this particular differential equation so let's begin by integrating both sides of that equation so the antiderivative of the second derivative f double prime is the first derivative f prime of x and on the right side the anti-derivative of x is going to be x squared divided by two and for negative three it becomes negative three x plus some constant c now we need to use this particular initial condition to solve for c so f prime of 1 that's going to be 2 over 2 which is 1 times x squared so that's 1 squared minus three times one plus c and f prime of one is equal to two one squared is one three times one is three and so this is what we have one minus three is negative two so i need to add two to both sides two plus two is four so c is equal to four so now we can write the general equation for f prime of x so f prime of x is going to be 2 divided by 2 is 1 so that's just x squared minus 3x and c is 4. so this is the first answer but we need to go all the way to f of x so now let's integrate both sides of that function so we have the anti-derivative of f prime of x and that's going to equal the anti-derivative of x squared minus 3x plus 4. so on the left this becomes f of x and on the right we have x cubed divided by three minus three x squared over two plus four x now instead of using c again we're gonna use a different constant of integration so let's choose the next letter d now f of zero is three so we have f of zero and zero to the third power is zero zero squared times three over two that's zero and then four times zero plus d now f of zero is three so d is equal to three so now we could write the final answer and that is that f of x is equal to one third x cubed minus three over two x squared plus four x and then replace d with three so this is the solution to the differential equation let's try another example so let's say that the second derivative is x squared minus four and f prime of two is three and f of one is negative four go ahead and solve the differential equation so let's start by integrating both sides so on the left the anti-derivative of the second derivative is going to be the first derivative on the right the anti-derivative of x squared is x cubed over three and for negative four becomes negative four x and plus c now we know that f prime of two is three so let's replace x with two so we have two to the third power minus three i mean divided by three minus four times two plus c now f prime of two is three and two to the third power is eight and four times two is eight so now let's add eight to both sides three plus eight is eleven and so we have eleven is equal to eight over three plus c now to get rid of the fraction i'm going to multiply everything by three and so 11 times 3 is 33 8 over 3 times 3 is just 8. and then c times 3 is three c so now let's subtract both sides by eight thirty three minus eight is twenty five and then we need to divide by three so we have c is twenty five over three so now we can write the final answer f prime of x is equal to one third x cubed minus four x plus 25 over 3. so if we plugged in 2 we should get 3. so now let's integrate this function so the integration of f prime is simply f and the antiderivative of x cubed is going to be x to the fourth divided by four and for x it's x squared over two and then for the constant 25 over three it's going to be 25 x over 3 plus a new constant d so now let's determine f of 1 so 1 to the fourth is just 1 and 3 times 4 is 12. and then 4 divided by 2 is 2 times 1 squared which is 1 and then it's going to be 25 over 3 plus some constant d now let's replace f of 1 with negative 4. so we have 1 over 12. minus 2 plus 25 over 3 plus d now to get rid of all the fractions i'm going to multiply everything by 12. i guess i don't need this information anymore so negative 4 times 12 that's negative 48. 12 divided by 12 is 1 2 times twelve is twenty-four twelve divided by three is four times twenty-five so that's gonna be a hundred and then plus twelve d now 100 minus 24 is 76 plus 1 that's going to be 77. so we have negative 48 is equal to 77 plus 12 d so negative 48 minus 77 that's negative 125 and then we need to divide both sides by 12. so d is negative 125 over 12. now we can write the final answer and that is that f of x is 1 over 12 x to the fourth minus two x squared plus twenty five x over three minus one twenty five over twelve and so this is the solution of the differential equation it was a little bit longer than the other problems but that's how you could find it so that's it for this video thanks for watching you 

Transcript for: Rectilinear Motion Problems - Distance, Displacement, Velocity, Speed & Acceleration
consider this problem a ball is thrown downward with an initial speed of 20 feet per second from an 800 foot cliff and we're given the acceleration due to gravity write a function for a of t that is the acceleration with respect to time now the acceleration due to gravity it's a fixed number and so a of t is simply equal to negative 32. it doesn't depend on time it's always the same now let's move on to part b what is the velocity of the ball at t equals zero well if we draw a picture let's say this is the building and here's the ball the ball is not released from rest it's thrown down with an initial speed of 20 feet per second so we could say that v0 is what v zero is negative twenty not positive twenty the speed of the ball is positive twenty but the velocity is negative twenty because velocity is dependent on direction the ball is going in a negative y direction so that's why it has to be negative so that's the answer for part b v of 0 is negative 20. now what about part c write a function for v of t what we need to do is we need to integrate this function so the anti-derivative of a of t dt that's going to equal the anti-derivative of negative 32 with respect to time now you need to know that the anti-derivative of the acceleration function will give you the velocity function and now we need to find the indefinite integral of negative 32 so that's going to be negative 32 t plus some constant c now we need to use the initial condition to find the value of c so let's replace t with zero v of zero is negative 20. negative 32 times zero is zero so we can see that c is negative 20. so the velocity function is going to be negative 32 t we have this part all we need to do is replace c with negative 20. so that's the velocity function we no longer need the acceleration function what is the speed of the ball at t equal four for part d well first we need to evaluate v of four so that's going to be negative 32 times 4 minus 20. now 30 times 4 is 120 because 3 times 4 is 12 and 2 times 4 is 8 so 32 times 4 is 128 minus 120 that's equal to negative 148. now what does this number represent it's negative 148 feet per second v of t gives you the velocity of the function remember the ball is going down so the velocity is negative but the speed is always positive speed is the absolute value of velocity so the speed at t equals 4 is going to be the absolute value of v of 4 and so that's going to be positive 148 feet per second so this is the answer for part d because we're looking for the speed and not the velocity now let's move on to part e what is the value of s of zero so what is the position of the ball at t equals zero now if you recall the ball was thrown downward from an 800 foot cliff so the initial position of the ball keep in mind s of t represents the position function is 800 feet the ball was 800 feet above ground level at the beginning of this problem so we could say that s of zero is 800 feet so now let's move on to part f calculate the distance traveled and the displacement of the ball in the first five seconds using vft the displacement is basically the difference between a position of one point and a position of another so the displacement is the final position minus the initial position which is basically s b minus s8 now it's important to understand that the position function is the antiderivative of the velocity function so if you want to write the position function you need to find the indefinite integral of v of t dt now if you want to find displacement you need to evaluate the definite integral of v of t dt from a to b so this will give you s of t evaluated from a to b which is the same as s of b minus s of a and that will give you the displacement of the ball now distance and displacement will be the same if the ball travels in one direction in this case it's not changing direction it's falling down straight so the distance and displacement will have the same magnitude however they will not have the same sign as the ball falls downward in the negative y direction displacement like velocity their vectors so they can be negative distance and speed will be positive so let's say the displacement was negative 200 meters the distance will be positive 200 meters the only time these two will vary in terms of magnitude is if the direction changes for example let's say if we travel five feet to the right and then eight feet to left the total distance traveled is five plus eight that's thirteen but the displacement is five plus negative eight which is negative three this is negative because it's going to the left this is positive because it's going to the right so the displacement will be negative three because the net change is negative three to the left if you go from the initial position to the final position you traveled a net of three feet to the left so that's the displacement but the total distance you actually traveled is five plus eight or 13. now let's go ahead and calculate the displacement so it's going to be the definite integral of the velocity function from a to b and so it's for the first five seconds that's from zero to five and the velocity function is negative 32 t minus 20. so that's going to be negative 32 t squared divided by 2 minus 20 t evaluated from 0 to 5. now negative 32 divided by 2 is negative 16. so s of 5 is going to be negative 16 times 5 squared minus 20 times 5. now typically there would be a constant c but we really don't have to worry about it if you're evaluating a definite integral so with the constant c that would become s of 5 but we're not going to worry about the constant since it's going to cancel and then minus now we need to plug in 0 so that's going to be negative 16 times 0 squared minus 20 times 0. now 5 squared is 25 and 25 times 16 that's 400 so we have negative four hundred and twenty times five is a hundred and then everything here is zero so negative four hundred minus one hundred is negative five hundred so this is the displacement the ball went down 500 feet in the first five seconds now the distance is positive 500 feet but the displacement is the negative 500 feet distance and displacement will have the same magnitude if the ball travels in one direction and if it doesn't change direction now let's move on to part g write a function for s of t the position function of the ball with respect to the ground in the y direction so what we need to do is find the antiderivative of v of t the antiderivative of v of t that is the velocity function will give us the position function so it's going to be negative 32 t squared over 2 which we know it's negative 16 t squared minus 20 t plus some constant c now we need to find the value of this constant and you can see it right here it's 800 if you replace t with zero this is going to be negative 16 times zero squared minus 20 times zero plus c s of zero is 800 and zero squared 20 times zero that's all zero so we can see that c is eight hundred so therefore the position function s of t is going to be negative 16 t squared minus 20 t plus 800 and so this is the answer for part g part h how long will it take for the ball to hit the ground well let's find out so the ball will hit the ground when the position function is equal to zero and we're asking how long so we're talking about time so we need to find the value of t when s is zero so let's replace s of t with zero and let's solve for t now first let's simplify this function so we can divide everything by negative 4. we're going to have to use the quadratic equation to calculate the value of t negative 16 divided by negative 4 is positive 4. negative 20 divided by negative 4 is positive 5 and 800 divided by negative 4 let's uh see what that's going to be so that's a negative 200 and so now let's use the quadratic formula so t is equal to negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac divided by 2a so in this example a is 4 b is 5 c is negative 200 we have the quadratic equation already in standard form so this is going to be negative 5 plus or minus b squared which is 5 squared so that's 25 minus 4 times a times c and 2 times a that's going to be 2 times 4 which is eight now 25 minus four times four times negative two hundred that's going to be positive three thousand two hundred and twenty-five so let's take the square root of that number so that becomes fifty-six 56.79 divided by eight now we have two possible answers plus or minus if we use the minus sign we're going to get a negative answer for t so we don't want that let's use the positive sign so t is going to be negative 5 plus 56.79 divided by 8. so you should get 6.47 seconds so that's how long it's going to take approximately for the ball to hit the ground so if you plug this in to s of t you should get approximately zero let's see negative 16 times 6.47 squared minus 20 times 6.47 plus 800. i got point eight two five six which is close to zero but keep in mind this is a routed answer it was really like six point four seven three something and this also is a rounded value so just keep that in mind if you use the exact answer this is going to equal zero now let's move on what is the speed of the ball just before it hits the ground now we know that speed is the absolute value of velocity and we have the time it takes just before it hits the ground now i'm going to use a more accurate answer which is going to be 6.4738 if you take that answer and plug it into this you should get a number like negative .037 which is very close to zero so let's plug it into this expression so we have the absolute value of negative 32 times 6.4738 minus 20. and so that's going to be negative 227.2 and the final answer is going to be positive 227.2 and that's around the answer and that's feet per second so that's how fast the ball is moving just before it hits the ground and so that's it for this video hopefully it gave you a good understanding of calculus along with some physics problems like position function and velocity functions and acceleration functions you 

Transcript for: How To Integrate Using U-Substitution
in this video i'm going to show you how to integrate using u-substitution so we're going to focus on the definite integrals how can we find the anti-derivative of 4x times x squared plus five raised to the third power so what do we need to do we need to define two things we need to identify the u variable and d u now whatever you select u to be du has to be the derivative if we select u to be 4x the derivative will be 4 and that's not going to get rid of x squared plus 5. we need to change all of the x variables into u variables now if we make u equal to x squared plus 5 d u is going to be 2x which can cancel the x and 4x and that's what we want to do so let's set u equal to x squared plus five d u is going to be 2x but times dx so what i'm going to do now is solve for dx in this equation so if i divide both sides by 2x dx is equal to du divided by 2x now what you need to do is replace this with u and replace the dx with du over 2x and it will all work out so let's go ahead and do that so we have 4x and then u raised to the third power and then u divided by two x so here we can cancel x four x divided by two x is two so it's two times the antiderivative of u to the third using the power rule is going to be two times u to the fourth over four plus c now two over four is one half so it's one half u to the fourth plus c the last thing you need to do is replace u with what it equals and that's x squared plus five so this is the answer let's try another problem go ahead and find the integration of 8 cosine 4x dx so what should we make u equal to we need to make u equal to 4x d u will equal 4 dx and if we divide by 4 du over 4 is dx so let's replace 4x with u and let's replace dx with du divided by 4. so this is going to be 8 cosine of the u variable and replace dx with du over four so now we could divide eight by four eight divided by four is two now what is the anti-derivative of cosine the anti-derivative of cosine is sine because the derivative of sine is cosine so we have 2 sine u plus the constant of integration c now let's replace u with 4x so the final answer is 2 sine 4x plus c so hopefully you see a pattern emerging when integrating by u substitution the key is to identify what u and d u is going to be once you figure that out you just got to follow the process and it's not going to be that bad so let's work on a few more examples so you can master this technique let's try x cube e raised to the x to the fourth so what should we make u equal to x cube or x to the fourth if u is x to the third d u will be three x squared and that will not completely get rid of x to the fourth but if we make u equal to x to the fourth d u will be equal to four x cubed and that can get rid of the x cubed that we see here so let's do that let's make u equal to x to the fourth so d u is going to be 4x cubed dx and then as always solve for dx if you don't do that you can easily make a mistake so i recommend in a step isolate dx it'll save you a lot of trouble later on so du is going to be i mean dx is going to be du over 4x cubed now let's replace x to the fourth with u and let's replace dx with d u over four x cubed so this is going to be e raised to the u times d u over four x cubed so x cubed will cancel which is good and the 4 we can move it to the front now because it's in the bottom of the fraction it's 1 over 4. now the antiderivative of e to the u is simply e to the u so the final answer well not the final answer but the antiderivative is one fourth e to the u plus c and now let's replace u with x to the fourth so this is the final answer one fourth e raised to the x to the fourth plus c and that's it here's another one find the indefinite integral of 8x times the square root of 40 minus 2x squared dx so typically you want to make u equal to the stuff that's more complicated and that is the stuff on the inside of the square root if we make u equal to 40 minus 2x squared d u is going to be the derivative of 40 is zero so we can ignore that and the derivative of negative 2x squared that's going to be negative 4x dx so isolating dx we need to divide both sides by negative 4x so it's du over negative 4x so let's replace this with u and this part dx with du over negative 4x so it's going to be 8x times the square root of u times du divided by negative four x eight x divided by negative four x is negative two and i'm going to write that in front the square root of u is the same as u to the one half so now we can use the power rule one half plus one is three over two and then we could divide by three over two or multiply by two over three which is the better option so negative two times two thirds that's negative four over three now the last thing we need to do is replace the u variable with 40 minus two x squared so the final answer is negative four over three 40 minus 2x squared raised to the 3 over 2 plus c and that's all we need to do let's work on some more problems feel free to pause the video and try this one integrate x cubed divided by two plus x to the fourth raised to the second power now typically it's better to make u equal to the stuff that has the higher exponent four is higher than three so let's make u equal to two plus x to the fourth d u is going to be the derivative of x to the fourth so that's 4x to the third power times dx and as always i recommend that you solve for dx just to avoid mistakes so let's replace two plus x to the fourth with u and let's replace dx with this thing that we have here so we have x to the third on top u squared on the bottom and dx is d u over 4 x cubed and if you do it this way as you can see the remaining x variables will cancel out nicely so this 4 is in the bottom let's move it to the front so it becomes 1 4 anti-derivative 1 over u squared d u and so let's move the u squared from the bottom to the top so this is going to be 1 4 integration of u to the negative two d u and now we can use the power rule so if we add one to negative two that's going to be negative one and then we need to divide by negative one so now let's bring this variable back to the bottom to make the negative exponent positive so it's negative one over four u plus c now let's replace u with what we set it equal to in the beginning so i'm going to need a bigger fraction so u is 2 plus x to the fourth and then plus c so this is the final answer let's integrate sine to the fourth of x times cosine of x dx so go ahead and find the anti-derivative of this trigonometric function so if we make u equal to cosine d u will be negative sine dx that will only cancel one of the sine variables and it's best to make u equal to the trig function that you have more of we have four sines and only one cosine so it's best to make u equal to sine x and d u will be equal to cosine x and since there's only one cosine this will be completely cancelled solving for dx is going to be du divided by cosine x and don't forget that last step always isolate dx so let's replace this with you so this is going to be u to the fourth times cosine x and dx is du divided by cosine so we could cancel cosine x and so we're left with the indefinite integral of u to the fourth d u using the power rule four plus one is five and then divide by five so we have one-fifth u to the five plus c and the last thing we need to do is replace u with sine x so it's one-fifth sine raised to the fifth power of x plus c and that concludes this problem now what would you do if you have to integrate the square root of 5x plus 4. now in this problem all we could do is set u equal to 5x plus 4. there's nothing else that we can do so let's go ahead and do this the derivative of 5x is going to be 5 and then times dx so isolating dx it's going to be du over 5. so just like before we're going to replace 5x plus 4 with u and d x with d u over five so then this becomes the square root of u and dx is d u divided by five and move the five to the front so this is one fifth and then instead of the square root of u we're gonna write it as u to the one-half so now let's use the power rule one-half plus one that's gonna be three over two and if you divide it by three over two what i would recommend is multiply the top and the bottom by two thirds so the threes in the bottom will cancel and the twos will cancel as well so in the end you get one-fifth u to the three-halves times two over three which becomes two over fifteen u to the three-half and let's not forget the constant of integration plus c so now to write the final answer all we need to do is replace u with five x plus four so it's two over fifteen five x plus four raised to the three over two plus c and so that's the solution so as you can see u-substitution is not very difficult once you get the hang of it as long as you do a few problems and get used to the method and the techniques employed here it's a piece of cake now this problem is a little bit different from the others go ahead and try it i recommend that you pause the video and give this one a go so let's set u equal to the stuff that's more complicated three x plus two now d u that's gonna be the derivative of 3x which is 3 times dx so isolating dx it's going to be du over 3 and this time this x variable will not cancel so notice that the x variables are of the same degree and when you see this situation it indicates that in this expression you need to solve for x so isolating x i need to move the two to the other side so i have u minus two is equal to three x and then dividing by three u minus two over three is x which you can write it as you can say x is 1 3 u minus 2 which i think looks a lot better now keep in mind in order to perform u substitution we need to eliminate every x variable in this expression if we replace three x plus two with u and then dx with d u over three this x will still be here and so that's why we need to solve for x in this expression so make sure to do that if these two are of the same degree so this is going to be one third i'm gonna have to rewrite it because i can't fit it in here so let's replace x first with one third u minus two and then we have the square root of u and dx is d u divided by three so 1 3 times du over 3 that's going to be du over 9. so i'm going to take the 1 9 and move it to the front and then i have u minus 2 and the square root of u is u to the one half and then d u so now we only have the u variable in this form we can integrate it now the next thing we need to do is distribute u to the one half to u minus two so u to the first power times u to the one half we need to add one and one half that's going to be u to the three over two and then if we multiply negative two by u to the one half that's negative two u to the one half and then times d u so now we can find the antiderivative of each one so for u to the three halves is going to be three over two plus one which is five over two and instead of dividing it by five over two we're gonna multiply by two over five and for u to the one-half one-half plus one is three over two and then we're going to multiply by two thirds and then we need to add plus c so now let's distribute one over nine to everything on the inside so 1 over 9 times 2 over 5 that's going to be 2 over 45 times u raised to the 5 over 2. and then we have one knife times this is basically negative four-thirds so that's gonna be negative four over twenty-seven and that's u to the three over two and then plus c so now let's replace u with three x plus two so the final answer is going to be two over forty five three x plus two raised to the five over two minus four over twenty seven times three x plus two raised to the three over two plus c and that is it now let's work on this example it's very similar to the last one so you can try if you want more practice so let's set u equal to 4x minus 5 which means du is going to be the derivative of 4x that's 4 and then times dx so solving for dx it's du divided by 4. now we need to isolate x in this expression so if we add 5 u plus five is equal to four x and then if we divide by four x is equal to this which we can write it as one fourth u plus five so let's replace x with this expression and then 4x minus 5 with u and then dx with du over 4. so what we have is two times one fourth u plus five and then the square root of u or u to the one half and then dx is d u over four so two times one fourth is one half and one half times one over four is one eighth so we can move the one eighth to the front and then we have u to the half times u plus five now let's distribute u to the one half so u to the one half times u to the first power one half plus one that's going to be three over two and then plus 5 u to the one half so now we need to integrate the expression that we now have so this is going to be one over eight u three over two plus one that's five over two and then times two over five and then one half plus one is three over two times two over three and then plus c one over eight times two over five that's going to be two over forty and then times u raised to the five over two and then we have five times two over three that's ten over three times one over eight so that's going to be ten over eight times three is twenty four and this is going to be u to the 3 over 2 plus c now 2 over 40 can be reduced to 1 over 20. and let's replace u with 4x minus 5. so this is going to be 4x minus 5 raised to the 5 over 2. and then 10 over 24 you could reduce that to 5 over 12 and then it's going to be 4x minus 5 to the 3 halves and then plus c you 

Transcript for: Integrating Exponential Functions By Substitution - Antiderivatives - Calculus
in this video we're going to focus on integrating exponential functions so let's go ahead and begin what is the antiderivative of e to X DX what do you think the answer is for this function it's simply going to equal the same thing it's e to X plus C now what about this one what is the anti-derivative of e to 2x DX this is going to be e to 2x / the derivative of 2x which is 2 plus C that technique Works only if you divide it by a constant if you divide it by a variable it's not going to work so what do you think the answer for this one is e to NE 5x DX it turns out that it's going to be the same thing e to 5x / the derivative of 5x which is5 plus C now let's prove the last one using uh U substitution so let's make U equal to 5x du is the derivative of 5x which is5 time DX and solving for DX it's du /5x so now let's replace -5x with the U variable and let's replace DX with du over5 now let's take the constant neg5 and let's uh move it to the front so it's ne5 anti-derivative of EU or e to the U du now we know that the integration of e to the x is simply e to X so the anti-derivative of e to U is simply e to U plus C and now we can replace youu with 5x so the final answer oh by the way this should be uh negative one over5 because the five is on the bottom so just keep that in mind almost forgot about that but the final answer is -1 over5 e to 5x + C which is the same thing as what we have which was e to 5x /5 + C here's another one X Cub * e to x 4 DX go ahead and integrate the function so we can integrate by substitution let's replace U with x 4 so therefore du is going to be the derivative of x 4 which is 4xb * DX and now let's solve for DX that's du over 4xb so let's replace x to the 4th with the U variable and now let's replace DX with du over 4X cub and so we could cancel X Cub now let's move the four to the front so it's 1/4 anti-derivative e to U du the integration of e to the U is just e to U * 1/4 + C and now all we need to do is replace U with x 4 so the final answer is 1/4 e raised to the x 4 plus C and as you can see it's not that bad so that's it for that problem and now let's move on to the next one here's another one you could try e to X time theun of 1 - e to X DX so what do you think we need to do first in this example we should make U equal to 1us e to X if we do that du is going to be netive e to X DX the derivative of one is zero the derivative of e to X is e to X so the derivative of negative e to X is e tox now Sol for DX it's du over e tox so this is going to be e to x times the square < TK of U and DX is Du / e to X so we can cancel e to X so we can move the negative in front the square root of U is basically u^ 12 and then time du so now let's integrate let's add one to the exponent 12 + 1 is 3 2 and instead of dividing it by 3 over2 we can multiply it by 2 over 3 let's add the constant C so now we need to replace you with 1 - e to X so the final answer is -2 over3 1 - e to X raised to the 3 over 2 + C and that's it for this problem here's the next one e to x + e tox / e to x - e x DX so let's integrate this what should we make U equal 2 the bottom one or the top one in this problem we want to make U equal to the bottom one so it can we can get rid of the top one so U is going to be e to x minus E tox so now let's find du the derivative of e to the x is just e to the X the derivative of negative e to thex is going to be negative e tox * 1 and all of this is multiplied by uh DX so e x * 1 is basically POS e so solving for DX it's du over e to the X Plus e to thex and this is good because we can see that this is the same as a numerator which means that it's going to cancel soon so let's rewrite what we have let's replace the denominator with the U variable because they're equal to each other and let's replace DX with du over e x + e tox and so these two will cancel and now what we have is the anti-derivative of 1 U du which is going to be Ln U plus C and now we can replace U with this so the answer is the natural log of ECX minus E tox plus C and let's put this in absolute value and so this is the solution let's work on another one e to 1x^2 / X Cub DX so what do you think we should make U equal to in this example let's make U equal to 1/x^2 and before we find a derivative let's rewrite it this is equal to X raus 2 so du using the power rule is going to be -2 x to -2 -1 or -3 time DX now before we solve for DX Let's uh simplify let's get rid of the negative exponent we could do that by moving X from the top to the bottom SO3 will now become posi3 and now let's get DX by itself so first let's multiply both sides by X Cub so these will cancel and so we have X Cub du is equal to -2 DX so now let's divide both sides by -2 to get DX by itself so DX is equal to X Cub du / by -2 so now let's replace 1 /x^2 with u so this is a e raised to the U / XB and let's replace DX with what we have here and that's X Cub du over -2 and so let's cancel X cub and let's take the -2 move it to the front so it's going to come out as-2 integration e to u d which is equal to2 e to U + C and now all we need to do is replace U with what it was so the answer is going to be -2 e to the 1 /x^2 plus C and that's it for this one now what about this problem what is the anti-derivative of e to 3x + 4 e to x + 5 / e to X DX what do you think we should do here so we have a fraction and there's only one term in a denominator what we can do is split the fraction into three smaller fractions so it's e to 3x over e to x + 4 e to X over e to x + 5 over e to X now what's E to 3x ID e to X well we go back to algebra x 7 / x^2 is x 5 you need to subtract the exponents 7 - 2 so here we got to subtract the exponents 3x - x or 3x - 1 1 x is 2x so right now we have e to 2x now 4 e to X over e to the X these cancel because they're the same x - x is Zer so you just get four e to the Z is one by the way now this e to X we can move to the top and it become e to the negative X or 5 e to X and now we can integrate it in this form the anti-derivative of e 2x is simply e 2X 2 integration of 4 is just 4X and for the next one it's going to be 5 e tox divid the derivative ofx which is1 plus C and so that's the solution 

Transcript for: U-substitution With Definite Integrals
in this video we're going to focus on evaluating definite integrals using u substitution so let's start with this example let's say if we want to find the value of the definite integral of 2x x squared plus four raised to the second power from zero to two so first we need to integrate the function using u substitution so we're going to make u equal to x squared plus 4 so that d u is 2x which can get rid of the 2x in the front now du is going to be 2x times dx and we need to divide both sides by 2x to isolate dx so let's replace u or x squared plus 4 with u and let's replace the dx with du over two x so this is going to be u to the second power and d u over two x now as soon as you get rid of all of the x variables and replace with you variables you need to adjust the lower limits and the upper limits using this expression so what is u when x is zero so let's plug in zero zero squared plus four is four so the lower limit is four now the upper limit as an x value is two what is it as a u value so two squared plus four that's four plus four so this is going to be eight so now we can evaluate u squared from 4 to 8. the antiderivative of u squared is going to be u to the third over three evaluated from four to eight so if we plug in eight it's gonna be eight to the third over three and then minus four to the third over three when we plug in four so now what is eight cubed so that's eight times eight times eight which is five hundred and twelve four to the third power is sixty-four and five-twelve minus sixty-four is 448 which is not divisible by 3. so this is the final answer 448 over 3 and so that's how you can evaluate definite integrals using u substitution as soon as you change the variables from x to u make sure to change the value of the lower limit and the upper limit from x-values to their corresponding u-values here's another problem that you could try go ahead and evaluate this particular definite integral using u substitution so we're going to set u equal to this expression because x squared is higher than x now if u is equal to 16 minus x squared what is d u the derivative of sixteen is zero and the derivative of negative x squared is negative two x and now let's solve for dx so let's divide by negative two x so dx is equal to du divided by negative 2x and now at this point let's replace 16 minus x squared with the u variable and let's replace dx with du over negative 2x so this is going to be 4x times the square root of u and then d u divided by negative two x so four x divided by negative two x that's going to be negative two and now we need to change these values so let's plug it into this expression so when x is 0 what is the value of u that's 16 minus 0 squared and so this is going to be 16. now when x is 4 what is u 16 minus 4 squared that's 16 minus 16 that's gonna be zero and the square root of u is u to the one half so now we don't need this anymore right now now what is the antiderivative of u raised to the one half so one half plus one that's three over two and instead of dividing by three over two we're going to multiply by the reciprocal two over three and we still have a negative two in front and let's evaluate this from 16 to zero so negative two times two thirds that's negative four thirds so if we plug in zero it's going to be negative four over three times zero to the three halves and then minus negative four over three times sixteen raised to the three over two so zero raised to anything is just zero and here we have two negative signs so that's going to become positive so we have positive four over three times sixteen raised to the three over two now what is sixteen raised to the one point five or three over two how can we evaluate this rational exponent this is the same as 16 raised to the one half raised to the three when you raise one exponent to another you need to multiply it sixteen to the one half is the same as the square root of sixteen which we know to be four and four to the third is sixty-four so we now have four over three times sixty-four and four times sixty-four four times sixty is two forty because four times six is twenty-four four times 4 is 16 so 240 plus 16 is 256 and therefore this is the final answer for this example it's 256 divided by 3. let's work on one more example evaluate the definite integral from one to two of two x one plus x squared raised to the third power dx now we need to make u equal to 1 plus x squared because d u the derivative of 1 plus x squared is going to be 2x times dx and so we could cancel the 2x on top so now let's solve for dx let's divide both sides by 2x so dx is equal to du over 2x now let's replace one plus x squared with u and let's replace dx with du over 2x so this is going to be 2x divided by u to the third and dx is du over 2x and so we could cancel 2x and don't forget we need to change the limits of integration so what is u when x is one it's going to be one plus one squared which is two now what is the value of u when x is two so it's one plus two squared or one plus four which is five so we need to integrate one over u to the third from two to five so first let's rewrite this expression let's bring the u variable to the top so it's going to be u to the negative three and now the anti-derivative of u to the negative 3 that's going to be negative 3 plus 1 that's negative 2 divided by negative 2 evaluated from 2 to 5. now let's rewrite it so this is negative 1 divided by 2 u squared from two to five and now let's plug in the upper limit so it's negative one over two times five squared and then minus negative 1 over 2 times the lower limit 2 squared 5 squared is 25 and these two negative signs will change into a positive sign 2 squared is 4. now 2 times 25 that's 50. and 2 times 4 is 8 but i'm going to rewrite it as 1 over 8 minus 1 over 50. so we need to get common denominators what number goes into what number is divisible by eight and fifty the only thing i can think of is two hundred eight doesn't go into a hundred but eight goes into two hundred because a goes into forty and forty goes into two hundred so to get 50 to 200 we need to multiply the top and bottom by four two hundred divided by eight is twenty-five so the first fraction we need to multiply the top and bottom by twenty-five so this is gonna be twenty-five over two hundred minus four over two hundred and twenty five minus four is twenty one so the final answer is twenty one divided by two hundred you 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 - Integration & Antiderivatives
now in this video we're going to go over integration how to find the antiderivative of certain functions and now if you recall according to the power rule the derivative of x raised to the nth power that is a variable raised to a constant is equal to n X raised to the N minus 1 now the power rule when dealing with antiderivatives or integration is like this instead of subtracting the exponent by 1 you need to add 1 to the exponent and instead of multiplying you're going to divide the result of what you see here and plus you need to add the constant of integration and so that's basically the power rule for integration let's work on some examples so let's say if we wish to find the derivative of X cube using the power rule we can see that our n value is stream so it's 3 X raised to the 3 minus 1 which is 2 so the derivative of X cube is 3x squared now let's say if we wish to find the antiderivative of 3 x squared well we need to do in this case is add 1 to the exponent and then divide by that new exponent 2 plus 1 is 3 and 3 divided by 3 is 1 and so this gives us our original answer which is X cube but we need to add the constant of integration if we were to take the derivative of x cubed plus the constant of integration it will give us three x squared plus zero the derivative of any constant is zero and so we don't know what this constant could be it could be five it could be negative eight it could be zero but when dealing with an indefinite integral you always need to add the constant of integration now let's find the antiderivative of X to the fourth go ahead and work on this example so using the power rule we need to add 1 to 4 and divide by that result and let's add C so 4 plus 1 is 5 so it's going to be X to the fifth power divided by 5 plus C but you can also write your answer like this you could say it's 1/5 X to the fifth plus C go ahead and try these two examples find the antiderivative of x squared and X to the seventh so feel free to take a minute and try those two so this one is going to be X at a third over 3 plus say you just add 1 to 2 and then 7 plus 1 is 8 so this is going to be X to the 8 over 8 plus C and so that's a simple way in which you could find the antiderivative of a monomial now what is the antiderivative of X what's the answer so this is X to the first power so it's going to be x squared divided by 2 and that's it for that one now what about this what if we have a fraction what is the indefinite integral of x over 4 DX in this case what you could do is rewrite it let's move the 4 to the front and so this is the same as 1/4 antiderivative of ax DX and then use the power rule so that's gonna be one-fourth times x squared over two plus C so four times two is eight the final answer is going to be one over eight x squared plus C now what about this one let's say if this is 8 X to the 3rd power what's the answer for this one well let's move the 8 to the front and then let's find the antiderivative of X cube so 3 plus 1 is 4 and then let's divide by that result and now we could simplify it so 8 divided by 4 that's going to be 2 and the answer is going to be 2 X to the fourth power plus C now what about a constant what is the antiderivative of four all you need to do in a situation like this is add a variable to it so since we have a DX we're going to add the variable X let's say if we have the integration of five dy the answer will be 5y plus C now let's go back to the first example to show you a work using the power rule his we could do 4 is the same as 4 times X to the 0 power because anything raised to the 0 power is 1 so if we add 1 to 0 and then divide by 1 this will give us the same result for X and so that's what you could do when dealing with a constant so the antiderivative of negative 7 let's say DZ this would be negative 7 times Z plus C so based on what you see here you need to introduce that variable and your answer now let's find the antiderivative of a binomial let's say 7x minus 6 go ahead and try that so what we need to do is integrate each component of this expression separately so the antiderivative of 7x is going to be 7 X to the 2nd power over 2 and for a constant we simply need to add an X variable to it and then let's add the constant of integration and so this is the answer there's another one find the antiderivative of 6x squared plus 4x minus 7 go ahead and find the antiderivative of that particular trinomial so let's add 1/2 to 2 plus 1 is 3 / the exponent and then let's add one to this exponent so one plus one is two and then divide by two and the antiderivative of negative seven is negative 7x and now let's simplify so 6 divided by 3 is 2 and then 4 divided by 2 that's 2 and so this is going to be the answer for this problem so as you can see it's not really too difficult finding the antiderivative of a function as you work out a few problems it gets easier but now let's move on to the radical functions what is the antiderivative of the square root of x go ahead and try that now the first thing you need to do is you need to rewrite the expression this is X to the first power and the index number is a two if it's not present so this is the same as X to the 1/2 as a rational exponent and now let's use the power rule so let's add one to the exponent and then divide by that result so 1/2 plus 1 is the same as 1/2 plus 2 divided by 2 because 2 divided by 2 is still 1 and 1 plus 2 is 3 so 1/2 plus 1 is 3 over 2 so now we have X raised to the 3 over 2 / derivative now what I'm going to do is multiply the top and bottom by 2/3 and so here the twos will cancel and a 3 so will cancel so 1/3 1/2 or 1/3 over 2 is the same as 2 over 3 all you need to do is flip the fraction so the final answer for this problem is 2 over 3x raised to the river 2 plus C now you can leave your answer like this if you want to or you can convert it back into its radical form and so X to the three halves is the same as the square root of x cube now you really don't need to write the two you can put it there if you want to but it's the same so you can also leave your answer like this if you prefer let's work on another example find the antiderivative of the cube root of x to the fourth go ahead and try that so step one is that we need to rewrite it this is X raised to the 4 over 3 the index number goes on the bottom and the exponent goes on the numerator of the fraction whenever you want to convert it from its radical form into a rational exponent so now let's integrate the expression so this is going to be X raised to the 4 over 3 plus 1/4 over 3 plus 1 now we need to get common denominators so I'm going to replace 1 with 3 divided by 3 and so now we can add the numerators of those two fractions so 4 plus 3 is 7 and so what we have right now let's not forget plus C this is going to be X raised to the 7 over 3 divided by 7 over 3 plus C now X divided by 7 over 3 is the same as X times 3 over 7 if you wish to show your work what you could do is multiply like we did before by the reciprocal of 7 over 3 and so these will cancel and the 7s will cancel and so the final answer is 3 over 7 X raised to the 7 over 3 plus C or we can write it like this 3 over 7 times the cube root of x to the 7 plus C and that's it now for practice let's try another one let's try the fourth root of x to the seventh power to take a minute and work on that example so just like before we're going to rewrite it so this is X raised to the 7 over 4 and now let's add 1 so this is going to be 7 over 4 plus 1 divided by 7 over 4 plus 1 now 7 over 4 plus 1 we can replace the one with 4 over 4 so 7 plus 4 is 11 so we get X to the 11th over 4 / 11 over 4 plus C and so instead of dividing it by 11 over 4 we can multiply the X variable by the reciprocal which is 4 of 11 so it's 4 over 11 X to the 11th over 4 plus C and then we can rewrite it as 4 of 11 times the fourth root of x to the 11 plus C and that's all you need to do for that example now let's talk about the integration of certain trigonometric expressions and so if you have a notepad you may want to write down some notes now recall that the derivative of sine X is cosine X so therefore the antiderivative of cosine X DX has to be sine X plus C now the derivative of cosine X we know it's negative sine X plus C so the antiderivative of negative sine X DX has to be positive cosine X plus C which means that the antiderivative of positive sine X DX must be negative cosine X if we reverse the sign and there's no point reverse in and the sign for the constant because Z could be 5 or negative 5 it doesn't matter now let's move on to the derivative of tangent X which is secant squared so the antiderivative of secant squared it's tangent X plus C and so these are formulas that you just have to know if you don't know him make sure you write them down and as you do your homework you're going to become familiar with those expressions now the next one we know that the derivative of cotangent is negative cosecant squared so the antiderivative of negative cosecant squared is cotangent and the antiderivative of positive cosecant squared is going to be negative cotangent X next up we have the derivative of secant X and so that's going to be secant X tangent X so the antiderivative of secant tangent as you know by now has to be well let's not forget DX so this has to be secant X plus C and the last one the derivative of cosecant X is negative cosecant x cotangent X so the antiderivative of positive cosecant X cotangent X changing the sign has to be negative cosecant X plus C and so make sure you know those common trigonometric expressions along with their derivatives and integrals so let's say if we wish to find the antiderivative of 4 sine X minus 5 cosine X plus 3 secant squared X now the antiderivative of sine is negative cosine and the antiderivative of cosine is positive sine and the antiderivative of secant squared is tangent and so the answer is going to be negative for cosine X minus 5 sine X plus 3 tangent X plus C and that's it so as you can see it's important to know the integrals of common trig expressions so you can do questions like these now let's talk about the difference between an indefinite integral and a definite integral an indefinite integral it looks like the expression on the left on the right I'm going to draw a definite integral a definite integral has the lower limit of integration and the upper limit of integration and so it has those values the indefinite integral will give you a answer in terms of X so you get an algebraic expression where as a definite integral it will give you a number your final answer should be a specific number like 25 36 or something so let's go through both examples so to find the indefinite integral of 6x squared we need to use the power rule and so the answer is going to be 2x cubed plus C so anytime you you're dealing with an indefinite integral you're going to get an expression in terms of some variable plus the constant of integration now when dealing with a definite integral you don't need to worry about the constant of integration it's going to disappear now we still need to use the power rule on this expression so that's not going to change so we're going to get 2x cubed now we need to evaluate it from 1 to 2 so the first thing you need to do is replace X with 2 and then you need to subtract it by replacing X with 1 2 to the third power is 8 and 1 to the third power is just 1 so it's going to be 16 minus 2 which is 14 and so that's how you can evaluate a definite integral using the limits of integration now let's say if we incorporated the constancy at this point so once we integrated this expression and got to X cube what's going to happen if we introduce the constant of integration so when you plug in 2 you're going to get 2 times 2 to the third power plus C and then minus 2 times 1 to the third plus C so notice that C cancels C minus C will disappear and so your answer will still be 14 and thus when dealing with definite integrals it's not necessary to add the constant of integration you could just ignore it go ahead and try this one let's say if we have 8x minus 3a DX and we wish to evaluate it from let's say 2 2 3 go ahead and find a value of that definite integral so first let's integrate the expression this is going to be 8x squared over 2 minus 3x from 2 to 3 and then 8 divided by 2 is 4 so we can write that as 4x squared now the first thing we're going to do is plug in the top number 3 so let's replace X with 3 and now let's replace X with 2 3 squared is 9 9 times 4 is 36 3 times 3 is 9 2 squared is 4 times 4 that's 16 3 times 2 is 6 36 minus 9 is 27 16 minus 6 is 10 and 27 minus 10 is 17 and so this is the answer now I'm going to take a minute to let you know that for those of you who want to support my patreon page I'm going to post the second part of this video so the video that you're currently watching is just the first half of the video but if you want to have access to the second part of the video feel free to check it out on my patreon page and you can also access other video content that I have there as well that you might find interesting so feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance and let's get back to the lesson now just to give you some background info the process by which we evaluate the definite integral comes from the fundamental theorem of calculus one part of it says the integral from A to B of some function f of X DX where this function is continuous on a closed interval from A to B is equal to the evaluation of the antiderivative which is capital F at B the minus the evaluation of the antiderivative F at a and so basically that's what we did we've integrated f of X to give us the antiderivative capital F and then we plugged in the top number first and then the bottom number later and so the way we evaluate the definite integral it comes from the fundamental theorem of calculus now it's important to know that the integral of f of X DX that is the indefinite integral is equal to the antiderivative which is represented by capital F Plus see so it makes you understand this capital F is the antiderivative of lowercase F and if you were to take the derivative of capital F it will give you a lowercase F so the derivative of capital f of X is equal to lowercase F of X now let's talk about exponential functions the derivative of an exponential function like e to the U is e to the U times u prime now what about the antiderivative of e to the U now if u is a linear function let's say ax plus B you could use this formula it's e to u divided by u prime if it's a quadratic function a cubic function is not going to work so let me give you some examples let's say if we wish to find the antiderivative of e 3x it's going to be e 3x divided by the derivative of X which is 1 plus C and so it's e to the X now let's say if we want to find the antiderivative of e to the 5x it's going to be well let's write the formula if you wish to follow it so remember it only works if you as a linear function so you as 5x that means you prime is 5 so it's easy to you that's e to the 5x divided by 5 plus C and so that's it so let's say if we wish to find the integral of e to the negative 7x and also let's say e to the 3x minus 5 for the first one it's going to be e to the negative 7x divided by the derivative of negative 7x which is negative 7 plus C and for the next one it's going to be e to the 3x minus 5 / the derivative of 3x minus 5 which is 3 and so that's a quick and simple way in which you can basically find the antiderivative of exponential functions if this is a linear function now let's work on a similar problem but using a different technique to get the answer so for this one we know the antiderivative of e to the 8x it's e to the 8x over 8 plus C but let's use another method to get that answer and the method that we're going to use is something called u substitution we're going to make the u variable equal to 8x now we're going to find the differential of U which is D U and the derivative of 8x is 8 times the differential of X or DX so D U is 8 DX next we're going to solve for DX by dividing both sides by 8 so D u over 8 is equal to DX now let's replace a tax with the u variable and let's replace DX with D u divided by 8 now it's important to understand that the antiderivative of e to the X is e to the X plus C and this is something that you need to commit to memory so make sure you know that expression so right now we have e to you and then DX is d u over 8 and we're gonna move the 8 to the front so it's 1 over 8 integral of e to you bu and the antiderivative of each of you is just easy to you just as the antiderivative of e to the X is e to the X so this is 1 over 8 e 2 u plus C now we need to replace the U variable with 8x so the final answer is 1 over 8 e to the 8x plus C and so that's how you could show you work using the technique known as use substitution now let's try another example what is the aunt derivative of 4x e raised to the x squared DX now for this we need to use u substitution again but this time we're going to make u equal to x squared D u that's going to be the derivative of x squared which is 2x times DX and now let's get DX by itself let's divide both sides by 2x and so this disappears so DX is d u divided by 2x just like we did before let's replace x squared with the u variable unless replace DX with D u over 2 X so this is going to be integral 4x e 3u times D u over 2x now we can cancel these two 4x divided by 2x is 2 and let's move the 2 to the front so it's 2 integral e to the UD u which is equal to 2 e to the U plus C now the last thing we need to do is replace U with x squared so the final answer is going to be 2 e to the x squared plus C and so u substitution is a common technique that you need to be familiar with we're dealing with integration now let's talk about how to find the antiderivative of rational functions so what is the antiderivative of 1 over x squared how can we find the answer here now what we need to do is we need to rewrite the expression and the way we can do this is by moving the X variable to the top and as you do that the sign of the exponent changes from positive 2 to negative 2 and so at this point we could use the power rule so what we can do is add 1 to the exponent and then divide by that result and let's not forget to add the constant of integration so negative one I mean negative two plus one is negative one and at this point after you integrate it you can move the X variable back to the bottom where the exponent will change from negative one to positive one and so our answer is negative one over X or X to the first power and so this is the antiderivative of 1 over x squared it's negative 1 over X now let's try another example let's find the antiderivative of 1 over X cubed so go ahead and work on that problem so feel free to take a minute and try step one is to rewrite the problem by moving the X variable to the top step two is to integrate let's add 1 to the exponent and then divide by that result so negative 3 plus 1 is negative 2 so we have X to the negative 2 power divided by negative 2 so after you integrate it and then rewrite it and simplify so let's move the X variable to the bottom and so this becomes we can leave a 1 on top this negative side and we could transfer it to the top the 2 has to stay on the bottom but now we have an x squared on the bottom as well so the answer is a negative 1 over 2 x squared plus C now what about this one let's integrate 8 over X to the 4 DX so go ahead and try it now because we have a constant on the top I recommend moving it to the front at the same time let's move the X variable to the top so this is going to be 8 times the integral of x to the negative 4 DX and now let's find an antiderivative so let's use the power rule for integration negative 4 plus 1 is negative 3 now what we need to do is take the X variable and move it to the bottom and we could take the negative side and move it to the top so we're gonna have negative 8/3 X cubed plus C and so that's it for this example now let's integrate this expression 1 over 4x minus 3 squared DX go ahead and try that now for this type of problem I recommend you using u substitution let's make u equal to 4x minus 3 so D U is going to be the derivative of 4x minus 3 which is just 4 and then multiply that by DX now let's solve for DX so DX is going to be d u divided by 4 if you divide both sides by 4 here so we're gonna be placed in this expression with the u variable and we're gonna replace the DX with D U divided by 4 so this is going to be the integral of 1 over u squared times D u over 4 now let's take the 4 and move it to the front and let's take the U variable move it to the top so this becomes 1 over 4 integration U to the negative 2 D u now let's use the power rule so let's add 1 to the exponent so negative 2 plus 1 that's going to be negative 1 and then we need to divide by negative 2 plus 1 or negative 1 now let's move the u variable to the bottom and let's move the negative sign to the top so this is going to be negative run over 4 times u plus C now the last thing we need to do is replace the u variable with 4x minus 3 so the final answer is going to be a negative 1 over 4 times four X minus three plus C and so that's what we need to do in this problem here's another similar example find the antiderivative of 7 over 5 X minus 3 to the fourth power go ahead and try that problem so first let's use u-substitution let's make you equal to 5x minus 3 so d-u is going to be the derivative of 5x minus 3 which is 5 times DX now what I like to do is I always like to solve for DX it just it helps me to avoid mistakes and so D you over 5 is DX now let's replace 5x minus 3 with the you variable unless replace DX with D u over 5 so this is going to be the integral of 7 over U to the 4 times D u over 5 now let's take the 7 and the 5 and move it to the front and let's take the you variable and move it to the top so this is going to be 7 over 5 integral U to the negative 4 D u so now let's use the power rule negative 4 plus 1 is negative 3 and Nitze divided by negative 4 plus 1 now let's move the you variable to the bottom and let's move the negative sign to the top so this is going to be negative 7 on the bottom we have 5 times 3 which is 15 and then you to the 3rd power plus C now the last step is to replace the U variable with 5x minus 3 let's see if I can fit it here so it's going to be negative 7 over 15 times 5x minus 3 to the third power plus the constant of integration and so this is the final answer that's all we need to do in that example now what is the antiderivative of 1 over X go ahead and try that problem now if we try to approach this problem like the other problems instinctively we may decide to move the X variable to the top and this will give us X to the negative 1 if we use the power rule at this point it's going to be negative 1 plus 1 divided by negative 1 plus 1 plus C negative 1 plus 1 is 0 X to the 0 is 1 but 1 divided by 0 is undefined and so we're going to have some issues here so there must be something else that we could do you simply need some known that the antiderivative of 1 over X is Ln X because if you recall the derivative of Ln U with respect to X it's going to be u prime over u and so the derivative of Ln X is going to be if u equals x u prime is the derivative of X which is 1 so it's 1 over X so if the derivative of Ln X is 1 of X the antiderivative of 1 over X is Ln X so that's one of those formulas that you need to commit to memory try this problem find the antiderivative of 7 over X DX now this is very similar to the previous problem we just have a number on top let's move that constant to the front so this becomes 7 integral 1 over X DX now we know the antiderivative of 1 over X you just need to know that it's Ln X and so this is our answer 7 Ln X plus C now what about this one and one over X plus five what is the antiderivative of that this is going to be Ln X plus five plus C now sometimes some textbooks they may have an absolute value with the natural log symbol because X plus five can sometimes be negative for certain X values and so you might see an absolute value expression here now we can get the same answer using use substitution so if we were to make u equal to X plus 5 D U is going to be the derivative of x plus five which is 1 times DX so let's replace X plus 5 with U and D ax with two you and so this gives us Ln U plus C and then we need to replace U with X plus five and so we get Ln X plus five plus C and so you could show your work used in both techniques 

Transcript for: Finding The Area Under The Curve Using Definite Integrals - Calculus
let's start with this problem find the area of the region bounded by the curve y = x^2 from X = 0 to x = 3 now before we work on this problem let's go over some generic formulas let's say we have a graph and we have a function and let's say this is point a and point B and we want to find find the area underneath this curve in other words you want to find the area between this curve and the x axis and let's say this curve is y = f ofx to determine the area under the curve it's going to be the integral from A to B of f ofx DX so we just got to find the value of the definite integral from A to B and that's going to give us the area area of the region now you also have this variant of the same formula so let's say the curve looks like this and we want to calculate the area bounded by the curve and instead of the xaxis it's going to be with the Y AIS so we want to find the area of this shaded region in this case we want this curve to be in terms of Y instead of X so here this is a function of X what we need to find is a function of Y now Y is equal to F ofx so Y is a function of X but in this case G it's a function of Y so G of Y is going to equal x make sure you see the difference here here we have y is equal to F ofx here we have X is equal to G of Y now to calculate the area for the second situation we need to find the definite integral from C to D so those are y values of G of Y Dy so make sure you understand that key Difference A and B are X values C and D are y values but for this particular problem we're going to use this form to calculate the area now the first thing we should do is we should draw a picture so we have y equal x^2 which looks like this and we want to find a region bounding by the curve from 0 to 3 so we only need the right side of that graph so this is zero let's say this point is three we're looking for the area of this region here so using the formula the area is going to be the definite integral from A to B of f ofx DX so a is Zer B is three those are the limits of integration and remember Y is equal to F ofx and in this problem Y is x² so f ofx is x^2 Now using the power rule the anti-derivative of X2 is going to be we're going to add one to two so we'll get three and then we're going to divide by that result now we're going to evaluate it from A to B from 0 to 3 so first we're going to plug in three this is going to be 3 3 over 3 and then we're going to plug in zero so it's 0 to the 3 over 3 3 3r is 27 ID 3 is 9 so the area of the region Bound By The Curve is equal to 9 square units now let's try this problem find the area of the region bounded by the curve y = 4 - x^2 from X = 0 to x = 2 so let's begin by drawing a picture now we know that positive x^2 looks like this negative x^2 is a parabola that opens downward now that Parabola is shifted four units up so instead of starting from the origin it's going to start four units above that so our graph is going to look like this now it's always good to find the X intercepts to find the x intercept set y equal to Z and solve for x so what we have is the difference of perfect squares so we could use the formula a^ 2us B2 to factor it into a + b time a minus B so the square < TK of 4 is 2 and the square < TK of x^2 is X so this is going to be 2 + x and 2 - x if you set the first Factor equal to zero you're going to get X is equal to -2 and if you set the second Factor equal to zero and if you solve for x you'll get X is equal to pos2 so this intercept is at -2 this one is at positive2 now we want to find the area of the region bounded by the curve from 0 to pos2 so only just the right side of this graph so using the formula the area is the definite integral from A to B F ofx DX we have that the area is going to be the integral from 0 to 2 and F ofx is y so that is 4 - x^2 and then DX now the anti-derivative of the constant 4 is simply just 4X for x^2 we know it's X Cub over 3 and we're going to evaluate it from 0 to 2 so first we're going to plug in two so this is 4 * 2 - 2 3r over 3 and then we'll plug in 0 so 4 * 0 - 03r over 3 4 * 2 is 8 2 to the 3r power 2 * 2 * 2 that's 8 as well and everything here is simply zero now in order to combine these two numbers we have a fraction and a whole number we need to get common denominators so I'm going to multiply eight by 3 over3 so this is going to be 24 over 3 - 8 over 3 24 - 8 is 16 so the area of the Shaded region is going to be 16 over3 square units now let's move on to number three find the area of the region bounded by the line yal X from xal -4 to xal 4 so let's start with a picture and here is the line yal X or at least a rough sketch of it somewhere over here it's going to be ne4 and somewhere over here we have pos4 so we want to find the area of these two shaded regions now it's important to understand that if you take the indefinite integral from -4 to 4 if you integrate it you're going to get a value of zero the area on the right this is going to be a positive value because it's above the x- axis the area on the left that you'll get will be a negative value because it's below the x- axis now typically when you're solving problems like this if it tells you to find the area you're typically want a positive value now there's two ways in which we could do this we could basically take this side and multiply it by two or we could break this up into two separate integrals this one will be positive but this one we can add a negative sign to it to make it positive but due to symmetry we can say that the area is simply going to be twice the value of the right side so if we integrate it from 0 to 4 and then simply double our answer we're going to get the area of the curve or I mean the area of the Shaded region so the anti-derivative of X is going to be x^2 / 2 and if we integrate it from 0 to 4 I mean evaluated from 0 to 4 the twos will cancel so we just have x^2 from 0 to 4 and if we plug in four this is going to be 4^ squar if we plug in zero and we're going to get 16 in total so that is the area of these two shaded regions it's 16 square units now we could confirm this answer using geometry so let's focus on the top right part what we have is a triangle the base of the triangle is 4 now the equation is y is equal to X so when X is 4 Y is 4 which means this triangle has a height of four now the area of a triangle is 1 12 base time height so 12 4 * 4 4 * 4 is 16 half of that is 8 so the area of this this triangle is8 and the area of the other triangle is also eight when you add the two together you get 16 so be careful with problems where you're dealing with negative areas or where the region is below the x-axis if you have a symmetrical situation like this you could just calculate the area of the right side and multiply it by two that will give you the entire answer in other cases if you don't have symmetry you need to do it this way so the area will be the integral from 0 to 4 x DX that will give us the area of the right side and then minus the integral from -4 to 0 x DX so this part will give us a negative area time -1 that'll make this positive 8 and will help us get the the right answer so that's how you can calculate the total area of the region bottom bind of the curve for Regions that are above the x-axis you can put a positive sign for Regions that are below the x-axis add a negative sign to it so that your overall answer will be positive number four find the area of the region bounded by the curve y = x^2 + 6 x - 8 and the X axis so what we have here is a quadratic equation and when you whenever you have it in standard form it's good to find the X intercepts so right now it's x^2 + 6 x - 8 so to find the X intercepts we need to replace y with z now I'm going to factor out Nega 1 so this becomes x^2 - 6 x + 8 so we have a trinomial where the leading coefficient is one so to factor it we need to find two numbers that multiply to 8 but add to the middle coefficient -6 so those two numbers will be -2 and -4 -2 +4 adds up to -6 but -2 * -4 multiplies to POS 8 so to factor this expression it's going to be x - 2 * x - four using the zero product property if we set each factor equal to zero we'll get the two intercepts x = 2 and x = 4 which I'm going to rewrite it here now notice that we have a parabola but with a negative in front of the X squ term so that means that the parola is going to open downward with this information we can draw a rough sketch accurate enough that will help us to get the right answer so we have an intercept at two and another one at four and the graph will look something like this let me use a different color so the region bounded by the curve and the x axis has to be none other than this region here so we need to integrate it from 2 to 4 from One X intercept to the other x intercept so the area is going to be the definite integral from 2 to 4 of the original expression x^2 + 6x - 8 so the anti-derivative of x^2 is going to be X Cub over 3 for X it will simply be x^2 over 2 and for a constant we just need to add an X to it so just to simplify this expression we have -1 over 3 x cub and 6 over 2 is 3 so this is + 3x^2 and then - 8X evaluated from 2 to 4 so let's begin by plugging in four and then minus now let's use the lower limit of integration let's plug in two and now at this point we just got to do the math so 4 Cub is 64 4 2 is 16 * 3 that's 48 8 * 4 is 32 2 to the 3 is 8 so this becomes 8 over 3 2^ 2 is 4 * 3 is 12 8 * 2 is 16 so right now we have -64 over 3 48 - 32 that's pos6 here we need to distribute the negative sign so this is going to be positive 8 over3 12 - 16 is -4 times the ne 1 out in front here that's going to be pos4 now we can combine these two since they're like terms -64 + 8 is -56 and then 16 + 4 is 20 I'm going to write that as 20 over 1 and then to get common denominators I'm going to multiply the top and bottom by three so a = -56 over 3 and then 20 * 3 is 60 56 + 60 is 4 so the total area of the Shaded region is 4 over3 square units now let's work on one more problem find the area of the region bounded by the curve y = 3x - x^2 from x = -2 to x = 3 well let's begin by drawing a graph and let's find the X intercepts so let's replace y with z for this one I'm going to factor out an x 3X / X is 3x^2 / X ISX now if we set each factor equal to zero we get x = 0 and here we get 3 - x is 0 add in X to both sides we get X 3 so we have an intercept at x = 0 and at x = 3 which means and we have a negative in front of the X squ so we know the parabola it opens downward kind of like this now I'm going to have to extend this side a little bit longer the reason for that is we want to integrate it or find the area from -2 to pos3 so we're going to need this part of the graph as well as this part so here we have a positive area and here we have a negative area but we can't use Symmetry and just take one side and multiply by two we have to break this into two separate integrals so let's call this area 1 and we'll call this area 2 the total area is going to be the absolute value of area 2 plus Area 1 now area 2 is positive so once we remove the absolute value symbol it's just A2 A1 is a negative value so in order to keep it positive we need to add a negative sign to it so the total positive area is going to be A2 minus A1 in this example now this area is simply the definite integral from 0 to 3 of the function 3x - x^2 now for the other one we have negative we need to integrate it from -2 to 0o but we're dealing with the same function 3x - x^2 so now that we have this expression all we got to do is just do the work so the anti-der dtive of 3x is going to be 3x^2 / 2 and for x^2 it's just X Cub over 3 and here it's going to be evaluated from 0 to three and then for the second part we'll have the same expression but we need to keep in mind that there's a negative sign in front of it but this time we're going to evaluate it from -2 to 0 so substituting three into this expression we have 3 * 3^2 / 2 minus 3 3r over 3 and then when we plug in zero this entire thing will be zero so this is just area two now for this part once we plug in zero everything is zero and then minus we need to plug in -2 so it's going to be 3 * -2 2 / 2us -2 3r over 3 3^ 2 is 9 * 3 that's 27 so this is 27 over 2 here 3 3r is 27 / 3 so this is going to be 9 and then minus and then we have another negative sign here the zero we could just not worry about -2 2 is 4 / 2 is 2 * 3 that's going to be 6 here we have -2 3r that's -8 * A-1 that's POS 8 so Plus 8 over3 all right these two negative signs will cancel so that's just going to be positive so we can just write it out like this plus 6 + 8 over3 -9 + 6 that's going to be -3 now what we need to do at this point is we need to get common denominators so let's try to get a common denominator of 6 so -3 over 1 I'm going to multiply by 6 over 6 27 over2 I'm going to multiply by 3 over 3 and 8 over3 I'm going to multiply by 2 over 2 so this is -8 over 6 27 * 3 20 * 3 is 60 7 * 3 is 21 when you add 60 and 21 you get 81 and 8 * 2 is 16 -8 + 16 that's going to be -2 so we have 81 over 6 - 2 over 6 and 81 - 2 is 79 so we have 79 over 6 and if we want to we can break this up so that we can get a mixed fraction 79 is 60 + 18 + 1 60 / 6 is 10 18 ID 6 is 3 and we have this so 10 + 3 is 13 so we have 13 + 1 6 whereas a mixed fraction 13 and 16 so the total area we can leave it as an improper fraction 79 over 6 or we could leave it as a mixed number 13 and 16 so that's basically it for this video now you know how to calculate the area under the curve I do have other videos in calculus that is related to this topic such as how to calculate the area between curves now you could do a YouTube search to find that video or you could check out the links in the description section below I also have other videos like uh the disc method you know how to calculate the volume using the disc method the shell method and by using cross-sections so feel free to take a look at those videos when you get a chance and thanks for watching consider this problem find the area of the Shaded region bounded by the curves y = x^2 + 1 and y equal 4 as shown on the screen now this one there's different ways in which we can do this but let's use this formula the area is the integral from C to D of G of Y Dy now recall that Y is f ofx and X is G of Y so if you're using this formula what you need to do is you need to solve for y in this equation I mean not y but you need to solve for x in that equation so we have y is = x^2 + 1 solving for x we have y - 1 is equal to x^2 so X is going to be the square < TK of y - one and since X is G of y g of Y is the square < TK of Y -1 now the next thing we need to know are our C and D values this is D and this is C it's very clear for us to see that D is equal to four d c and d are y values C is 1 because when X is z y is equal to 1 using that formula so the area is the integral of 1: 4 of G of Y which is the square T of y - one which we can write it like this it's y - 1 ra to 12 Dy so let's go ahead and find the anti-derivative of that expression so we're going to add 1 to 12 which is 32 and then we're going to divide by 32 which is the same as multiplying it by 2 over 3 the derivative of y- one is just one so we don't need to worry about that if you were to use U substitution we would still get this answer now let's EV Val from 1 to 4 so this is 2 raised to the Yus who this is 2 * 4 - 1 raed to 3 over 2 over 3 and then minus 2 * 1 - 1 over 3 so 4 - 1 is 3 1 - 1 is just zero so right now we have 2 over 3 3 to the 3es that's 3 to the 3r raised to the 12 3 3r is 27 so this is 2 < TK 27 over 3 now the sare otk of 27 we could simplify that as thek of 9 * thek of 3 thek of 9 is 3 and so we could cancel that so we get that the area is 2 < tk3 so that is the area of the Shader region for this problem so that's how you can get the answer in terms of Y now the other method involves finding in the area between two curves and we can do it in terms of X so let's say we have two functions let's say the top function is f ofx the bottom function is G ofx and we want to find the area of the Shaded region between those two functions in this case the area is going to be the difference it's the definite integral from A to B and it's the difference of the top function f minus the bottom function G so if we're going to apply this formula to this problem instead of using C and D values we're going to be using A and B values since it's going to be in terms of X instead of Y so in this case this is going to be a and this is going to be B so a is xal 0 B is wherever this curve intersects the line yal 4 so we have to solve for that in order to find Bean we need to set these two equal to each other and we need to solve for x so 4 is going to equal x^2 + 1 subtracting both sides by 1 we get 3 is equal to x^2 so X is going to be the square < TK of 3 so B is positive < tk3 and this part here is root3 but we don't need that now in this example the top function is the line yal 4 so that's going to be F ofx the bottom function is the curve X2 + 1 so that's our G of X so using this formula we have this set up the area is going to be the integral from A to B A is0 B is the < TK of 3 and then f is 4 minus G which is x² + 1 so we could simplify this expression 4 - 1 is 3 so this simplifies to 3 - x^2 if we distribute the negative sign anti-derivative of 3 is 3x for x^2 it's going to be X Cub over 3 evaluated from 0 to < tk3 so plugging in root3 we have 3 * < tk3 minus < tk3 to the 3 power over three and all of that minus zero so < tk3 to the 3 power so basically we have it three times if we multiply the square root of 3 * the < TK of 3 we're going to get the sare < TK of 9 and the squ < TK of 9 is three so we have this and 3 / 3 is 1 so we have 3 < tk3 - 1 < tk3 and 3 - 1 is 2 so we get the area is 2 < tk3 so those are two ways in which you can calculate the area of the Shader region you can do it in terms of X or you can do it in terms of Y depending on how you want to set up the problem just remember if you do it in terms of X you need to use a and b which are X values if you do it in terms of Y you need to use C and D which are y values 

Transcript for: Area Between Two Curves
in this video we're going to talk about how to calculate the area between two curves so let's go over the basics let's say we have some function f of x and we want to find the area under the curve from a to b so we're looking for the area of the shaded region the area is simply the definite integral from a to b of f of x dx now let's say if we have another function from a to b and let's call this function g of x the area under this curve is going to be the integral from a to b but of g of x dx now what happens if we want to find the area between two curves so let's say if we have both f of x let me draw this better and g of x how can we find the area between these two curves all we need to do is take the difference between this area and this area and we'll get the area between f and g of x so that area is simply the integral of a to b f of x minus g of x dx so that's how you could find the area between the two curves you need to take the difference between the top function and subtract it by the bottom function and then take the definite integral of that difference and you'll get the area of that curve now let's say if we have another function we'll call this function f of y and let's say it varies from c to d along the y axis and we want to calculate the area from c to d between that curve and the y axis the area of that region is going to be the integral from c to d of f of y d y so that function is basically x is equal to some function of y now let's say if we want to find the area between two curves so let's say we have f of y and g of y going from c to d so instead of taking the top function and subtracting by the bottom function what we're going to do is we're going to take the integral from c to d of the function on the right which is f of y minus the function on the left which is g of y and so that's how we can get the area between two curves from c to d when using y values so remember when dealing with f of x it's y is equal to f of x when dealing with f of y its x is equal to f of y now let's go ahead and work on some practice problems calculate the area of the region bounded by the line y equals 8 minus 2x the x-axis and the y-axis well let's begin by drawing a picture so y equals 8 minus 2x let's get the x and y-intercepts since we're dealing with a linear equation when x is 0 this is going to be 8 minus 2 times 0 which is 8. and if we replace y with 0 and solve for x we can see that x is going to be 8 divided by 2 which is 4. so we have a y-intercept of 8 and the x-intercept of 4. so we want to find the area between this line the x-axis and the y-axis so one way we can do this is through the use of geometry we know that the area of a triangle is one-half base times height the base is four the height is eight half of two is i mean half of four is two times eight that's 16. so that's the area of the shaded region but let's use calculus to get this answer as well so we know the area between a curve and the x-axis is going to be the integral from a to b of f of x dx and as we know y is equal to f of x and y is eight minus two x so f of x can be replaced with eight minus two x and along the x axis we're gonna integrate it from 0 to 4. so we're going to have the integral of or from 0 to 4 f of x which is 8 minus 2x and then dx so the anti-derivative of 8 is 8x and the anti-derivative of 2x to the first power is 2x squared over 2. so we can cross out the 2. so it's just 8x minus x squared so now let's plug in four so it's going to be eight times four minus four squared and then we'll plug in zero so it's eight times zero minus zero squared eight times four is thirty two four squared is sixteen and everything on the right will be zero and thirty two minus sixteen is sixteen so we get the same answer and it's confirmed so that's how you can calculate the area of the region using this particular definite integral now we can also get the same answer in terms of y as opposed to in terms of x so we can integrate it from c to d using this formula so remember x is equal to f of y so what we need to do to get a function of y is we need to solve for x so we have y is equal to 8 minus 2x i'm going to move this to the left side where it's going to be positive 2x and i'm going to move y to the right side where it's going to be negative y and now let's divide everything by two so we get x is equal to four minus one half y so therefore we could say that f of y is equal to four minus one half y we're going to integrate it from c to d or 0 to 8. so the area is going to be the integral from 0 to 8 f of y which is 4 minus one half y and then d y so the anti-derivative of four is going to be 4y the antiderivative of y to the first power is y to the second power over two evaluated from zero to eight so this is four y minus one fourth times y squared so let's plug in eight we're gonna have four times eight minus one fourth times eight squared and then once we plug in zero into this expression the whole thing is going to be zero so four times eight is thirty-two and then 8 squared is 64. 64 times 1 4 is 16. so this 2 will give us the same answer of 16 square units for the area so regardless if we choose to find the area in terms of x or in terms of y we're going to get the same answer let's work on this problem calculate the area of the region bounded by the line y equals x and y equals x squared y equals x is basically a straight line that passes through the origin at an angle of 45 degrees so that's y equals x y equals x squared is basically a parabola that opens upward but starts at the origin so if we put those two graphs together we're going to get something that looks like this so here's the line y equals x and here is y equals x squared on the right side on the left side it just looks like that but we don't need to worry about it the area of the region bounded by these two curves is right here so that's the area that we need to calculate what we need to do is we need to determine the points of intersection we can see the first point is going to be at zero but we got to find the second point to do that we want to set these two equal to each other so we want to set x equal to x squared subtracting both sides by x we'll get that zero is equal to x squared minus x and then if we factor out the gcf if we factor out x we'll get this expression using the zero product property we can see that x is equal to zero and x is also equal to one so those are the points of intersection now the top function is our f of x function which is y equals x the bottom function is our g of x function which is x squared so now we can calculate the area between the two curves using this formula it's the definite integral from a to b of the top function f of x minus the bottom function g of x so this is going to be the integral from 0 to 1. f of x is x g of x is x squared the antiderivative of x is going to be x squared over 2 and for x squared using the power rule it's x to the third over three so let's plug in one this is going to be one squared over two minus one to the third over three and then if we plug in zero this whole thing will be zero so it's one half minus one over three let's multiply one half by three over three and one over three by two over two to get common denominators so this becomes three over six this becomes two over six and our final answer is one over six so this is the area between the two curves it's one over six square units number three calculate the area of the region bounded by the curves y equal x squared and x equal y squared so let's graph these two functions separately so this is y is equal to x squared it's a parabola that opens upward now x equals y squared it opens towards the right if you take the square root of both sides you'll get that y is equal to square root of x plus or minus the top part of this function is y is equal to positive root x the bottom part is y is equal to negative square root x now if we focus on quadrant one where the two curves meet this is y is equal to x squared and this is x is equal to y squared so now this here is the top function which is f of x which is basically that function x is equal to y squared but solving for y we know that it's the square root of x is equal to y and f of x is equal to y and remember f of y is equal to x so be careful don't get those confused so we can replace f of x with the stuff that equals y which is the square root of x the bottom function is y is equal to x squared and so that's our g of x function g of x is also equal to y just a different type of y so this is x squared and our goal is to calculate the area of the shaded region so first we need to find the points of intersection so let's set f of x equal to g of x so f of x in terms of x is the square root of x g of x is x squared if we square both sides we'll get that x is equal to x to the fourth now this is true when x is zero zero is equal to zero to the fourth and this is true when x is equal to one one is equal to one to the fourth power so those the points of intersection now that we have that we can calculate the area using this formula so the area is going to be the definite integral of a to b or zero to one of the top function which is the square root of x but we'll write that as x to the one-half minus the bottom function which is x squared so the antiderivative of x to the one half we need to add one to one half which is three over two and then instead of dividing by three over two we're going to multiply by the reciprocal two over three the anti-derivative of x squared is x cubed over three now let's plug in one so this is going to be two over three minus one over three and when we plug in zero we'll just get zero so the final answer is just one over three so that's the area between it's the area of the region bounded by these two curves so that's the final answer now let's move on to number four calculate the area of the region bounded by the curves x is equal to one minus y squared and x is equal to y squared minus one so first let's talk about how we can graph this we know that x is equal to y squared looks like this if that's x equal y squared what is x equal y squared minus one all we need to do is take this curve and subtract it by one along the x axis so it's going to move one unit to the left it's going to start at x equals negative one so that's the shape of this graph it shifted horizontally one unit to the left so now that we have the graph of that function let's focus on the graph of this function now x is equal to x equals positive y squared opens to the right what about x equal negative y squared what happens then so this is going to open to the left it's reflected about the y axis now what if we add a 1 to it when we subtracted by one the graph started at negative one if we add one it's going to start at positive one so x equals negative y squared plus one we're going to move one unit to the right so this is the same as x is equal to one minus y squared so what we need to do is combine these two graphs together so it's going to look something like this and this is going to be the area of the region bounded by those two curves so let's redraw that picture so here we have y squared minus one and here we have actually this was one minus y squared and this one is going to be y squared minus 1. so let me write that so this is x is equal to y squared minus 1 and this other one here is x is equal to one minus y squared so how can we determine the area of the region bounded by these two curves we need to find the points of intersection first so let's set these two expressions equal to each other and since we have x in terms of y the points of intersection will be y values so let's set one minus y squared equal to y squared minus one so let's add y squared to both sides and let's add one to both sides so those will cancel we'll get 2 is equal to 2y squared dividing both sides by 2 we get 1 is equal to y squared and then if we take the square root of both sides we get 1 is equal to plus or minus 1 which should be written this way so this is a y value of negative 1 and this is a y value of positive 1. so now that we have the y values of the points of intersection we can calculate the area between the two curves using this formula it's going to be the integral from c to d which are y values of the right function f of y minus the left function g of y so f of y is here f of y is one minus y squared we could see it here instead of the function on the right g of y is the function on the left this is g of y it's on the left side for the region that's bounded so g of y is y squared minus 1. so now we could use this formula it's going to be the integral from c to d c is negative 1 d is positive 1. and then f of y which is 1 minus y squared minus g of y which is y squared minus 1 d y so let's simplify this expression first this is one minus y squared minus y squared and then these two negative signs will become positive one so one plus one is two negative y squared minus y squared is negative two y squared the antiderivative of 2 is 2y and for 2y squared we have 2y to the third over 3 it from negative one to one so let's plug in one this is going to be two times one minus two times one to the third over three and then if we plug in negative 1 we'll get this so this becomes 2 minus 2 over 3 and then negative two plus two over three distributing the negative sign will have plus two minus two over three now let's combine like terms two plus two is four negative two over three minus two over three that's negative four over three so what we need to do now is we need to get common denominators so four over one i'm going to multiply that by three over three so this becomes twelve over three minus four over three which gives me a final answer of eight over three so this here is the area between the two curves now let's work on some more practice problems calculate the area of the region bounded by the line y equals x squared minus 4x and the x axis x squared we know opens like this x squared minus 4x is going to be similar but it's going to be shifted so what we need to do is to graph this we need to find the x-intercepts and the vertex so to find the x-intercepts let's replace y with zero let's solve for x so i'm going to factor out x using a zero product property we get an x intercept of 0 and a 4. so let's make a table so when x is 0 y is 0. when x is 4 y is also 0. now the vertex of a parabola is the midpoint of the x-intercepts so it's going to be at 2. another way you can in which you can get the vertex is by using this equation x is equal to negative b over 2a let's say if you have a quadratic equation ax squared plus bx plus c so a is the number in front of x squared which is one b is the number in front of x which is negative 4. so we have negative b over 2a so this is positive 4 over 2 which gives us an x value of 2. now we need to determine the y value to do that we can just plug it into this expression so y is equal to x times x minus four if we plug in two this is two times two minus four so we get two times negative two which is negative four so we have enough information whoops let's go back so we have enough information to graph this function now so we have an x intercept of zero and four and that negative four we have the vertex at an x value of 2. so the graph is a parabola that opens upward like this our goal is to calculate the area of the region bounded by that line well technically that should be a curve not a line so let's just replace that with the word curve and the x-axis so how can we find the area of that shaded region well we need to identify the top function and the bottom function the top function is the x-axis and that's basically the line y equals zero so we can say the top function is f of x is equal to zero the bottom function g of x is the curve x squared minus 4x and we're going to integrate this from 0 to four so let's use this formula it's going to be the integral from a to b of the top function f of x minus the bottom function g of x so this is going to be the definite integral from zero to four the top function is zero the bottom function is negative well it's minus x squared minus 4x so let's go ahead and distribute the negative sign so negative times negative 4x that's going to be positive 4x and then minus x squared the antiderivative of 4x is going to be 4x squared over 2. and for x squared is going to be x cubed over 3. so this becomes two x squared so we have two x squared minus x cubed over three evaluated from zero to four so let's plug in four when we plug in zero this whole thing is going to be zero four squared is sixteen times two that's thirty two four to the third is sixty four so we have sixty four three now we need to get common denominators let's multiply 32 over one by three over three 32 times 3 is 96 so we have 96 over 3 minus 64 over 3 and 96 minus 64 is 32. so the area of the shaded region is 32 over 3. that's the answer for this problem number six calculate the area of the region bounded by the equations y equal x squared minus 4x and y equals 6 minus 3x so this equation we're familiar with already we know the x-intercepts will be 0 and four and we know that the vertex will be at two negative four so this graph is going to open upward like this so that's a rough sketch now here we have a linear equation y equals 6 minus 3x so the y-intercept is 6 which should be somewhere here and to determine the x-intercept we can replace y with 0 and solve for x so adding 3x to both sides we have 3x is equal to 6 and 6 divided by 3 is 2. so this line is going to touch the x axis at 2. so that's what we have and eventually this curve is going to meet up with this line so our goal is to get the area of the shaded region what we need to determine is the points of intersection here and here so we need to calculate the area by taking the top function and subtracting it by the bottom function so we want the x values of the points of intersection so let's set these two functions equal to each other x squared minus 4x we're going to set that equal to 6 minus 3x so let's begin by let's add 3x to both sides and let's subtract both sides by 6. so on the left side we'll have x squared negative 4x plus 3x that's going to be negative x and then we have negative 6. so we could factor x squared minus x minus six two numbers that multiply to negative six but add to the middle coefficient negative one are negative three and plus two so we can write this as x minus three times x plus two solving for x we get that x is equal to positive 3 and if you set x plus 2 equal to 0 you'll get that x is equal to negative 2. so here's the first point of intersection this is at an x value of three and this is at an x value of negative two and the top function that's f of x which is it's this linear equation 6 minus 3x the bottom function g of x is the other one that's x squared minus 4x so now let's calculate the area using this formula so it's going to be the integral from a to b that is from negative two to three f of x which is six minus three x minus g of x which is x squared minus four x so we have 6 this is negative 3x minus negative 4x which is negative 3x plus 4x so that's simply plus x and then we have negative x squared now let's clear away a few things the anti-derivative of 6 is going to be 6x 4x is going to be x squared over two and for x squared it's going to be x to the third over three evaluate it from negative two to three now let's plug in three so we're gonna have six times three plus three squared over two minus three to the third power over three and now let's plug in negative two six times three is eighteen three squared is nine three to the third is 27 divided by three that's nine and then we have negative six times negative two is negative twelve negative two squared is four divided by two is positive two negative two to the third power is negative eight with the negative in front that becomes positive eight but divided by three so here we can combine eight i mean eighteen and negative nine eighteen minus nine is nine and here we have negative twelve plus two which is negative ten and then plus 8 over 3. distributing the negative sign we have 9 plus 9 over 2 and then we have plus 10 minus 8 over 3. so first let's combine nine and ten so that's just nineteen and then let's focus on combining those two fractions let's try to get a common denominator of six so nineteen over one i'm going to multiply that by six over six nine over two i'm going to multiply that by three over three and eight over three i'm gonna multiply that by two over two nineteen times six is a hundred and fourteen nine times three is twenty-seven eight times two is sixteen twenty seven minus sixteen is eleven and one fourteen plus eleven is one twenty five so this is the final answer this is the area of the shaded region it's 125 over 6. number seven so we want to find the area of the region bounded by these two equations we get a linear equation and a parabolic equation let's begin by graphing the parabolic equation so we have x equals y squared which we know it's going to open towards the right but it's going to start at negative 4 along the x-axis so it's going to look something like this now here we have a linear equation x is equal to 3y minus 2. so when y is 0 x will be negative 2. so that means that the x intercept is negative 2. now we have a positive coefficient in front of y it's positive 3y and not negative 3y so we know we're going to have a linear equation that's going to increase as x increases as y increases x is going to increase so it's going to go up so we want to find the area of the shaded region what we need to do is find the points of intersection first so let's set 3y minus 2 equal to 2y squared minus 4. so i'm going to take these numbers and move it to the other side so we're going to have 0 is equal to 2y squared this will be negative 3y on the right side and then this will be positive 2 on the right so negative 4 plus positive 2 that's going to be negative 2. so now how can we factor this trinomial where the leading coefficient is two to factor it we need to multiply the leading coefficient by the constant term two times negative two is negative four and then we need to find two numbers that multiply to negative four but add to the middle coefficient negative three this is going to be negative four and plus one so we're going to replace the middle term negative three y with negative four y plus one y and then we could factor by grouping so we're going to take out the gcf in the first two terms and that's 2y and we'll be left with y minus negative 2 and we're going to take out the gcf in the last two terms which is just going to be 1 and then times y minus 2. now these two are the same so we're going to factor out y minus 2 and we're left with 2y plus 1. so that's how we can factor this trinomial if we set y minus 2 equal to 0 we'll get y is equal to positive 2 and if we set 2 y plus 1 equal to 0 y is going to be negative 1 over 2. so now we have our points of intersection and these are y values negative 1 half and positive 2. so this is equal to c and this is equal to d since everything is in terms of y here so now we could use this formula to get the area it's going to be the integral from c to d of the function on the right which is f of y minus the function on the left which is g of y so relative to the shaded region the function on the right which is here that function is f of y which is the linear equation three y minus two the function on the left that's the curve function that's g of y which has to be the other one two y squared minus four so the area is going to be from c to d or from negative one half to two f of y which is three y minus two and then minus g of y which is two y squared minus four d y so we have three y minus two minus two y squared and then plus 4. so this becomes negative 2y squared plus 3y and then combining these two that's going to be plus 2. the antiderivative of negative two y squared will be negative two y to the third over three for three y it's 3y squared over 2 and for 2 it's 2y evaluated from negative one-half to 2. so now let's plug in two this is gonna be negative two times two to the third power over three plus three times two squared over two plus two times two and then let's plug in negative one-half so it's negative two times negative one-half to the third power over three plus three times negative one-half squared over two plus two times minus a half two to the third power is eight times negative two that's negative sixteen over three two squared is four divided by two is two times three that gives us six and then two times two is four negative one half to the third power is negative one over eight negative one over eight times negative two is positive one over four divided by three that becomes positive one over twelve negative one half squared is positive one fourth divided by two that's one over eight times three that's positive three over eight and then two times negative a half is negative one so we have negative 16 over three six plus four is ten distributing the negative sign we have negative one over twelve minus three over eight and then this is plus one so what we need to do is we need to get a common denominator of three twelve and eight the best number is 24. 24 is a multiple of 3 12 and 8. but first let's combine 10 and 1 which is 11. we're going to multiply this by 24 over 24 and then negative 16 over 3 we're going to multiply that by 8 over 8. negative 1 over 12 we'll multiply that by 2 over and negative three over eight we're gonna multiply that by three over three to get a common denominator of 24. so we have 11 times 24 which is 264 16 times 8 is 128 2 times 1 is 2 three times three is nine so two sixty four minus one twenty eight that's a hundred and thirty six and negative two minus nine is negative eleven 136 minus 11 is 125. so the answer is 125 over 24 square units so that is the area of the region bounded by the two curves or the two equations you

in this video we're going to talk about how to set up an integral that will help us to find the area that's bounded by three curves or three graphs so we're given the equation of the three graphs but we don't know the points of intersection so the first thing we need to do is we need to draw a rough sketch of these graphs so y equals x^2 we know it's a graph that opens up like this now because there's a 1/4 in front of the X2 because it's less than one the graph is going to open in a much wider fashion so instead of being narrow it's going to be wider now the graph y = < TK of X looks like this but it's been shifted two units up so it's going to start from positive two and then it will gradually go in that direction now this graph the one in the middle we have x to the first power so we're dealing with a straight line and we have a negative in front of that X term so that's going to be line that's going in this direction when X is Zer we can see Y is 2 so notice that this graph is in slope intercept form we can see m is a half and the Y intercept or B is 2 so this graph is going to start here and it's going to go down in this direction so right now we could see that this is the area that's bounded by all three curves so there's three points of interest that we need to find out here's one point of intersection here's the second point of intersection and here's the third one now the first point of intersection we know the x value is zero we need to find the other two and what we're going to do is we're going to break this into two regions so the left side we'll call it area one and the right side area two but first let's find the points of intersection so at this point of intersection we have the line - 12 x + 2 that is y is equal to that and we have the curve underneath it 14 x^2 so in order to find the point of intersection we're going to have to set these two equations equal to each other because they will have the same y value at the point of intersection so we're going to have - 12x + 2 is = 14 x^2 so the first thing I'm going to do is get rid of all the fractions I'm going to multiply everything by 4 so -2 * 4 is -2 2 * 4 is 8 1/4 * 4 is 1 so we get this now I'm going to move everything from the left side to the right side so this becomes x^2 + 2x - 8 now it looks like we can Factor this trinomial so two numbers that multiply to 8 but add to the middle coefficient 2 that's going to be pos4 and -2 so this is going to factor out to being x - 2 x + 4 -2 * 4 is8 -2 + 4 gives us pos2 so using a zero product property and setting each factor equal to Z if we set x - 2 = to 0 we'll get X is equal to 2 if we set x + 4 equal to Z and solve for x we'll get that X is equal to -4 so at -4 these two graphs will intersect but we don't need that point this is the one that we need at x = 2 is where they're going to meet now remember this graph is not drawn a scale but as long as we can identify the points of intersection and where the Shaded region is going to be even if we don't have the most accurate graph we can still get the right answer now we need to find the next point of intersection and so we need to set this equation equal to this one so we're going to set these two equations equal to each other cuz this top curve represents this equation so we're going to have the < TK x + 2 is = 14 x^2 now what I'm going to do is I'm going to subtract both sides by two so instead of having positive two I'm going to have -2 on the right side now to get rid of the fractions I'm going to multiply everything by 4 so this is going to be 4 < TK X = x^2 - 8 now to get rid of the square root symbol I'm going to have to square both sides on the Left 4 S is 16 the square root of x^2 is just X on the right side I'm going to I need to foil this expression so here we're going to have x to the 4th this is going to be 8x^2 plus another 8x^2 which is -16 x^2 and then 8 * 8 is postive 64 this is going to be a little challenging to factor you could solve these equations with a graph and calculator or you can plug in numbers until it works so moving the term to the left side the 16x it will be -6x on the right side now let's see if we can Factor this polinomial so I'm going to factor out the GCF we're going to factor by grouping so let's take out the GCF or the greatest common factor in the first two terms which is going to be x^2 x 4 / x^2 that's that's x^2 and -16 x^2 / x^2 is -16 in the last two terms I'm going to factor out -16 so -6x / -16 is X POS 64 / -16 is -4 now x^2 - 16 we have the difference of two squares so to factor it it's going to be the square otk of x^2 which is X and the square otk of 16 is 4 one of them is going to be positive the other will be negative now notice that we have a common factor and that is x - 4 so we could factor out x - 4 once we take out x - 4 from this term we'll be left with what's left over and that is x^2 * x + 4 and once we take it out out of the second term we're left with -6 now we don't really have to worry about anything here all we need to do is set this Factor equal to zero then the entire thing will be equal to zero so when we set x - 4 equal to Z we'll get X is equal to 4 and that is going to be the point of intersection that we're looking for and we could verify if you plug in four into this equation 4^ 2 is 16 * 1/4 you get Y is equal to 4 and if you plug in four here theun of 4 is 2 plus another two you get Y is equal to 4 so we have the Y value at this point so that's the point for 4 so now that we have the points of intersection we can find the area by the way if you need to find the area between two curves let's say this is f and this is G and we want to find the area between points A and B the area for that region is going to be the definite integral from A to B of the top function f ofx minus the bottom function G of X so that's how we can calculate the area of the Shaded region using integrals so let's calculate area one for area one the top function is this equation s < TK x + 2 the bottom function is the line y = - 12x + 2 so for A1 is going to be the integral from A to B that is from 0 to 2 of the top function < tkx + 2 minus the bottom function which is - 12 x + 2 the parentheses here is important because this negative sign needs to be distributed and let's not forget the DX term now for area two we're going to integrate it from 2 to 4 the top function is the square < TK of x + 2 again the bottom part is going to be 1/4 x^2 so we're going to integrate this from 2 to 4 and this is going to beunk x + 2 minus 14 x^2 so the total area is the sum of A1 and A2 so it's the first integral from 0 to 2 squ < TK x + 2 - - 12 x x + 2 and then it's going to be plus the second integral from 2 to 4 of the < TK x + 2 -4 x^2 so that is the integral or the integral Expressions that we need in order to get the total area of the Shaded region 

Transcript for: Disk & Washer Method - Calculus
in this video we're going to talk about how to calculate the volume by rotating a region around the x-axis or the y-axis using the disc method and the washers method so let's begin let's say if we have a curve and the curve looks like this and we wish to calculate the volume of the curve from let's say a to b one method that we can use is a disc method and the disc method works by taking a cross-sectional area this is going to be the radius but if we take the cross-sectional area we can turn it into a disc as we rotate the region about the x-axis we could form basically something that looks like a disk now i'm going to draw this disk the other way notice that this forms the shape of a cylinder the cylinder has a radius r and it has a height h the volume of a cylinder is basically the volume of the cross-sectional area times the height the cross sectional area being the circle on top which is pi r squared thus the volume of the cylinder is prior square times height and so the volume of this blue disc it has a height h which you can also view it as a dx or delta x and it has a cross sectional area which is pi r squared now to find the volume of a solid we need to add up all the little discs from a to b if you make other disc there's another disc that you can make my drone is kind of terrible but basically the idea is that you add up all these smaller discs to find the total volume of the uh of the object or the solid that is created by revolving about the x-axis but to find the volume you got to find a volume of you have to integrate the cross-sectional area from a to b and the area is basically pi r squared where r is going to be a function of x and so this is the equation to find the volume using the disc method when revolving about the x-axis the main idea needs to understand is that the cross-sections that are used for this technique is basically a circle and the area of a circle is pi r squared now sometimes you may need to find the area when it's revolved or rotated about the y axis but let's just go over some basic things so if you want to find the volume rotate about the x-axis this is going to be the shader region and it has to be in terms of x so the radius is between the x-axis that's where the solid is being rotated about and it's between the curve so that's the radius in terms of x so the volume is going to be from you have to integrate the function from a to b and it's going to be r squared of x dx that's how you find the volume of the solid rotated about the x-axis now let's say if you want to find it about the y axis instead of using a and b we're going to use c and d which represent y values the radius is going to be between the y-axis and the curve since we're rotating about the y-axis so the volume is going to be pi integration from c to d r of y squared times d y so that's how you find the volume rotate about the y axis or a line parallel to the y axis and this is for the x-axis or line parallel to the x-axis all right let's start with an example let's say we have the function y is equal to the square root of x and we want to find the volume when rotating this curve about the x-axis and we want the portion of the curve where it's bounded between x is equal to zero and x is equal to four so feel free to try this problem the first thing you want to do is you want to plot the function the square root of x looks like this the radius is the distance between the curve and the axis of rotation in this case we're rotating about the x-axis and we want the portion of the curve between x is equal to zero and x is equal to four so this is the region that we want the first thing you want to do is find out what r of x is equal to r of x is equal to y which y is equal to square root x so r of x is equal to both of these things but we want it to be in terms of x so we're going to use square root x now let's use the equation the volume is equal to pi times the integration from a to b r of x and dx and let's not forget to uh square it so this is going to be pi a is 0 b is 4 r of x is the square root of x and we're going to square that and then we have dx root x squared is basically x so let's integrate this function the antiderivative of x is going to be x squared over 2. you have to add one to the exponent and then divide by that result so now let's find the value of this uh definite integral so first let's plug in four so it's going to be four squared over two and then we'll plug in zero four squared is sixteen zero squared is just zero and uh sixteen divided by two is eight so the final answer is eight pi now it's your turn find the volume of the solid generated by rotating the function y is equal to one over x about the x-axis bounded by the region x is equal to one and the line x is equal to three so feel free to pause the video and work on this example use the disk method to calculate the volume so the first thing we need to do is plot the function so the right side of 1 over x it looks like this but we only want the portion from one to three so we only want this region and we're going to rotate it about the x-axis so the radius r of x is the distance between the x-axis or the axis of rotation and the curve so r of x is simply equal to the function one of x the way you find it is you take the top part of the function or the top part of this line which is one over x minus the bottom part which is uh y is equal to zero that's the x axis so it's one over x minus zero which is just one of x now even though that process seems useless at this point it's useful when you're rotating about an axis that is neither the x or y axis which we'll cover later in this video but for now r of x is simply one of x so the volume is going to be pi integration from a to b or one to three and then it's going to be r of x squared dx so this is pi one two three one over x squared dx one over x squared we need to rewrite it we can write it as x to negative two and now let's use the power rule let's add one to the exponent negative two plus one is negative one and then we need to divide by negative 1. so rewriting the function we can bring the x back to the bottom to get rid of the negative exponent so this is going to be pi times negative one over x evaluated from one to three so this is going to be pi times negative one over three minus negative one over one always start with the top number three and then subtracted by the one on the bottom so this is basically negative one third plus one over one now we need to get common denominators so let's multiply this by three over three so what we have is negative one over three plus three over three negative one plus three is two so the final answer is just two pi over three now let's try a few examples of finding the volume of a solid when it's rotating about the y axis so let's say that y is equal to x squared and the curve is bounded by the lines x equals zero and y equals four and we're rotating about the y axis so let's begin by drawing a graph so this is the y-axis which we're rotating about and the graph y equals x squared the right side of it looks like this now this is the line x equals zero it's basically the y axis and we have the line y equals four which is basically a vertical line so this is the shaded region that's the region that we're interested in the radius is between the axis of rotation which is the y-axis and the curve so that is basically that's r of y now notice that r of y is the same as x x is the distance between the y axis and the curve so we could say that r of y is equal to x now we need to get r of y in terms of y if we want to find the volume rotate about the y axis so we need to find out what x is equal to in terms of y so we have this equation if y is equal to x squared then if we take the square root of both sides we can see that x is equal to the square root of y so let's replace x with root y so the radius in terms of y is equal to the square root of y now to find the volume of this region when it's rotated about the y axis we can use this equation v is equal to pi integration from c to d those are values on the y axis r of y d y squared at the origin the y value is zero and at the line y equals four y is four so therefore c is zero d is four r of y we know it's the square root of y and we have to square it the square root of y squared is just going to be y so now we can integrate the function the integration of y to the first power is y squared over two evaluate it from zero to four and let's not forget the constant in front so now let's plug in those numbers let's start with the top number four so it's four squared over two minus zero squared over two four squared is sixteen zero squared is just zero and sixteen divided by two is eight so the volume is going to be 8 pi now it's your turn try this example let's say y is equal to x raised to the 2 thirds and the curve is bounded by the lines x equals zero and y equals one and we're going to rotate it about the y axis find the volume of this solid that forms once you rotate this curve bounded by those lines about the y axis feel free to pause the video as you work on this example so let's begin with a graph so the graph y equals x to the two thirds it's an increase in function and it increases a decrease in rate it looks like that the line x equals zero is basically the x axis and y equals one that's a horizontal line so we can see that the y values are zero and one and we're rotating about the y axis so this is the shaded region and the radius that's r of y now once again r of y is equal to x and it turns out that r of x is equal to y now let me explain so let's say if we have this curve and we know this is x x is the distance between the y axis and the curve and that's also the radius relative to the y-axis so r of y is always going to be equal to x now the first example when we had y equals x squared and we were revolving about the x-axis r of x was the distance between the x-axis and the curve but notice that r of x is parallel to the y-axis so r of x is equivalent to y but since y is equal to x squared and if r of x is equal to y r of x is equal to x squared and that's what we did in the first example but it's important to understand that r of x is equal to y and r of y is equal to x now let's go back to this problem so if r of y is equal to x what's r of y in terms of y so now let's use the equation that we have in the beginning so we know y is equal to x raised to the two thirds so we need to solve for x and the only way we can do that is by raising both sides to three over two which is the reciprocal of two over three when you raise one exponent to another you need to multiply the two exponents two over three times three over two is one the threes cancel and the twos will cancel so you get x to the first power or simply x therefore x is y to the three over two and since r of y is equal to x then r of y is also equal to y raised to the three over two all we need to do is replace x with y to the three halves now once you have the radius in terms of y we could find the volume of the solid that is produced when rotating about the y axis so now let's use this formula so let's replace c with zero and d with one and let's replace r y with y to the three halves and let's not forget to square it y to the three-halves squared we need to multiply the two exponents three over two times two which is two over one the twos cancel so you just get three so what we now have is v is equal to pi integration zero to one y to the third d y the anti-derivative of y to the third is y to the fourth over four evaluated from zero to one multiplied by pi so let's begin by plugging in one so it's one to the fourth over four minus zero to the fourth over four one to the fourth is basically one zero to the fourth is just zero so the final answer is pi over four and that's it for this problem 

Transcript for: Shell Method - Volume of Revolution
in this video we're going to focus on finding the volume using the shell method so let's begin by drawing a picture now we're going to find the volume when rotated about the y-axis what i'd like to do is draw a rectangle the limits of integration is going to be from a to b the radius is the distance between the x-axis and the axis of rotation by the way you should always draw the rectangle parallel to the axis of rotation so in this case you want it to be parallel to the y axis and then this is going to be the height of the shell or the rectangle so using the shell method the equation is this the volume is going to be equal to 2 pi integration from a to b and then it's the radius which is going to be in terms of x times the height in terms of x so if you want to find the volume of the solid when rotated about the y axis the radius and the height have to be in terms of x now sometimes you may have two curves as opposed to one let's call the top curve f of x and the bottom g of x so we want to rotate it about the y axis so the rectangle is going to be parallel to the y axis now the radius is still the distance between the rectangle and the axis of rotation and this is going to be the height of the shell the only difference in this situation is that the height h of x is basically equal to the top function f of x minus the bottom function g of x everything else being the same the limits of integration will still be a to b they will represent x values now sometimes you may need to find a volume when rotated about the x-axis so let's use the same type of picture but we're going to rotate the region about the x-axis this time instead of the y-axis so now we're going to draw the rectangle parallel to the axis of rotation that is parallel to the x-axis the radius is the distance between the rectangle and the axis of rotation the height is parallel to the axis of rotation so this is the height of the rectangle so the volume is going to be pi well 2 pi not just pi and this time the limits of integration is c to d it's going to be y values so 2 pi integration from c to d of the radius in terms of y times the height in terms of y d1 so keep this in mind if you want to rotate the curve about the x-axis the radius and the height has to be in terms of x for this to work now let's see if we have two functions f and g let's say the function on the right is f and the one on the left is g we're going to rotate about the x axis so let's draw the rectangle parallel to the x axis this is going to be the radius still and here we have the height so the height is going to be equal to the function on the right which is f of x minus the function on the left g of x and that's it that's how you can find h so let's start with the first example let's say that we have the curve y is equal to the square root of x and a region is bounded by that curve the line y equals zero and x equals four and we're going to rotate it about the y axis so feel free to pause the video and try this problem so let's begin by drawing a picture so this is the square root of x and it's going to stop at x equals four so let's draw a rectangle and we're going to rotate this about the y axis so this is the radius and this is the height so notice that the radius is the same as x so thus we can say that r is equal to x x is the distance between the y axis and the rectangle notice that the height h is the same as y so we can say that h is equal to y now if we're rotating about the y axis or about any line parallel to the y axis the radius and the height has to be in terms of x now the radius is already in terms of x which is good we just got to convert y into something in terms of x now we know that y is equal to the square root of x so we can replace y with root x so now we have h in terms of x now let's use the formula so the volume is equal to 2 pi integration from a to b r of x times h of x dx a is zero b is four so we're going to integrate it from zero to four the radius is x the height is the square root of x x is basically x to the first power square root x is x to the one half whenever you multiply by common bases you need to add the exponents so one plus one half that's basically two over two plus one over two that's uh three over two so therefore we can rewrite the expression like this this is what we have so far so now let's integrate it the anti-derivative of x to the three half we need to add one to the exponent three over two plus one is five over two and instead of dividing by five over two let's multiply by two over five let's evaluate it from zero to four so first let's plug in four so we have four raised to the five over two multiplied by two over five and then minus two times zero raised to the five over two over five which that whole thing's gonna be zero now what is four raised to the five over two this is the same as four to the half raised to the fifth power whenever you raise one exponent to another you need to multiply the two exponents one half times five is five over two now four to the one half power is the same as the square root of four so that's two and two to the fifth power is 32 so we have two pi 2 times 32 over 5 minus 0 and 2 times 32 is 64 and 2 times 64 is 128. so the final answer is 128 pi divided by five and so uh that's the solution now let's work on another example let's say that y is equal to x minus x cubed and the region is bounded by that curve the line y equals zero and it's from x equals zero to x equal one and we're going to rotate this region about the y axis so try this example see if you can get the right answer using what you know already now what we can do is let's find the x-intercepts for this graph let's set y equal to zero if we factor out an x we're gonna have one minus x squared left over and we could factor one minus x squared using the difference of perfect squares method it's one plus x and one minus x the x-intercepts are zero negative one and one it turns out that if you graph this function and focus in only on the right side of the x i mean the right side of the y axis this graph is going to look something like this where this is zero and this is one and we're going to rotate it about the y axis and so let's draw a rectangle that's parallel to the y axis so this is going to be the radius and here we have the height so just like before the radius is the same as x and the height we can see is y so r equals x and h is equal to y but we need the radius and the height to be in terms of x so let's replace y with x minus x cubed so that's going to be the height so now we can write the integral the volume is going to be 2 pi integration from a to b or 0 to 1 and then the radius times the height dx so what we're going to do at this point is distribute x x times x is x squared x times x cube is x to the fourth so now let's integrate the function the antiderivative of x squared is x cubed over three and the antiderivative of x to the fourth is x to the fifth over five integrated from zero to one and let's not forget to multiply our answer by two pi now let's begin by plugging in one one to the third is just one so it's going to be one over three and one to the fifth is one so one over five and then if we plug in zero zero cube is zero zero to the fifth is zero so the whole thing is zero now we need to get common denominators so let's multiply one over three by five over five and then let's multiply one over five by three over three so this will give us a common denominator of fifteen so what we have now is five over fifteen minus three over fifteen five minus three is two so this is two over fifteen times 2 pi 2 times 2 pi is 4 pi so the final answer to this problem it's 4 pi over 15. 

Transcript for: Volumes Using Cross Sections - Calculus
in this video we are going to review how to find the volume of a solid using cross sections so there's two formulas that you need to be aware of the volume can be found using this equation is the integration from a to b of the area function and if it's in terms of x then the cross sections has to be perpendicular to the x-axis you can also use this equation where c and d are y values if it's in terms of y then the cross sections has to be perpendicular to the y axis so for this problem the cross sections are perpendicular to the x-axis so we're going to use this formula now let's go ahead and draw a graph so y is equal to the square root of x and it's bounded by the x axis and the line x equals four now if we draw a square the cross sections are squares the area of the square is basically side squared and s is perpendicular to the x-axis s represents the base of the cross section so notice that s is the same as y so the area which is s squared is also equal to y squared and y is the square root of x our goal is to get the area function in terms of x so a of x is equal to x so if we integrate it from a to b this will give us the volume so we're going to integrate it from zero to four and a of x is simply x the antiderivative of x is x squared divided by two evaluated from zero to four so first let's plug in four and then we will plug in zero four squared is 16 16 divided by two is eight so that is the answer now another way in which you can graph this particular problem is you can draw it like this if you want to see why we set it up the way we did so this is the graph y equals square root x and we said this that line is basically s it represents the base of the square and let's draw the square so there is a square you can draw that way too and so this is s as well and so you can see that the area is s squared and you can also see that y is equal to s so you can graph it that way it may help you to visualize it better number two find the volume of the solid bounded by the x-axis the y-axis and the line y equals four minus x over 2 using cross sections of semi-circles that are perpendicular to the x-axis so if the cross-sections are perpendicular to the x-axis ultimately we need to use this equation to find the volume so we got to find the area of the cross section in terms of x but now let's go ahead and graph the equation so we have a line which is four minus x over two we could rewrite it as negative one over two x plus four so now it's in a slope intercept form so the slope is negative one-half and the y-intercept is four so we could graph it at the point zero four and if the slope is negative it's a decreasing function now let's find the x-intercept to do that replace y with zero and solve so we can multiply both sides by two negative half times two is negative one so this is going to be negative x four times two is eight so if we add x to both sides we see that x is equal to eight so the x intercept is eight and the y intercept is four now the cross sections are perpendicular to the x axis so that means s is parallel to the y-axis so this is s now we can graph the function another way too let's say that's the x-axis this is the y-axis and the cross sections are perpendicular to the x-axis which means they're parallel it's the y-axis and they're basically a semi-circle so that's the graph and this is s so as you can see s represents the diameter of the semicircle now we know that the area of a semi-circle is one-half pi r squared and so the radius is half of s so s is equal to two r and one half of s is equal to r so let's replace r with s divided by two so the area is one half pi times one half s squared one half squared is basically one fourth if you do one over two times one over two you get one over four so this is one over four s squared so therefore the area is one half times one fourth is one eighth so it's one over eight pi s squared and if you look at the graph we can see that s is the same as y so s equals y so the area in terms of y is one over eight pi y squared now let's get rid of a few things let's make some space so at this point we can replace y with four minus x over two or let's just use let's use that so the area is going to be 1 over 8 pi times 4 minus 1 half x squared so now we have the area function in terms of x which means we can now use this equation to calculate the volume so the graph was bounded between 0 and 8. so a is 0 b is 8 and then we can integrate the area function at this point and let's not forget dx now before we find the integration of that function we need to foil four minus one half x square so that's four minus one half x times itself so four times four that's equal to sixteen and then we have four times one half x which is negative two x and negative half x times four is also negative two x and then negative one half x times negative one half x that's positive one fourth x squared so this becomes 1 4 x squared minus 4 x plus 16 if we combine the middle terms so therefore the volume is the integration from 0 to 8. over eight pi one fourth x squared minus four x plus sixteen d x so now let's take the constant and move it to the front so the volume is 1 8 pi integration from 0 to 8. one over four x squared minus four x plus sixteen in parentheses with a dx out in the front so now let's find the anti-derivative the anti-derivative of 1 4 x squared that's 1 4 x to the third divided by 3. the inside derivative of 4x is going to be 4x squared divided by 2 and for 16 it's going to turn into 16x evaluated from zero to eight and we still have one eighth pi in front so let's plug in eight so four times three is twelve so that's one over twelve times eight to the third power four divided by two is two and then we have eight squared plus sixteen times eight and then minus we plug in zero to everything it's all going to equal zero now what i'm going to do is multiply or i'm going to distribute the 1 over 8 to every term because they all have 8 inside so therefore this 8 will cancel 1 8 out of each term that we see there so that's going to simplify our calculations so then this becomes 1 over 12 and instead of 8 to the third is now 8 squared we have to take off an 8. and this is going to be two times eight plus sixteen and we're gonna have a pie in front now negative two times eight is sixteen plus sixteen those two will cancel so now we just have this term to deal with eight squared is 64. so we have 64 times the pi outside divided by 12. 64 pi over 12 we can reduce it if we divide both numbers by four this is going to be 16 pi divided by three and so that is the answer now if you want to get the decimal value for it if you type in 16 pi divided by 3 in your calculator you should get five 16.755 that's the decimal value so that's the volume of the solid 

Transcript for: Average Value of a Function Over an Interval - Calculus
so let's say if we have a linear function f of x is equal to two x plus one over the interval one to five how can we find the average value of the function over the interval one to five well a straw graph so we have a y-intercept of one and a slope of two and so we're focused on the interval one to five now according to the mean value theorem the area under the curve which is basically the area that's shaded that's equal to the area of the rectangle at some value c now the average value is f c that's what we're looking for that's the average value of the function and it occurs when the area of the rectangle is equal to the area under the curve so the area under the curve is the definite integral from a to b the area of the rectangle i need to redraw it's going to be the width of the rectangle times the height so the height is basically f c the width is b minus a so it's the height times the width now to get the average value we need to isolate f c so we need to divide both sides by b minus a so the average value is 1 over b minus a of the integral a to b f of x dx now if we were to plug in 1 into this equation f of 1 is going to be 2 times 1 plus 1 so that's going to be three and f of five which is here that's gonna be two times five plus one which is eleven if we average f of a and f b three plus eleven is fourteen divided by 2 that's 7. now do you think the average value will it be less than 7 equal to 7 or greater than 7 how will it compare to the average y value at these x values it turns out for a linear function the average value of the function will be the average y value in the interval a to b now if it's not linear it can vary but for a linear function we should expect 7 as our answer because that's the average y value from a to b now the average x value if you average 1 and 5 you're going to get 3. so for a linear function c is going to equal 3. and that's what we need to calculate we need to calculate f c the average y value and c the x value where the area under the curve equals the area of the rectangle so let's see if c is equal to 3 and f c is equal to seven so let's start with the formula so the average value is going to be one over b minus a times the definite integral from a to b f of x dx so we know that a is one b is five so this is going to be one over five minus one integral from one to five f of x is two x plus one and then times d x five minus one is four the anti-derivative of two x that's gonna be two x squared over two and for one it's x evaluated from one to five now we could cancel two if we plug in five five squared is 25 plus five and then minus if we plug in one it's going to be one squared plus one 25 plus 5 is 30 and 1 plus 1 is 2. if we factor out 1 4 it's going to be 30 minus 2 which is 28 and one-fourth of 28 is seven so notice that the average value is indeed equal to the average y value in the interval so the average value of the function is seven now let's set the average value of the function equal to f of c so the average y value is seven f of c is going to be two c plus one subtracting one from both sides seven minus 1 is 6 and if we divide by 2 c is 3. so for a linear function c is the average of a and b and the average value of the function for a linga function is the average of f of a and f b and i run out of space let's try another problem so what if we don't have a linear function let's say if we have x squared from zero to four let's see how the average value of the function will compare to f of a and f of b the average of those two numbers so let's calculate f of a plus f of b divided by two so that's going to be f of 0 plus f of 4 over 2. so when x is 0 y is 0 when x is 4 4 squared is 16 16 divided by 2 is 8. the average y value i'm going to write like this is eight and the average c value or rather the average x value in the interval that is if we average a and b we see the midpoint is two so now let's calculate c and f of c in this problem so it's going to be one over b minus a so a is zero b is four so this is going to be four minus zero and then we have the integral from a to b f of x dx so the antiderivative of x squared is x cubed over three evaluated from zero to four so if we plug in four it's going to be four to the third over three and then minus zero to the third over three four to the third divided by four is four squared and four squared is sixteen and sixteen over three as a decimal is five point thirty three or 5.3 repeating so in this example notice that the average value of the function is less than the average y value now let's calculate the c value that corresponds to that average value so the average value let's set it equal to f c so f of c is x squared and the average value we said was 16 over 3. so let's take the square root of both sides so this is going to be 4 over the square root of 3 and that's equal to x now granted we get 2 answers plus or minus but the negative answer is not going to be in this interval so we'll stick with the positive answer now you can rationalize it if you want so if you multiply the top and the bottom by the square root of 3 this is going to be 4 square root 3 over 3. and so the decimal value for that is 2.309 so in this case this is the c value as well i should have wrote this as c squared instead of x squared f c is equal to c squared notice that c is greater than the average x value on the interval a to b and so if you don't have a linear function c is not going to be the midpoint of a and b and the average value of the function is not going to be the average y value if it's not a linear function but if it is a linear function then the average function value will be the average y value let's try one more example so let's say f of x is equal to the square root of x on the interval 4 to 16. go ahead and find the average value of the function and find a value of c that corresponds to it so let's start with the equation the average value is going to be 1 over b minus a times the area under the curve so b is 16 a is 4 and f of x is the square root of x which is x raised to the one half 16 minus 4 is 12 and the antiderivative of x to the one half one half plus one is three over two and then we need to multiply by two over three and then evaluate it from four to sixteen so let's move the constants to the front two over twelve can be reduced to one over six and one over six times one third that's going to be one over eighteen so we have one over eighteen and then x to the three halves evaluated from four to sixteen so this is going to be 16 to the three halves minus four to the three halves now what is 16 raised to the three halves this is 16 to the half raised to the third power 16 to the one half is basically the square root of 16 which is four and four to the third is 64. now for this one apply the two first the square root of four is two and then raise it to the third power two to the third is eight so four raised to the one point five is eight and then 64 minus 8 is 56 so we have 56 over 18. and we could divide both numbers by 2. half of 56 is 28 half of 18 is nine so the answer the average value of the function is 28 over nine now let's calculate the c value that gives us that average value so the average value of the function and the interval of 4 to 16 is that number f of c is the square root of c so we need to square both sides 28 squared is 784 9 squared is 81 and so this is equal to c now the midpoint of 4 and 16 4 plus 16 is 20 20 over 2 is 10. so the average x value is 10 and c as a decimal 784 divided by 81 that's 9.679 so these numbers are close but in this example c is less than the average x value now let's calculate the average y value and compare it to the average value of the function so f of a that's f of 4 plus f of b divided by 2. f of 4 the square root of 4 is 2 the square root of 16 is 4. two plus four is six six divided by two is three now twenty eight over nine twenty seven over nine is three twenty eight over nine that's about three point one repeating so in this case the average value of the function is greater than the average y value in this problem now let's analyze the three examples that we have so let's draw three graphs so the first one was a linear function let me graph it in white that goes up like this the second one was x squared and it looks like that for the most part and then the square root of x was our last example so this was 2x plus 1 x squared and the square root of x now for the first one it was between one and five the midpoint of which is three for the second one it was between zero and four the average x value for that is 2 and for the last one it was from 4 to 16 with an average x value of 10. now let's focus on the x values in this example c was equal to three so c was equal to the average x value for the second example c was greater than 2 it was 2.309 and so c was greater than the average x value and for the third example c was less than the average x value it was 9.679 now let's focus on the y values when x is one y is three and when x is five y is eleven and the average of those two is seven now the average function value was seven as well so we could say the average value of the function is equal to the average y value for that example now for the second example when x is 0 y is 0 when x is 4 y is 16. so the average between 0 and 16 is 8. but the average function value was less than 8. in fact it was about 5.3 repeating so the average function value was less than the average y value for that problem now for the last one the square root of 4 is 2 and the square root of 16 is four keep in mind this is not drawn to scale so the average of these two numbers is three however the function value was 3.1 so for this particular value or for this particular graph rather the average function value was greater than the average y value and let's understand why so for a linear function the average function value will equal the average y value but if it's not linear it's going to vary from 0 to 4 if we draw the secant line notice that the curve for the function is below the secant line therefore the average value of the function will be less than the average y value this one it's on a secant line and that's why the average function value is the same as the average y value for the last example if we draw the secant line between 4 and 16 notice that the curve is above the secant line so the average function value is greater than the average y value you 

Transcript for: Mean Value Theorem For Integrals
in this video we're going to go over the mean value theorem for integrals and let's say if we have some function which looks like this from a to b now there's some point c where the area under this region is equal to the area of the rectangle so i'm going to draw the rectangle in blue so the area of that rectangle is equal to the area under the curve from a to b and so if the function is continuous on the closed interval a b and if c is in that interval then according to the mean value theorem the definite integral of f of x dx from a to b is equal to f of c times b minus a so the definite integral represents the area under the curve in red so that's the definite integral so it's the area of the curve and f of c times b minus a b minus a represents the width of the rectangle and f c that's a y value that represents basically the height of the rectangle with times height that gives us the area of the rectangle so according to the mean value theorem at some point c the area of the rectangle is equal to the area under the curve and f c represents the average value now let's say that f of x is equal to x squared over the interval zero to four find the value of c guaranteed by the mean value theorem for integrals in this function so let's start with the formula so the area under the curve is equal to the area of the rectangle so f of c times v minus a now a in this example is zero and b is four so this is going to be the integral from zero to four and f of x is x squared f of c well if f of x is x squared what is f of c so if you plug in c into that equation f of c is going to be c squared and then we have b minus a so that's going to be 4 minus 0 now on the left let's find the antiderivative of x squared so using the power rule it's gonna be x cubed over three evaluated from four to zero on the right we simply have four c squared now let's focus on the left side if we plug in 4 it's going to be 4 to the third over 3 and then if we plug in 0 that's just going to be 0. now 4 to the third is 64. and so we have this let's multiply both sides by 1 4. 64 divided by 4 is 16. so 16 over 3 is equal to c squared now let's take the square root of both sides the square root of 16 is 4. so we have 4 over square root 3 and that's equal to c but this is going to be plus or minus now let's rationalize that value the final answer is going to be plus or minus 4 square root 3 over 3. now to get a decimal value of that this is plus or minus 2.309 now c has to be in the interval a to b zero to four positive two point three zero nine is in that interval but not negative 2.309 so the c that we're looking for is positive 4 square root 3 over 3. and so this is the answer let's try another problem let's say that f of x is equal to the square root of x on the interval from one to nine go ahead and calculate the value of c for this problem so let's start with the formula in this example a is 1 b is nine so we have the definite integral from one to nine f of x is the square root of x and f of c all you gotta do is replace x with c so that's gonna be the square root of c and then b minus a nine minus one now let's replace the square root of x with x and one half because we need to rewrite it in order to integrate it so using the power rule one half plus one is three over two and instead of dividing it by three over two it's the same as multiplying it by two over three let's evaluate it from one to nine and then nine minus one is eight so on the left we have 2 times 9 raised to the 3 over 2 over 3 minus 2 times 1 raised to the 3 over 2 over 3 and that's equal to 8 square root c now what is 9 raised to the 3 over 2 how can we evaluate that fractional exponent so anytime you have rational exponents it's helpful if you split it this is the same as nine raised to the one half raised to the three when you raise one exponent to another you need to multiply a half times three is three halves so nine to the half is basically the same as the square root of nine which is three and three to the third is twenty seven so therefore we have two-thirds of 27 and then minus two-thirds of one we can factor out two-thirds and make it easier or we could just multiply 2 and 27 2 times 27 is 54 and then minus 2 or 3. 54 minus 2 is 52 and so right now this is what we have now what we need to do is divide both sides by eight or multiply both sides by one over eight so we could cancel these eights on the right we can break down 52 into 13 times 4 and 8 is 4 times 2 and let's not forget the 3. so we could cancel a 4. and so we have 13 over 6 is equal to the square root of c so now we need to take the square of both sides 13 squared is 169 6 squared is 36 and that's equal to c now we need to make sure that it's in the interval a to b in this problem one to nine so let's get the decimal value of 169 over 36 so as a decimal that's about 4.694 so that's definitely in this interval so this is the answer now let's say that f of x is a linear function and let's say it's two x plus three on the interval from 2 to 10. now if you had to guess the value of c what would you say now what is the midpoint of 2 and 10 to find the midpoint we can average to two values 2 plus 10 is 12 and 12 divided by 2 is 6. do you think c will be less than 6 equal to 6 or greater than 6. now for linear functions the c value will be equal to the midpoint value now let's confirm it so let's start with our original formula and then let's plug in what we have so a is 2 b is 10 f of x is 2x plus 3. and so f of c is going to be two c plus three and then b minus a that's ten minus two now the antiderivative of x is x squared over two and for three it's three x evaluate it from two to ten now two i mean ten minus two is eight so now let's focus on the right side we could cancel a 2 and so we have x squared plus 3x if we plug in 10 that's going to be 10 squared plus 3 times 10 and then minus we need to plug in 2 2 squared plus three times two so all of that is equal to two c plus three times eight ten squared is a hundred and three times ten is thirty two squared is four three times two is six a hundred plus thirty is one thirty and four plus six is ten and one thirty minus ten is one twenty so now let's divide both sides by eight so what's 120 over eight think of 120 as 80 plus 40 and 80 divided by 8 is ten forty divided by eight is five so 120 divided by eight is fifteen and that's equal to two c plus three now let's subtract both sides by 3. so 15 minus 3 is 12 and that's equal to 2c and so if we divide by 2 we can see that c in this example is 6 and 6 is the midpoint of a b which is 2 to 10. and so for a linear function the c value where the area of the rectangle is equal to the area under the curve is simply the midpoint of a b now let's compare the three problems that we had so the first one was x squared which looked like this the second one was the square root of x which looks like that on the right side of the graph this is just the the right half of x squared and this is the graph for the square root of x and for the third one two x plus three it looks like that so for x squared the interval was from zero to four and for the square root of x we went from one to nine and then four this was two x plus three we went from two to ten now the midpoint of zero and four is two and for one to nine it's five and for two that's ten it's six now the c value for this one was to the right of two it was two point three zero nine now for the second graph it was to the left of midpoint and c was 4.694 and for the last one c was equal to the midpoint it was equal to 6. so the c value guaranteed by the mean value theorem it's going to be equal to the midpoint if you have a linear function where it's neither concave up or concave down on the left we have an increase in function that's concave up and in that case c is going to be greater than the midpoint but for a function that's increasing and concave down c as we can see is less than the midpoint but if it's linear and it's neither concave up or down c is equal to the midpoint you 

Transcript for: Work Problems - Calculus
in this video we're going to talk about how to solve work related problems as it relates to calculus so let's start with the basics how much work is required to lift a five kilogram book two meters high above the ground so if you wish to calculate the work done by a constant force the work is equal to the force multiplied by the displacement and you need to know that force is mass times acceleration and the acceleration in the y direction is g which represents gravitational acceleration so for this problem replacing f with mg the work required to lift up something is mgd m is the mass in kilograms that's five kilograms g is the gravitational acceleration that's 9.8 meters per second squared and d is the distance in meters 5 times 2 is 10 and 10 times 9.8 is 98. so the answer for part a is 98 joules and that's it now for part b how much work is required to lift a 30 pound box four feet off the ground the units are different now when you see the weight in pounds this doesn't represent mass weight is a force so all we need to do is use this equation so the work done is going to be the force of 30 pounds multiplied by a distance of 4 feet so 30 times 4 is 120 so it's going to be 120 foot pounds which is another unit of work number two find the work done in pushing a car a distance of 15 meters with a constant force of 500 newtons so anytime you wish to find the work done by constant force you can use that equation so the force is 500 newtons and the distance is 15 meters so we could just multiply those two numbers and don't forget a newton times a meter is a joule so the work done is going to be 7500 joules and that's all you need to do for this problem number three a variable force in newton's acting on an object is represented by the function f of x is equal to x squared minus four x plus seven where x is the distance in meters from the origin how much work is required to move the object from x equal one to x equal four the work done by a variable force is the definite integral from a to b of the force function times dx so in this case a is one b is four based on the values that we see here f of x is x squared minus four x plus seven the antiderivative of x squared is x cubed divided by three and the antiderivative of x is x squared over two and the antiderivative of seven is seven x so let's evaluate it from one to four so if we plug in four it's going to be four to the third over three and then four divided by two is two and then times four squared plus seven times four and then we need to plug in one so it's going to be one over three and then two x squared so two times one squared plus seven times one now four to the third is 64 and four squared is sixteen seven times four is twenty eight and on the right we have one third minus two plus seven so this is sixty four over 3 2 times 16 is 32 and if we distribute the negative sign it's going to be negative 1 3 plus 2 minus 7. so now let's combine like terms so we can combine these two 64 minus one is 63 so that's 63 divided by three negative 32 plus 28 is negative 4 and 2 minus 7 is negative 5. now 63 divided by 3 that's 21 and negative 4 minus 5 is 9. 21 minus 9 is 12. so the answer is 12 joules number four a force of 50 pounds is required to hold a spring stretch 5 inches beyond its natural life how much work is required to stretch it from its natural life to 10 inches beyond its natural life and foot pounds so let's talk about springs so let's say this is a spring that it's in its natural state in order to stretch a spring you need to exert a force and in order to hold it at this position you have to apply a certain force the spring wants to snap back and so there's a restoring force that wishes to pull it back so to calculate the force that's required to hold it at the new position that force is equal to the spring constant times x where x is the distance between its natural length and its current lift now k is a constant and k can be found by taking the force divided by x so in this problem we need to find k 50 pounds of force is required to stretch the spring five inches beyond its natural left so x is 5 and 50 divided by 5 is 10 so k is 10 pounds per inch so now that we have k we can write the force as a function of x so it's going to be k times x or 10x so that's the force required to stretch the spring at any distance x from its natural life so if we want to stretch it let's say 20 inches from its natural length the force would be 10 times 20 or 200 pounds so now we can calculate the work the work done is going to be the definite integral of f of x dx so we wish to calculate the work required to stretch it from its natural length that's when x is 0 to 10 inches beyond its natural length which x is 10 x is the distance from the natural length to its current position so the work is going to be the integral from 0 to 10 f of x which is 10x times dx the antiderivative of 10x is going to be 10x squared over 2. and so ten divided by two is five so it's going to be five x squared evaluated from zero to ten and that's five times ten squared minus five times zero ten squared is a hundred and so it's five times a hundred which is five hundred and the units are pounds times inches now we wanted to convert it to pounds times feet so one foot is equal to 12 inches so the unit inches will cancel and so this becomes 500 divided by 12 foot pounds now we can reduce 512 so 500 we can write that as 125 times 4 and 12 we can write that as 3 times 4 and so we could cancel a 4. and so the final answer is going to be 125 over 3 pounds times feet and this is it number five a force of 60 newtons is required to hold a spring that has been stretched from its natural length of 12 centimeters to 17 centimeters how much work is done in stretching the spring from 15 centimeters to 20 centimeters so the first thing we need to do is calculate k so we know that the force required to hold a spring beyond its natural length is k times x where x is the distance between where you're holding the spring and its natural life so let's say this is the natural length of the spring that's 12 centimeters and we stretched it beyond its natural length so this distance here that's x 17 is the total distance between point a and point b x is the difference between 17 and 12. so in this example x is 5 centimeters when a force of 60 newtons is applied so 60 equals k times 5 so k is going to be 60 divided by 5 which is 12 and it's newtons per centimeter now let's get k in newtons per meter so let's convert five centimeters to meters one meter is a hundred centimeters so five divided by a hundred is point zero five meters now k is f divided by x so we have 60 newtons divided by .05 meters and so that's going to be 1200 newtons per meter so that's the force in terms of x as a function it's k times x or 1200x so the work required is going to be the definite integral from a to b but we're comparing these values to its natural length of 12. so the difference between 12 and 15 is 3 centimeters but in meters that's 3 divided by 100 so it's 0.03 and the difference between 20 and the natural life of 12 is 8 centimeters or 0.08 meters and then it's going to be f of x dx so the anti-derivative of x is x squared over two evaluated from point zero three to point zero eight and twelve hundred divided by two is six hundred so we have six hundred x squared so now let's plug in point zero eight so it's 600 times .08 squared minus 600 times .03 squared 0.08 squared times 600 that's 3.84 and .03 squared times 600 is 0.54 and so the final answer is 3.3 joules and so that's the work required to stretch the spring from 15 centimeters to 20 centimeters number six an 80 foot long rope with a weight of three pounds per foot hangs over the edge of a building that is 200 feet high how much work is required to pull the entire rope to the top of the building so let's draw a picture so let's say this is the building and here we have a rope that hangs on the building now let's say this is 0 and this is 80. let's make this the origin so we want to lift that entire rope to the top of the building how much work is required well we know that work is equal to force times distance and force is basically weight weight is a force and you can describe the weight as being the weight density of the rope which is pounds per feet times the left of the rope which is in feet if you see it that way notice that the unit's feet cancel and it gives you the weight in pounds which is a force now this expression is similar to f is equal to kx x can be measured in feet k for the spring constant can be measured in pounds per fee because k is f divided by x where if f is in pounds and x is in feet k is pounds per feet so the generic force equation is going to be the weight density of the rope in pounds per feet times the length of the rope or the distance that the rope travels which is x so in this case it's three pounds per feet times x so that's the function that tells us the force that's required to lift up the rope in terms of x now to calculate the work required it's going to be the definite integral from a to b f of x dx now we need to determine what a is and what's b a is going to be 0 b is 80. so it's going to be from 0 to 80. f of x is 3x and then dx so the antiderivative of 3x is 3x squared over 2 evaluated from 0 to 80. so that's going to be 3 over 2 times 80 squared minus 3 over 2 times 0 squared now 80 times 80 that's 6400 if we multiply that by 3 over 2 this will give us 9 600 and the units is going to be pounds times fee for this problem now let's try another example part b how much work is required to pull half of the rope to the top of the building so let's draw a new picture so let's say this is the building and let's say this is the rope now it's best to break it up into two parts so the rope is 80 feet long and we need to move it up by some distance x now you want to calculate the work that's required to lift the upper half and the bottom half separately so let's calculate the work that's required to lift the top portion of the rope now this entire part is moving to the top of the building so the entire first half for the rope is going to be lifted to the top so we can calculate that answer using the same technique as part a and so it's going to be the integration from 0 to 40 3x dx because that part is going to be lifted up by x so it's going to be 3x squared over two evaluated from zero to forty so that's three over two times forty squared minus zero squared 40 squared is 1600 times three over two so that's going to be 2400 pounds times feet now to calculate the work that's required to lift the bottom half you need to realize that the bottom half doesn't move by a variable distance x all of it moves exactly by 40 feet because this part is not going to go over the top of the building it's still going to be hanging along the side of the building so that entire segment moves up by a distance of 40 feet because that's half the length of the rope so everything is going to be the same but the distance here won't be x it's going to be 40. now we're going to integrate it from 40 to 80 but it's going to be 3 instead of x so it's not going to be 3x but 3 times 40 dx so which is 120. the antiderivative of 120 is 120x evaluated from 40 to 80. so to 120 times 80 minus 40. eighty minus forty is forty and forty times one twenty is forty eight hundred so if you add up these two values twenty four hundred plus forty eight hundred that's going to be seventy two hundred with the units pounds times feet and this is the final answer another quick way to get this answer is it's always going to be three-fourths of the answer in part a so in part a it was 9 600 pounds times feet to lift up the entire rope to the building now if you want to lift up just the first half to the top of the building it's going to require three fourths of the work required to lift up the entire rope it takes more work to lift up the first half than the second half because as you lift up the first half you're pulling up the entire rope when you're lifting up the second half it's just the bottom portion which is a lot easier to do so when you begin to lift up the rope it's hard to lift up at the beginning but towards the end it gets easier because there's less of it that's hanging down so anytime you wish to calculate the work that's required to pull half of the rope to the top of the building it's going to be 75 percent of the work required to pull the entire rope to the top of the building 9 600 times 0.75 is 7 200. number seven how much work is required to lift a 300 pound crate up a distance of 200 feet using a rope that weighs four pounds per foot so there's two parts the first part is we need to lift up the crate so how much work is required to lift up a box or a crate the work required is simply force times distance and so the force is the weight of the crate which is 300 pounds and we're lifting it up by a distance of 200 feet so it's going to be 300 times 200 and that is 60 000 pounds times fee so that's the work required just to lift the crate now we need to calculate the work required to lift up the rope by a distance of 200 feet so first we need to write an equation for the force that's required to lift up the rope in terms of x and it's going to be the weight density in pounds per feet times the distance that we're lifting it up so the force equation it's going to be 4 pounds per feet times x or simply 4x so the work required is going to be the definite integral from a to b so from 0 to 200 we're going to integrate 4x dx so the anti-derivative of 4x is 4x squared over two evaluated from zero to two hundred so four divided by two is two so we have two x squared and so that's going to be two times two hundred squared minus 0 squared 200 squared is 40 000. if we multiply that by 2 that's going to give us 80 000 pounds times feet so the total work required to lift up the crate along with the rope is going to be the sum of these two numbers and so sixty thousand plus eighty thousand is a hundred and forty thousand let's see if i can fit that here so it's gonna be 140 000 pounds times feet so that's the total work required to lift up the crate and the rope you just need to calculate the work required for each item separately and then just add it up let's work on this last problem an inverted circular cone with a height of 12 meters and a radius of 5 meters is filled with water to a height of 9 meters how much work is required to empty the tank by pumping all of the water to the top of the tank well let's draw the inverted circular cone and then this is going to be the water level now the cone it has a radius of 5 meters and the height of 12 meters the height of the water is 9 meters and so this distance here between the top of the cone and the top of the water level that stream that's 12-9 how can we determine the work required to pump all of the water to the top of the tank the generic formula that you could use is this equation the work required is going to be the density of order times the gravitational acceleration times the definite integral from a to b of the volume of a cross section as a function of x times the displacement and then dx so if we draw a cross section which is going to be the shape of a cylinder with a height of delta x we need to write an expression that tells us the volume of that cross-sectional cylinder now if you're wondering how to get this equation or at least the foundation of it here's what you could do we'll get back to this cross section we know that work is equal to force times distance and force is mass times acceleration the acceleration in the y direction due to gravity is g gravitational acceleration so you can replace f with mg and d is basically the displacement now density which is indicated in physics by the row symbol is mass over volume so mass is density times volume so the work is going to be density times volume times gravitational acceleration times displacement and so it's going to be density times gravitational acceleration times the integral of the volume as the function of x times the displacement as a function of x dx from a to b but that's where this equation comes from if you wanted to know that now this cross-sectional cylinder has a radius r and the height we said is delta x the volume of the cylinder is pi r squared times the height now the height is delta x we need to write a relationship between r and x and we're going to use similar triangles to do that so we have this triangle and this part of the triangle what is the height of that part of the triangle well first this cross sectional area we're going to say it's x units deep therefore this portion has to be 12 minus x so this is going to be 12 minus x and the entire height of the triangle the large triangle that's going to be 12. this part is 5 and this portion here is r so for the small triangle we can say the ratio is r over 12 minus x and for the large triangle it's has a ratio of five to twelve if we look at the radius to the height so if we multiply both sides of this equation by 12 minus x we can see that r is going to be 5 over 12 times 12 minus x so the volume as a function of x is going to be pi times the radius squared that's 5 over 12 12 minus x squared and the height is delta x now in dental of integrals we're going to replace delta x with dx 5 squared is 25 12 squared is 144. so the volume is going to be 25 pi over 144 times 12 minus x squared dx now what about the displacement so this cross section this little piece we're going to pump it out to the top of the tank so we're going to lift it up by a distance x so the displacement function for this problem is simply x now let's plug in everything to our definite integral so the density of water in kilograms per cubic meter is a thousand g is 9.8 then we have the integral from a to b where those values represent the depth of water so the depth of water ranges from 3 to 12. the top part of the water is three meters below the top of the tank and the bottom part is 12 meters below the top of the tank so we're going to integrate it from 3 to 12. now at this point i don't need this picture anymore because it's taking up space so let me just rewrite this expression on the left side so it's going to be a thousand times 9.8 times the integral from 3 to 12 and the volume function is what we have here that's 25 pi over 144 times 12 minus x squared and the displacement we said is simply x for this problem so we're going to add x here now if you type this expression into your calculator you should get this as your final answer 6.82 times 10 to the sixth joules and that's it hopefully you have one of those graphing calculators that has the ability to evaluate definite integrals if you need to uh do it by hand you need to foil this expression and then distribute x you can move this constant to the front and then integrate the polynomial from 3 to 12. and then you should also get this answer as well if you do it correctly and avoid making mistakes so that's it for this video thanks for watching you 

Transcript for: Applications of Integration Formula Review - Antiderivatives, Definite Integrals, FTC, Area, Disk Me
in today's lesson I'm going to go over applications of integration it's basically going to be a review of the formulas associated with this topic so first let's talk about anti-derivatives the derivative of capital F is the same as lowercase f the anti-derivative of lowercase f is going to be capital f so this symbol it represents the integral sign so this is the indefinite integral of F ofx and that's going to give us the anti-derivative of lowercase f which is capital F and of course we need to add the constant of integration C now let's talk about rect to linear motion we know that the velocity function is the derivative of the position function the instantaneous acceleration function is the derivative of the Velocity function likewise the integral or the anti-derivative of the Velocity function is going to give you the position function and the anti-derivative or the indefinite integral of the acceleration function will give you the velocity function by the way you could find all of these formulas in the formula sheet that I'm going to post in the links below so now that we talked about indefinite integrals let's talk about definite integrals so this right here is an indefinite integral because you don't have the limits of integration but once you include the limits of integration the lower limit and the upper limit you now have a definite integral the result of a definite integral is a number a value a constant whereas the result of an indefinite integral is a function whether in terms of X or in terms of t or something so this might give you a value like 26 or -34 but this will give you a function so this is a definite integral and this is an indefinite integral but how can we evaluate indefinite integrals I mean I take that back how can we evaluate a definite integral we know that the indefinite integral of f ofx will give us capital F but to evaluate it once you get capital f F you need to plug in the upper limit and the lower limit of integration so this is going to be F of B minus F of a so that's how you can evaluate definite integrals first you need to find the anti-derivative and then you need to plug in the upper limit of integration and then the lower limit of integration top minus Bottom now let's talk about properties of definite integral the definite integral of a to B of f ofx DX this is equal to negative B to a f ofx DX so by switching A and B the sign will change the definite integral from a to a this is going to equal Z because F of a minus F of a they will cancel the definite integral of a constant where you don't have a variable like X or t just a number it's going to be that constant times the difference of the limits of integration so for example let's say we have the definite integral from 2 to 5 of8 DX this is going to be8 * 5 - 2 so8 * 3 that's -4 now definite integrals are additive so if we have the definite integral from A to B of f ofx DX and then plus the definite integral from B to C of f ofx DX this is going to equal the definite integral from a to c f ofx DX and if you want to understand why that's the case the first one this is going to be F of B minus F of a the second one this is going to be plus F of C minus F of B notice that F of B they cancel that one is positive this one is negative and we get the remaining result F of C minus F of a which is what we have on the right side now let's talk about how we can calculate the area under a curve the most simplest way to do this is to evaluate the definite integral of the function now sometimes you may not have a function or other times we have a function that's difficult to integrate in either case you could use a limit process to get the area under the curve so the value of the definite integral is also equal to the Limit as n approaches Infinity of the sum from I = 1 all the way to n of the function f of x sub I * Delta X so using a limit process here's what we're doing imagine we have some function F ofx and we want to determine the area on the Clos interval A to B so a is where we start B is where we end now one way in which we can approximate the area is by breaking it up into rectangles and we can calculate the area of each rectangle using something called REM and sums it could be the left end points using the right end points or even the midpoint rule Delta X is the width of each rectangle and F ofx sub I is the height of the rectangle so we have height times width that will give us the area of each rectangle and once we take the sum of all of them that will help us to calculate the area under the curve now n is the number of rectangles so for the example that I have we have a total of five rectangles so n would be five as n becomes larger and larger the approximation gets closer and closer to the exact answer so when n becomes Infinity we're going to get an exact answer of the area but when N is a small number like four or five it's an approximation but if you were to use 10 rectangles your approximation will be better if you use 20 rectangles even better so that's why we have a limit process here now Delta X is the width of each rectangle and to calculate the width it's the difference between a and b divided by the number of rectangles now in order to use this limit process by the way for those of you who want to see examples on it I'm going to post some links in the description section below where you can see how to use the limit process to calculate the area now in order to use the limit process you need to be familiar with certain summation formulas that'll make the process a lot easier to calculate here's the first one so the sum from I = 1 to n of the constant C is just C * n now if you just have I it's going to be n * n + 1 / 2 for I 2 it's going to be n * n + 1 * 2 n + 1/ 6 for I to the 3 power it's n n + 1 / 2^ 2 and you could find all of these formulas in the formula sheet that I'm going to post in the description section now for I to 4th it's going to be 6 n to the 5th + 15 n 4 + 10 n Cub - n all divided by 30 and there's another one I to 4 and I to 5th not very common but it could happen where you may need to use it for I to 5th it's 2 N 6+ 6 n 5th power + 5 n 4th power - n^ 2 over 12 so for those of you who want an example of how to use this let's say we want to find the sum of i^2 from I = 1 to 5 so this is going to be 1 2 + 2 2 + 3 2 + 4 2 + 5 2 now if this were to go up to 100 it will take a long time to calculate it but going up to five we can do this mentally so this is 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 so 1 + 9 that's going to be 10 and then 4 + 16 that is 20 and 10 + 20 is 30 30 + 25 will give us 55 now we could use the formula for i^2 it's n * n + 1 * 2 n + 1 / 6 so n is 5 so that's 5 5 + 1 is 6 2 n + 1 2 * 5 is 10 + 1 that's 11 over 6 6 will cancel and we get 5 * 11 which is 55 so as you can see these formulas are really use for for taking a sum of squared or Cub terms now let's talk about some other ways in which we can approximate the area under the curve so dealing with the topic of REM and sums if you want to calculate the area using the left end points so first let me draw a number line so let's say we want to find the area from A to B and we want to break it up into let's say four sub intervals so n is four this will be X Sub 0 x sub 1 x sub 2 x sub3 xub 4 now sometimes n could be larger so let's also call this X subn and let's call this x sub n minus1 the second before the last one so the area used in the left end points so this Five Points here but we're only going to use four because n is four so with the left end points it will be 0 1 2 and 3 so a generic equation for the area using the left end points will be Delta X that's the width of each rectangle and then we're going to add the heights of each rectangle so the first one starting from the left F of x0 plus F of X1 plus F of X2 and we're going to stop at in this case it will be F of x3 but in the general case it will be f ofx n minus one so using the left end points we start from the left we use all the end points except the last one Now using the right end points you could look at it the other way as we're starting from the right we're going to use everything except the one on the left or in other words you start from the second one you go all the way to the end so starting from the second point it's F of X1 plus F of X2 plus F of X3 F of x3 is the same as f of x n minus one well first I need to put dot dot dot to write a general equation actually it's better to write it this way F of x3 and then the last one will be F of xn so we're starting with the second point and we're going to stop at the last point now using the midpoint rule we want to get the points in the middle so5 1.5 2.5 3.5 so this is going to be F ofx .5 and then plus F ofx of 1.5 and then F ofx 2.5 and we're going to continue the pattern all the way to the last point minus5 so here's the last point x of n if you subtract that by 0.5 you'll get this point which for this example will be 3.5 so that's how you can approximate the area under the curve or even the value of a definite integral using reman sums with the left end point the right end point and the midpoint and keep in mind Delta X just like before it's B minus a/ n now there are some other forms of approximate integration that you may want to be familiar with this includes the trapeo rule and Simpson's rule so let's start with the trapeo rule T subn by the way the area which is the definite integral can be approximated using T subn just as it can be approximated with a sub L A subr and A subn but for the trapez zorder rule it's going to be Delta x / 2 * FX 0 + 2 * FX1 plus 2 * f ofx 2 and then this will continue and then you have the second to last one f ofx - 1 it's 2 * the value of that plus F ofx subn so notice that the first and the last one has a coefficient of one every other term in the middle has a coefficient of two very similar to the shape of a trapezoid the first and the last point they're at the bottom let's assign that a value of one every other point in the middle is has a value of two for the coefficient so that's the formula for the trapeo rule to estimate the area under a curve now let's talk about The Simpsons rule s subn is equal to Delta X over 3 * F ofx 0 + 4 * F of X1 + 2 * f ofx 2 and then 4 * F of x3 and the pattern is going to alternate between 2 and four for the middle terms now the third to last term is going to be 2 f ofx n minus 2 and the second to last term is going to be 4 F ofx -1 and the last term will have no coefficient in front of it so just like the trapez order rule the first and last term has a coefficient of one and then all the terms in the middle will alternate between four and two so the second and the second to last term will have a value of four but the ones in the middle will alternate between two and four with the trapeo rule all the middle ones have a coefficient of two and just like before Delta X is B minus a n so that's another way in which you can approximate the area under a curve and also the definite integral is by using The Simpsons Rule now let's move on to the fundamental theorem of calculus in short FTC part one now let's say we have some function G ofx and let's define it to be the integral from a tox of the function f of T DT in that case G Prime is going to be equal to the value of F ofx and here's why once we integrate lowercase f we'll get capital F evaluated from the top integran minus the bottom one now if we differentiate G of X so we can get G Prime of X we need to take the derivative of the results on the right the derivative of capital F is lowercase f and the derivative of a constant is zero so we can see that g Prime of X will equal F ofx so we could say that the derivative of this expression of the integral of a tox F of T DT that's going to simplify to F ofx which we shown here and that's the basic idea behind the fundamental theorem of calculus part one part two you're already familiar with it it's basically evaluating definite integrals so the integral of a to B of f ofx DX is equal to F of B capital F of B minus F of a that's part two of the fundamental theorem of calculus now the next topic is something called the net change theorem it looks very similar to part two of FTC the fundamental term of calculus the integral of the derivative of capital F is going to be F of B minus F of a that's the net change theem the difference between FTC part two is this would be just lowercase f as opposed to derivative of capital F so the basic idea is if you have some derivative function or some function that describes the rate of something and you want to find the accumulation you could use the net change strum to determine you know how much isum accumulated so let's say if you have a function that describes the rate of water flow into a tank and you want to calculate the accumulation of water um from time a to time B you could use the net change term if you have a function that describes the rate of water flow going into the tank same thing with velocity if you have velocity or how fast something is moving using the net change term you can determine the displacement of that moving object over time now let's move on I don't want to make this video too long let's talk about how we can calculate the area between two curves so we talked about how to calculate the area underneath one curve but between two curves we're going to have two functions the top function let's call it f ofx the bottom function G of X and we want to find the area between these two curves from A to B so the area of the Shaded region the area is going to be the definite integral from A to B of the top function which is f ofx minus the bottom function G ofx now sometimes you may need to calculate the area in terms of Y as opposed to in terms of X so let's say we have two functions the one on the right is f of Y the one on the left is G of Y and we want to integrate it from C to D along the Y AIS so we wanted to determine the area of this shaded region in this case the area is going to be the definite integral from C to D of the function on the right which is f of Y minus the function on the left in this case that's G of Y Dy so that's how you could determine the area between curves now sometimes you need to determine the volume of the shape generated when it's rotated about an axis so this is going to be the dis method there's also the washer method the shell method and volume by cross-sections but let's start with the dis method so let's say we have a function that looks like this and we want to rotate it along about the xais and we want to calculate the volume of the shape generated from A to B so using the dis method formula it's going to be Pi time the integral from A to B of the radius function squared so the radius is going to be the difference between the curve and the axis of rotation now this can be done in terms of X and in terms of of Y so let's say we have a function that looks like this but this time we want to rotate it about the Y AIS instead of the x axis and we want to find the volume from C to D using the dis method it's going to be Pi integral from C to D the radius squared but it's going to be in terms of Y instead of X so r y is going to be the distance between the axis of rotation and the curve now I don't want to make this video too long so for those of you who want the formulas for the washer method the shell method and volume by cross-sections in addition to other formulas that I didn't uh cover in this video like the work done by a force the mean value themm for integrals average value of a function Arc Length surface area you can find all those the formulas in the formula shape you know down below this video also I'm going to be posting other videos as well that will give you example problems on how to calculate the volume by the disc method how to calculate the area between curves how to use the shell method and the washer method so I'm going to put a lot of resources in the links down below for those of you who want more practice problems to prepare for your exam coming up so that's it for this video thanks again for watching and feel free to check out those other videos 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Final Exam Review
now this video is for those of you who are taking the calculus one final exam that is if you're in college or if you're in high school you can also use this if you're taking the ap calculus exam you could benefit from this video as well so this video is going to cover continuity limits derivatives integration and all the subtopics in those chapters so let's go ahead and begin number one evaluate the limit shown below now it's always good to see if you could use direct substitution however if we plug in 3 we're going to get 9 squared minus 9 which will give us 0 in the denominator so we can't use direct substitution in this case what we need to do first is we need to factor the expression so to factor a difference of perfect squares x squared minus 9 we can write that as x plus three times x minus three the square root of x squared is x and the square root of nine is three and so that's how you can get those numbers now what about factoring this trinomial what two numbers multiply to negative 15 but add to positive two so this is going to be positive five and negative three five plus negative 3 adds up to 2 5 times negative 3 multiplies to negative 15. so at this point we could cancel the x minus 3 factor and so what we have left over is the limit as x approaches 3 of x plus 5 over x plus 3. so now at this point we could use direct substitution so it's going to be 3 plus 5 divided by three plus three three plus five is eight three plus three is six and then if you divide both numbers by two you can reduce that to four over three so a is the correct answer now let's move on to number two evaluate the expression shown below so for each of these problems pause the video and uh work on it and then when you're ready just hit the play button and see if you have the right answer now for this problem you need to be familiar with the power rule the derivative of a variable raised to a constant such as x to the n it's going to be that constant times the variable raised to the constant minus one so just to review the derivative of x to the fourth power is going to be in this case n is four four x to the four minus one which is four 4x cubed so now let's try this problem so what we're going to do is differentiate each one individually the derivative of x to the sixth power is going to be six x to the sixth minus one which is five now for three over x we need to rewrite it if we move the variable to the top it becomes three x to the minus one and so now we can use the power rule so the derivative of x to the minus one is going to be negative one x to the negative one minus one which is negative two now the square root of x we also need to rewrite it and we can rewrite it as x to the one half so using the power rule it's going to be one half x and then it's gonna be one half minus one so far we have six x to the fifth power minus three x to the minus two and then one half minus one negative one is the same as negative two over two so one minus two is negative one so one half minus one is negative a half now we need to get rid of the negative exponents and so what we can do is bring the variable back to the bottom and the negative exponent is going to change to a positive exponent so this is going to be negative 3 over x squared and this is going to be plus 1. the 2 is already on the bottom now we need to move the x variable to the bottom and so that's going to be x to the positive one-half now x to the one-half is the same as the square root of x so instead of writing x and one-half we can write the square root of x here thus this is the final answer number three find the value of c that makes f of x continuous to make the piecewise function continuous the two parts of the piecewise function must be equal to each other when x is equal to three so step one set these two parts equal to each other so we're going to have two cx minus six is equal to x squared plus c x now the next thing we need to do is replace x with three so it's going to be two c times 3 minus 6 is equal to 3 squared plus c times 3. at this point we only have one variable in the equation which is c so we can solve for it 2 times 3 is 6. so on the left side we have six c minus six three squared is nine so we have nine plus three c on the right side now let's subtract both sides by three c and at the same time let's add six to both sides so we could cancel this and that so here we have 6c minus 3c which is 3c and then a 9 plus 6 that's 15. dividing both sides by three i don't know what just happened there but let's fix that we get 15 over three which is five and so that's the answer c is equal to five so that's the value of c that makes f of x continuous so e is the correct answer choice number four find the derivative of the expression shown below now there's three things that you need to know in order to do this problem you need to know how to differentiate exponential functions logarithmic functions and you need to know how to use the product rule so let's talk about how to find the derivative of exponential functions the derivative of e to the u where u is a function of x is going to be the same thing e to the u times u prime so let's say if i wanted to differentiate e to the x squared it's going to be e to the x squared times the derivative of x squared which is 2x or let's say if i want to differentiate e to the 7x it's going to be e to the 7x times the derivative of 7x which is 7. now let's talk about how to differentiate logarithmic functions specifically natural log functions the derivative of ln u with respect to x is going to be u prime divided by u so let's say if i want to differentiate ln x so u is x the derivative of x is 1 and since u is x that's going to be x on the bottom so we get 1 over x now let's see if i have the derivative of ln x squared plus 7. the derivative of x squared plus 7 is 2x on the bottom whatever is inside the natural log expression we just need to rewrite that on the bottom so it's going to be 2x over x squared plus 7. now let's talk about the product rule the derivative of let's say we have two things multiplied to each other f times g it's going to be the derivative of the first part so that's f prime times the second part which is g plus the first part times the derivative of the second so let's say that f is e to the 4x so what's f prime going to be using the equation that we had before it's e to the u times u prime so it's going to be e to the 4x times the derivative of 4x which is 4. now g is going to be the second part of that expression so that's ln 2x plus 5. now g prime using the formula u prime over u it's going to be the derivative of 2x plus 5 which is just 2 divided by whatever is inside the natural log expression so that's 2x plus 5. so now all we need to do is follow this formula so the derivative of this expression is going to be f prime which is 4 e to the 4x and then times g so that's ln 2x plus 5 and then plus f which is e to the 4x times g prime which is that two over two x plus five now we can basically combine those two so i'm gonna rewrite this as two e to the four x over two x plus five so we can leave our final answer like this and so that's it for this problem number five evaluate the following integral now i do want to mention a few things before we start this problem one is to check the links in the description section below i'm going to post a few links to some other videos like on limits derivatives and integration for those of you who need more example problems i'm also going to place a link to my calculus playlist let's say if you need help with a specific topic and you don't see it in this exam so feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance now these problems may seem simple to you but they will get harder as we progress in this video but let's start with this one so how can we evaluate the following integral what is the anti-derivative of 4x to the fifth plus x to the fourth minus 3x cubed i mean minus 3x squared divided by x squared what we need to do is simplify the expression first so let's begin by dividing each term in the numerator of the fraction by x squared so x to the fifth divided by x squared is going to be x cubed times four because five minus two is three now x to the fourth divided by x squared is x squared four minus two is two and then negative three x squared divided by x squared the x squared stuff will cancel and so it's going to be negative three now we have to use the power rule version for integration so just to review we said that the derivative of a variable raised to a constant is going to be the constant times the variable raised to the constant minus one the antiderivative of x to the n is going to be so instead of subtracting one we're going to add one to the constant and then we're going to divide by that result and don't forget to add the constant of integration so this is the power rule when dealing with uh integration add one and then divide by that result so what is the anti-derivative of x cubed the constant in the front just rewrite it so what we're going to do to find the anti-derivative of x cubed is add 1 to the exponent 3 plus 1 is 4 and then divide by that number here we're going to do the same 2 plus 1 is 3 and then divide by three now the antiderivative of negative three is simply negative three x negative three is the same as just negative three times x to the zero because anything raised to the zero power is one and so you could think of it this way if we add one to zero and then divide by the result we're going to get negative three x so that's the anti-derivative of negative 3. now the next thing we need to do is add the constant of integration finally we need to simplify our answer so we could cancel the four and so we're gonna have x to the fourth plus we can write this as one third x cubed and then minus 3x plus c so this is the final answer for the problem so that's how we can evaluate this particular integral number six find the equation of the tangent line to the curve x cubed plus 4 x y squared plus y cubed equals 107 at the point 2 comma 3 using implicit differentiation so now let's talk about this let's say if we have some generic curve it may not be this exact curve the tangent line is a line that touches the curve at exactly one point a secant line touches the curve at two points now in order to find the equation of the tangent line we'll need three things we need the x and y coordinates of this point of intersection which we have already and we need the slope of the tangent line which we do not have now the slope of the tangent line is equal to the first derivative of the function at some x value but in this particular problem it's going to equal d y d x at the point two comma three so we need to use implicit differentiation to find d y dydx plug in this point that will give us the slope of the tangent line and then we could use the point slope formula to write the equation of the tangent line so let's go ahead and begin let's start by differentiating this expression with respect to x the derivative of x cubed with respect to x is 3x squared now for this expression 4x y squared we need to use the product rule so let's say f is 4x and g is y squared now the basic idea behind the product rule is that you differentiate the first part of the function the derivative of 4x is 4 and then you leave the second part alone so that's going to be y squared and then plus now we're going to leave the first part alone and then differentiate the second part the derivative of y squared with respect to x be careful with this it's 2y times dydx so remember when dealing with implicit differentiation every time you differentiate a y variable with respect to x you need to add dydx to it derivative of y cubed is three y squared times d y d x and the derivative of a constant 107 is zero now at this point we do not need to isolate dydx in fact to make it easier i recommend replacing x and y with their respective values so let's replace x with two and let's replace y with three and then let's calculate the value of d y d x two squared is four times three that's twelve three squared is nine times four is thirty six four times two is eight two times three is six three squared is nine times three that's twenty seven so right now we can add these two twelve plus thirty six is forty 48 and if we move that to the other side of the equation it's going to be negative 48 on this side now 8 times 6 is 48. and then we have plus 27 dydx so at this point we can get rid of this stuff since we have like terms we can add these two numbers 48 plus 27 40 plus 20 is 60 8 plus 7 is 15 60 plus 15 is 75. so we have 75 dydx and that's equal to negative 48. so now we can divide both sides by 75. so dydx is equal to negative 48 over 75 when x is 2 and when y is 3. so this is equal to the slope of the tangent line at that point so now we have enough information to write the equation of the tangent line so we're going to use the point slope formula y minus y one is equal to m times x minus x one y1 is 3 x1 is 2. so this is going to be y minus 3 is equal to m m is negative 48 over 75 but we can reduce that let's divide the top and the bottom by three so this is negative 16 over 25 so let's replace m with that now x1 is two so this is the equation of the tangent line in point slope form so if this was a free response problem you could leave your answer like this and you'll be done with with it but this is a multiple choice problem and looking at the answers all of them are in standard form now sometimes you may need to solve for y sometimes the answers may be in slope intercept form y equals mx plus b but we need to get it in this form first so how can we do that one thing i recommend doing is getting rid of the fraction because we don't have that anywhere in any of the answer choices so let's multiply both sides by 25 so on the right side these two will cancel on the left side we're going to have 25y minus 75 and then it's going to be negative 16x and then negative 16 times negative 2 that's positive 32. now let's rearrange what we have i'm going to move the negative 16x from the right side to the left side so on the left side it's going to be positive 16x and then we're going to have plus 25y now the negative 75 i'm going to move it to this side on the right side it's going to be positive 75. so 32 plus positive 75 is positive 107. so this is the answer 16x plus 25y equals 107. that is the equation of the tangent line in standard form and so this matches answer choice d number seven which of the following answer choices is equivalent to the expression shown below so go ahead and think about it work out this problem now there's really no way in which we can work out this limit we have no numbers to plug in there's nothing to factor we can't rationalize the denominator or get any common denominators or none of that the only way to find the answer to this problem is to understand what it really means you need to know that f prime of x is equal to the limit as h approaches zero of f of x plus h minus f of x divided by h so this entire thing is equal to f prime of x and that's what you're looking for so what is f prime of x because that's going to give us the answer to this entire expression now first we need to know what f of x is notice that f of x lines up with sine x so if f of x is sine x what's f prime of x the derivative of sine x is cosine x and so this is the answer this entire thing is equal to cosine x so a is the right answer now let's work on number eight evaluate the integral shown below so how can we do this we can't use the power rule for this example but we could use something known as u-substitution what we're going to do is make u equal to three x squared plus five and so d u is going to be the derivative of that which is 6x times dx the derivative of a constant is 0. now what i recommend doing is dividing both sides by 6x to solve for dx so dx is going to be du divided by 6x in the next step we're going to replace 3x squared plus 5 with the u variable and at the same time we're going to replace the dx with what we have here so that's du over 6x so notice that all of the x variables have been canceled two over six we can reduce that to one over three and i'm going to move the constant in the front the square root of u is the same as u to the one half so now we can find the antiderivative of u to the one-half so we need to add one to it one-half plus one is three over two and then instead of dividing by three over two we can multiply by the reciprocal two over three and don't forget to put plus c so multiplying these two fractions it's going to give us two over nine and then we'll have u to the three halves plus c now our next step is to replace u with what we have here three x squared plus five so the final answer is two over nine three x squared plus five raised to the three over two plus c so that's how you could use u-substitution to find the anti-derivative of certain functions number 9 water is flowing into a cylinder with a diameter of 6 feet and a height of 10 feet if the height of the water in the cylinder is increasing at 3 feet per minute at what rate is the volume of the water in the cylinder changing now for those of you who want harder related rates problems you can check out the videos that i have on youtube so what i recommend doing is go into the search box and type in related rates problem organic chemistry tutor if you type in that phrase you're going to see all of the related rates problems that i have so for those of you who wish to improve your skills in this area feel free to take a look at that now whenever solving a related excuse me a related rates problems uh what you need to do is you need to write a formula so what we have is a cylinder so let's draw a picture so we know the diameter of the cylinder so that's 6 feet which means the radius of the cylinder has to be half of that so the radius is 3 feet the height of the cylinder is 10 feet now we have some water in the cylinder and more water is entering the cylinder now we know the height of the water in the cylinder is increasing at a rate of 3 feet per minute so what variable does that represent so this is the rate at which the height is changing with respect to time so it's three feet per minute and it's positive because it's increasing now the next thing we need to do is write the formula for this situation so we're dealing with volume and cylinder so what is the volume of a cylinder the volume of a cylinder is equal to the area of the base times the height of the cylinder and the base is a circle the area of a circle is pi r squared so the volume is pi r squared times height now we need to know which letters are constants and which ones are variables so v the volume would you say it's a variable or constant in this case v is a variable because the volume of the water in the cylinder is changing it's not constant pi is a constant it's always 3.14 now what about the radius of the water in the cylinder is that constant imagine the cylinder being filled up with water will the radius of the water change now we know that liquids they take up the shape of their container so because the radius of the cylinder is always three feet the radius of the water in the excuse me in the cylinder will always be three feet so the radius is a constant so pi r squared that whole expression is a constant now the height of the water is changing because as you add water the water level will rise so h is a variable now this is important because when you're dealing with related rates you're not differentiated with respect to x as you would using implicit differentiation you're differentiating with respect to time and the only thing you need to worry about are the variables not the constants because if r was changing when we differentiate it we would have to use the product rule but because this is a constant we do not have to use the product rule it's the same as differentiating 5x you wouldn't use the product rule for that or 8x cubed you don't use the product rule for that but if you have like x cubed times y squared where both of these are variables then you need to use the product rule but let's say if x was constant and y was a variable then you do not have to use the product rule you only need to use the product rule if you have two different variables being multiplied or if you have two variable expressions of the same type so e to the 4x that's one variable expression but using x and ln x is also using x but that's also a variable expression so you would still use the product rule in that case but if you have a constant times a variable you do not need to use the product rule so keep that in mind so the derivative of v with respect to time is dv dt now what is the derivative of pi r squared times h with respect to time if we were to differentiate 5h it would simply be 5 times dh dt the derivative of pi r squared times h will just be pi r squared and the derivative of h is one and then times dht so this is the constant like five so we just need to rewrite it now we have everything that we need to get the answer our goal is to calculate dv dt r doesn't change r is going to be 3 feet and dhdt that's changing at 3 feet per minute so 3 squared times 3 that's 27 thus the answer is going to be 27 pi now what are the units of dv dt because you also need to get that right the unit for h height would be like feet meters things like that now for volume it's like cubic feet cubic meters cubic inches so in this case it's cubic feet since h is in feet now the time dt is in minutes so this is going to be the same that's going to be in minutes as well thus it's 27 pi cubic feet per minute number 10 identify all intervals where the function f of x is increasing given f of x is equal to x cubed plus three over two x squared minus 36 x minus nine so in order to find the intervals where the function is increasing we need to identify the critical points and one way we can do that is by finding the first derivative and setting it equal to zero and solving for x so let's do that the derivative of x cubed is three 3x squared the derivative of x squared is 2x the derivative of x is 1 and the derivative of a constant is 0. so we have three x squared and then the twos will cancel so this is going to be plus three x minus thirty six so let's set this equal to zero now we can take out the gcf the greatest common factor so if we take out a three we're going to have x squared plus x minus 12. now let's factor the trinomial what two numbers multiply to negative 12 but add to one so this is going to be positive four and negative three four plus negative three is positive one and four times negative three is negative twelve now what we need to do at this point is set each factor equal to zero if you set x plus four equal to zero the critical point that you'll get will be negative 4 and if you set x minus 3 equal to 0 you'll get the critical point positive 3. so now what we need to do is make a number line by putting these critical points on it next we need to check the signs so let's pick a number greater than three let's say five if we plug in five into this expression into the first derivative will we get a positive number or a negative number now 5 minus 3 is a positive number 5 plus 4 is a positive number and this is positive so the result will be positive now what if we pick a number between negative four and three like zero will it be positive or negative zero minus three is negative zero plus four is positive a positive number times a negative number will give us a negative result now let's pick something less than negative four like negative five negative five plus four is negative negative five minus three is a negative number a negative times a negative number will give us a positive number all the way to the left we'll have negative infinity and to the right positive infinity now let's get rid of this one thing i do want to mention is that whenever the first derivative is equal to a positive number the function f of x is increasing whenever the first derivative is equal to a negative number so you have a negative slope then the function is decreasing so these are the signs for the first derivative so the function is increasing between negative infinity and negative four and it's also increasing between three and infinity it's decreasing between negative four and three so the answer we could say the function is increasing between negative four i mean between negative infinity to negative four union and then between three and infinity so this is the answer to the problem now something i do want to mention is that you could use this to determine the location of any relative maximum or relative minimum some textbooks might use the term local maximum or local minimum so here the function is increasing and then it's decreasing so this looks like a local maximum here it's decreasing and then increasing so this looks like a local minimum so that's how you can identify the relative extrema on a function using the same process number 11 identify the location and maximum value of the function f of x is equal to 16 x minus x squared plus five now the leading term is negative x squared it has the highest degree and the general shape of negative x squared is basically a downward parabola so for this particular graph there's only one location where it's a maximum the location of the maximum is the x value and the actual maximum value is the y coordinate so basically we need to find both the x y coordinate of our answer so how can we do it how can we use calculus to locate the maximum value of the function we need to find the critical point because at this region where we have a horizontal tangent line the slope is zero and so this is our critical point let's go ahead and find it so f prime of x is going to be the derivative of 16x is just 16. the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of 5 is 0. so if we set this equal to 0 all we need to do is factor out a two 16 divided by two is eight negative two x divided by two is just negative x and if we set eight minus x equal to zero if we add x to both sides x is eight so the critical point is eight so automatically that tells us that answer choice b is the right answer but let's finish the problem so if you were to plot this on a number line and let's say if you picked a number that's greater than eight like nine eight minus nine is negative if we plug in something less than eight like seven eight minus seven is positive so whenever the signs alternate from positive to negative going left to right you have a maximum it's increasing and then it's decreasing so we have a local max at eight now all we need to do to find the y coordinate is plug in the x value so f of 8 is going to be 16 times 8 minus 8 squared plus 5. now 16 times eight ten times eight is eighty six times eight is forty eight so eighty plus forty eight that's one twenty eight eight squared is sixty four one twenty eight minus sixty four is sixty four and 64 plus 5 is 69. now in case this problem was a free response problem and not a multiple choice you need to know that this is the maximum value of the function the y-coordinate now the location of the maximum value is located at the x-coordinate or at x equals eight so they ask you for the location of the critical point or the maximum value this is your answer if they ask you for the maximum value itself this is your answer so the function has a maximum value of 69. so b is the right answer for this problem now let's move on to 12. calculate the average value of the function f of x is equal to x cubed plus 8x minus 4 over the interval 1 to 5. so here's the basic idea behind calculating the average value so let's say we have some generic function f of x so basically what we're doing is we're taking the area under the curve and we're going to divide it by basically the width of the interval which is an x value and that's going to give us an average y value so our goal is to calculate this average y value of the function so here's the formula that we need the average function value or the average y value is going to be 1 divided by the width of the interval times the area under the curve in that interval which is the definite integral from a to b of f of x to dx so this right here represents the area under the curve and this portion represents the width of the interval which as we said is an x value and that will give us the average function value so what is a and what is b a as we can see is one b is five so this is going to be one over five minus one times the definite integral from one to five and then the function is x cubed plus eight x minus four dx five minus one is four so this becomes one over four now we need to find the anti-derivative of that expression the anti-derivative of x cubed is x to the fourth divided by four and for eight x is going to be eight x squared divided by two which is four x squared and the antiderivative of negative four is uh going to be negative 4x and now we need to evaluate this from 1 to 5. now before we do so it might be advantageous to distribute the 1 4 to everything inside the brackets so it's going to be 1 over 16 times x to the fourth and then these fours will cancel so that's going to be plus x squared and these fours will cancel as well so minus x evaluated from one to five so first let's plug in five so it's going to be one over 16 times 5 to the fourth power and then plus 5 squared minus 5 and then we could plug in 1. so it's going to be 1 over 16 plus 1 minus 1. now five to the fourth power that's 625 and then that's divided by 16. 5 squared is 25 and then we have negative 1 over 16 and 1 minus 1 is 0. now 625 over 16 minus 1 over 16 that becomes 6 24 over 16. and 25 minus 5 is 20. now 624 divided by 16 that's 39. so it's 39 plus 20 which is 59. so this is the average y value of the function over the interval one to five therefore c is the right answer number thirteen evaluate the expression shown below so what is the derivative of two x cubed minus seven x squared raised to the eighth power for this problem we need to use something called the chain rule perhaps you've seen it expressed this way the derivative of a composite function let's say f of g of x is going to be f prime of g of x times g prime of x so notice that we differentiate the outside portion of the function keeping the inside the same and then we're going to multiply by the derivative of the inside of the function we're going to follow that same process to differentiate this expression so think of the outside portion of the function as x to the eighth that's like f of x and think of the inside function g of x as being two x cubed minus seven x squared so let's differentiate the outside portion the derivative of x to the eight would be eight x to the seventh power so we're gonna do is we're gonna move the eight to the front now instead of writing x we're going to keep everything that we have on the inside exactly the same and then we're going to subtract this by one so that's going to be seven next we're going to take the derivative of the inside function to get our g prime so the derivative of two x cubed is six x squared and the derivative of 7x squared is 14x and since this is a free response question we can leave our answer like this now for those of you who may want to simplify the answer we could take out the gcf in this expression so we could take out a 2x so multiplying 8 by 2x that's going to give us 16x and then we have 2x cubed minus 7x squared raised to the seventh power and now that we've taken out 2x we need to divide everything there by 2x 6x squared divided by 2x is 3x negative 14x divided by 2x is negative 7. so you could leave your answer like this if you want to so that's how you could use the chain rule now for those of you who want more examples on the chain rule particularly harder examples i already have a video on that on youtube just type in chain rule organic chemistry tutor and you can get more examples on this if you need more help on this topic so let's move on to the next problem number 14 evaluate the limit expression shown below now let's say if you get a limit problem like this and you have no idea what to do it turns out that you can evaluate any limit if you have access to a calculator if that is allowed on your test if it's a free response problem and you can't use the calculator you just have to know the techniques involved but let's say if you do have access to a calculator what you could do is plug in a number that's close to four let's say 4.1 so type this in your calculator and make sure to use parentheses so you should get this f of 4.1 is negative point zero six zero nine seven five now do the same thing for a number that's closer to four so if we try four point zero one if you type this in you should get negative point zero six two three four notice that it's converging to a value it's getting close to negative point zero six something and you can go even further you can try 4.001 i'm going to try that so you should get negative point zero six two 4 8 with some other numbers so we could see that it's around negative point zero six the answer can't be a one over four is point two five it can't be b negative two thirds is negative point six repeating negative eight and twelve are out now e is the answer this is negative point zero six two five if you type a negative 1 over 16 in your calculator and so that's one simple method that you could use to evaluate any limit if you don't know what to do if you have access to a calculator but now let's solve this the appropriate way what should we do if we have fractions within fractions if you have a complex fraction eliminate the smaller fractions by multiplying the top and the bottom by the common denominator of these two small fractions which is going to be 4x now let's distribute the 4x so 4x times 1 over x the x variables will cancel and so we're just going to get 4 on top now 4x times 1 4 the fours will cancel and so we're just going to get negative x on top and on the bottom don't distribute it just rewrite it as 4x times x minus 4. now what's our next step here what do you think we need to do at this point what i recommend doing is factoring out a negative one from four minus x if you take out a negative one from negative x negative x changes to positive x and if you take out a negative one from positive four it becomes negative four so notice that we can cancel x minus four so now we have the limit as x approaches four for negative one over four x so now we can use direct substitution so replacing x with four we're going to get negative one over sixteen so this is the final answer answer choice e number 15 identify all intervals where the function f of x is concave downward now before we attempt this problem let's write down some notes let's summarize what we need to know when the first derivative is positive you need to know that the function f of x is increasing and when the first derivative is negative the function f of x is decreasing now when f prime of x is equal to zero you have a horizontal tangent line and you also have a critical point what about the second derivative when the second derivative is positive the function f of x is said to be concave up when the second derivative is negative the function f of x is said to be concave down and when it's equal to zero f of x has an inflection point if the concavity changes that is if the second derivative changes from negative to positive or positive to negative if it doesn't change sign it's not an inflection point so for this particular problem we are concerned with this information so let's go ahead and find the second derivative and set it equal to zero let's start with the first derivative f prime of x the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared the derivative of x squared is 2x times negative 6 that's negative 12x and the derivative of 5x is 5. and the derivative of the constant one is a zero now let's calculate the second derivative the derivative of three x squared is going to be six x and the derivative of negative twelve x is just negative twelve let's set the second derivative equal to zero and let's factor out a six so now if we set x minus two equal to zero we could see that we have a point of interest at x equals two so we're going to make a number line and we're going to test the signs so if we pick a number greater than 2 like 3 3 minus 2 is positive if we pick a number less than 2 like 1 1 minus 2 is negative so the second derivative will be negative if you plug in 1 into this expression always put your infinity signs so notice that 2 is an inflection point because the concavity the second derivative changes sign on the left side the second derivative is negative which means that the function is concave down on the right side because the second derivative is positive it's concave up there so for this particular problem the interval where the function is concave down is from negative infinity to 2. so that's when the second derivative is negative you 

Transcript for: Integration By Parts
so how can we find the indefinite integral of x times e raised to the x to do this we need to use something called integration by parts the integral of u dv is equal to u times v minus the integral of v d u so we need to determine u dv v and u and d u let me put it in a different order so which one should we set equal to u and which one should we set equal to dv it's best to set u equal to x because if we do so d u will simply be equal to one times dx and when dealing with constants they're a lot easier to integrate than variables so we're going to make dv equal to e to the x dx now v is the integral of dv the integral of e to the x is simply e to the x so now using the formula u times v that's going to be x times e raised to the x minus the integral of v d u v is e to the x d u is 1 dx and the integral of e to the x is e to the x plus some constant c so this is the final answer that's the integral of x raised to the or x times e raised to the x let's try another problem let's integrate x times sine x dx so what should we make u and dv equal to so just like before i'm going to make u equal to x so that d u is going to be 1 dx now dv has to be what remains sine x dx now what is the integral of sine the derivative of what function will give us sign the integral of sine is negative cosine the derivative of negative cosine is positive sine so using the formula the integral of u dv is equal to u times v minus the integral of v d u so u is x v is negative cosine x and then minus v and d u is 1 dx so far we have negative x cosine x and then these two negative signs will become positive so plus the integral of cosine x dx now the antiderivative of positive cosine is positive sine so the final answer is what you see here negative cosine i mean negative x cosine x plus sine x plus c now here's another problem to work on let's integrate x squared ln x so what should we make u and dv equal to in this problem if we make u equal to x squared and we make dv equal to ln x dx the integral of ln x will be quite difficult to do unless you know what it is so we're not going to do that so it's best to make dv x squared dx and u is going to be ln x because we know the derivative of l and x the derivative of l and x is 1 over x and the antiderivative of x squared the antiderivative of dv will give us v so the antiderivative of x squared dx is x cubed over 3. so let's use the formula now u times v that's going to be ln x times x cubed over three minus the integral of v times d u and d u is one over x it's supposed to be dx so this is equal to 1 3 x cubed times ln x and then we could cancel an x and so we have minus one third the integral of x squared dx the integral of x squared is going to be x to the third over three and then plus some constant c so the final answer is one third x cubed ln x minus one over nine x to the third plus c and that concludes this problem so let's work on some more examples let's try this problem what is the anti-derivative of the natural log of x how can we use integration by parts to get this answer now we can't make u equal well we can't make a dv equal to l and x because we don't know the integral of l and x we're trying to figure that out so therefore we have to make u equal to ln x the derivative of that is one over x dx dv has to be just we can make dv dx if we want to or one dx and so v the integral of one dx is just x so now let's start with the formula and so it's going to be u times v u is ln x and v is x minus the integral of v and then d u is one over x dx so far we have x ln x x times one over x the x variables cancel so we have the integral of one dx now the integral of one dx is x so this is the final answer x ln x minus x plus c that is the integral of the natural log of x let's find the indefinite integral of x squared sine x dx so which part should be u and which part is going to be dv we need to make u equal to x squared and we need to differentiate it twice to bring it down to a constant so this is one of those problems where you have to use integration of you know integration by parts two times d u is going to be 2x dx dv is sine x dx so this is dv and this is going to be u the integral of sine is negative cosine so let's start with the formula so u times v that's x squared times negative cosine x minus the integral of v which is negative cosine x times d u that's 2x dx so let's organize what we have negative x squared cosine x and then these two negative signs will become positive so positive the integral of 2x cosine x we could take the 2 and move it to the front so it's just going to be x cosine x now we need to use the integration by parts formula on the integral of x cosine x we're going to make u equal to x and dv is going to be cosine x dx the integral of cosine is sine and the derivative of x is 1 dx so using the formula it's going to be u times v which is x times sine x minus the integral of v d u so v is sine x d u is just dx and so the integral of sine is negative cosine and then plus c so now what we need to do is replace this part with what we have here so it's going to be plus we need to distribute 2 to everything in here so it's going to be 2x sine x plus this would be plus cosine x but times two so plus two cosine x and we don't need to multiply c by two because c is just some generic constant and this whole thing is equal to the original integral and so this is the answer negative x squared cosine x plus 2x sine x plus 2 cosine x plus c now let's work on this problem let's say we have the integral of x squared e to the x dx go ahead and try that problem so let's begin by writing the formula the integral of u dv is equal to u times v minus the integral of v d u now what should we make u equal to and what should be dv i prefer making dv e c x dx because once we integrate it it's going to stay the same and i want x square to eventually become a constant so this is one of those problems where you need to do use the integration by parts formula twice so we're going to make u equal to x squared du is going to be 2x dx so using the formula it's going to be uv that's going to be x squared that's you v is e to the x minus the integral of v which is e to the x times d u that's 2x dx so now this becomes well before we uh do that let's use integration by parts one more time so i'm going to make u equal to 2x du is going to be the derivative of 2x which is 2 but times dx dv we're going to make that equal to e x dx just like we did before and the integral of that is simply e x so we're going to have x squared e x and then minus now let's use the formula again for this part so it's uv so 2x e to the x and then minus the integral of vdu so that's 2 e to the x dx or multiplying those two now let's begin by distributing the negative signs so this is going to be negative 2x e to the x and then these two negatives will cancel giving us positive well let's take out the two so positive two integral e to the x dx so our final answer is going to be x squared e c x minus 2 x e to the x anti derivative of e to the x is just e to the x and then plus c now if we want to we can factor out e to the x so we're going to have x squared minus 2x plus 2 and then plus the constant c so this right here is our final answer that is the anti-derivative of x squared e to the x what about this problem what is the integral of ln x squared dx try that so for this problem what we need to do is we need to make u equal to ln x squared dv is going to be equal to the other part we're going to make dv equal to dx so v is going to be the integral of dx which is x d u i'm going to write that here i need more space we need to use the chain rule so first let's use the power rule by moving the 2 to the front so it's going to be 2 and then we'll keep everything on the inside the same 2 times ln x and then we're going to subtract that by 1 and then take the derivative of the inside the derivative of l and x is one over x so using the formula this is going to be u times v so v is x u is ln x squared minus the integral of v d u v is x d u is 2 ln x times 1 of x and then let's not forget the dx part so we can cancel x and one of x so this becomes x ln x squared and then we could take out the two we can move it to the front so minus two integral ln x dx earlier in this video we determined that the integral of l and x is x ln x minus x so this is going to be -2 and then we can replace this with x ln x minus x now let's go ahead and distribute the two so our final answer is going to be x times ln x squared minus 2x ln x and then negative 2 times negative x that's going to be positive 2x and then plus c so this is the indefinite integral of ln x squared now what would you do if you were to see a problem like this ln x to the seventh power dx go ahead and try that well first you need to realize that we can rewrite this problem a property of logs allows us to move the exponent to the front so make sure you understand this this is not ln x to the seventh power like this if it was we can't move the seven the seven is only affecting the x variable as a result we can move the 7 to the front so this becomes 7 ln x so this is what we're integrating this is equivalent to 7 integral ln x dx and we know the anti-derivative of l and x it's x ln x minus x so this is our final answer it's just 7 x ln x minus 7 x plus c now let's try this one let's find the indefinite integral of e raised to the x sine x dx go ahead and work on that so for this problem i want to make u equal to sine x and then dv i'm going to set that equal to e to the x dx so v is simply going to be e to the x d u is the derivative of sine x which is cosine x so using the formula it's going to be uv that's going to be e sine x minus the integral of v d u so v is e to the x d u is cosine x dx so we need to use integration by parts one more time but this time we're going to make u equal to cosine x instead of sine and dv is going to be the same dv is going to be e to the x dx if v is the same d u is going to be the derivative of cosine which is negative sine and then times dx so now we're going to have e x sine x minus and then in brackets u v so that's going to be e x cosine x minus the integral of v to u so v is e to the x d u is negative sine x and then dx so let's go ahead and distribute the negative sign i'm going to rewrite the original integral so the integral of e x sine x that's going to be e to the x sine x these two negative signs will become positive and then we need to distribute this negative so it's negative e raised to the x cosine x and then we need to apply the negative to this which is going to be negative e to the x sine x now the key to solving this problem is to realize that this term is very similar to the original problem so what we want to do is we want to add this to both sides if we move it to the other side we're going to have 2 e x sine x which is equal to this now we want to find the value of just one integral e to the x sine x so what we need to do is divide both sides by two so that's we can say that our final answer is one half we also factor out e to the x so it's one half e to the x and then times sine x minus cosine x plus c so that's the anti-derivative of e raised to the x times sine x now let's move on to our next example let's find the antiderivative of ln x squared divided by x dx so go ahead and try that now the first thing that i want to do is i'm going to rewrite this as ln x squared times 1 over x dx i want to multiply as a product of two functions now what i'm going to do is i'm going to make u equal to ln x squared du will be 2 times ln x to the first power times 1 over x and then dx so since i made u ln x squared dv is going to be the other part dv is going to be 1 over x dx so anti-derivative of 1 over x is ln x now using the formula this is going to be u times v u is ln x squared v is just lnx minus the integral of vdu so v is ln x d u is 2 ln x times 1 over x dx so let's put this all together so first i'm going to rewrite the original problem that's equal to ln x squared times ln x that's ln x raised to the third power in this 2 i'm going to move to the front here we have ln x times ln x that's ln x squared and it's multiplied by one over x which we can move that to the bottom and we need to realize that these two terms are similar so we need to add this to both sides or if we move it to the other side we'll basically add in 1 plus 2 which will become 3. so on the left side we're going to have 3 integral ln x squared over x dx and that's going to equal ln x to the third power so if we divide both sides by 3 this 3 will disappear and we're going to have it underneath here and then plus our constant c so this is the answer to the original problem that's how we can find the integral of ln x squared over x now for the sake of practice go ahead and try this finding a definite integral of e to the 3x cosine 4x dx so whenever you have an e to the x times the sine or cosine it's good to make the cosine part equal to u that's what i'd like to do personally so in this one i'm going to make u equal to cosine 4x du the derivative of cosine is going to be negative sine 4x and then times the derivative of the angle the derivative of 4x is 4 and then we're going to have times dx so dv in this problem is going to be e to the 3x to dx the antiderivative of e to the 3x it's e to the 3x over 3 which we can write as one third e to the 3x so using the formula it's going to be uv so that's 1 3 e to the 3x times cosine 4x minus the integral of v d u so v is one third e to the three x d u that's negative four sine 4x dx so what we're going to do now is we're going to move the constants to the front the two negative signs will cancel they will become positive and we can move one third times four to the front so this is going to be plus four over three integral e to the three x sine four x dx now we need to use integration by parts one more time so dv will be the same we don't need to adjust this part of the formula but u is going to be sine 4x as opposed to cosine for x so du is going to change as well the derivative of sine is cosine 4x and then times 4 times dx so using integration by parts we're going to have u times v so that's one-third e to the 3x times sine 4x and then minus the integral of vdu so v is one third e to the three x and then d u that's times four cosine four x d x now let's go ahead and distribute four over three so multiply those together that's going to be 4 over 9 e to the 3x sine 4x and then this 2 will also be 4 over 9 but it's going to be negative four over nine actually there's a four here so this is four thirds times four thirds so that's 16 over nine with a negative sign and then we're going to have the integral of e to the 3x cosine 4x dx now notice that these two are similar so we're going to add 16 over 9 integral e to the 3x cosine 4xdx to both sides so this is 1 but we can treat it as if it's 9 over 9 just to get common denominators so 9 over 9 plus 16 over 9 that's going to be 25 over 9 integral e to the 3x cosine 4x dx and then that's going to be 1 3 e to the 3x cosine 4x and then plus 4 over 9 e to the 3x sine 4x now to get this to 1 what we're going to do is we're going to multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 25 over nine so that is by nine over twenty five so those two fractions will cancel on the left side we're just going to have e to the three x cosine four x dx and what i'm going to do i want to keep this in factored form so we have 9 over twenty five from one third and four over nine we can factor out one third and we can also factor out e to the three x so here we took out e to the three x we're left with just cosine four x here we took out e to the three x and we took out one third from four over nine so we're gonna have four thirds left over times sine 4x the last thing we could do is maybe reduce this so if we divide both numbers by 3 this becomes 3 over 25 e to the 3x and then times cosine 4x plus 4 over 3 sine 4x plus c so that's going to be the answer for this problem that's the indefinite integral of e to the 3x cosine 4x you

what is the indefinite integral of x cosine squared x times tangent x feel free to try this problem if you want to go ahead and pause the video take a minute to work on it now the first thing we need to do is simplify if possible cosine squared is basically cosine x times cosine x tangent is sine divided by cosine so at this point we can cancel a cosine expression and so we're going to have the integral of x sine x cosine x now it's important to understand that the double angle formula sine two x is equal to two sine x cosine x so therefore if we multiply both sides by a half we can get this expression one half sine 2x is going to equal sine x cosine x and so let's replace sine cosine with one half sine 2x so now we have this expression moving the one half to the front we have one half times the integral of x sine 2x so the original expression is equivalent to this expression now in order to find the integral of this expression we need to use a process known as integration by parts here's the formula for that the integral of u dv is gonna equal u times v minus the integral of v d u so what we're gonna do is we're gonna make x equal to the u variable and dv is going to be equal to sine 2x dx so i'm going to write that on the top right section of the screen so u is x which means du is equal to the derivative of x which is 1 times dx dv is sine 2x dx v is the antiderivative of dv so the anti-derivative of sine 2x is going to be negative cosine 2x divided by 2 because of the 2x part the derivative of 2x is 2. so now let's plug in everything into this formula so first we have one half times u v u is x v is this right here i'm going to rewrite that as negative one half x cosine two x that's u v minus the integral of v d u so v is negative one half cosine two x times d u which is dx so we have negative times negative one-half so that's going to be positive one-half which i'm going to move in front of the integral so this is positive one-half integral cosine 2x dx now what i'm going to do at this point is i'm going to distribute the one half to these two terms so this is going to equal negative 1 4 x cosine 2x and then plus 1 4 the integral of cosine 2x dx so now i need to find the anti-derivative of cosine 2x the antiderivative of cosine 2x is sine two x divided by two so this becomes negative one fourth x cosine two x plus one fourth times sine two x over two and then plus the constant c so the final answer for this problem is going to be negative 1 4 x cosine 2 x plus 1 over 8 sine 2x plus the constant of integration so this is the answer to the original problem so that's equal to the integral or the indefinite integral of x cosine squared x times tangent x so that's the final answer 

Transcript for: Integration By Parts - Tabular Method
in this video we're going to talk about how to perform integration by parts using a very quick method known as the tabular method so let's start with this problem what is the integral of x squared e to the x dx how can we use the tabular method to get the answer well first let's make a table in the first column we're going to put the signs and in the second column the derivative and in the third column integrals now when dealing with integration by parts you have this formula the integral of u dv is equal to u times v minus the integral of v d u notice that the first term has a positive sign and the second term has a negative sign so therefore the signs will alternate the first one is going to be positive the second one negative the third is going to be positive and for the fourth term it's going to be negative now to use integration by parts we need to make u equal to x squared and dv is going to be equal to e to the x dx but let's not worry about the dx term for now so for the derivative section u is going to be equal to x squared and then we're going to find the derivatives of u so u prime the derivative of x squared is 2x and then u double prime that's going to be 2 u triple prime the derivative of a constant is 0. now dv we said it's going to be e to the x and the integral of dv is v and the integral of e to the x is e to the x let's call this v1 the first integral v2 the second integral it's going to be the same the integral of each dx will change and the third integral is going to stay the same so now to get the answer for the first term you're going to start with the first sign and the first entry in the derivative column multiplied by the second entry in the integral column so it's going to be plus x squared times e to the x that's the first term of the answer now the second term it has a negative sign 2x and then it's going to be multiplied by e to the x so it's going to be negative 2x e to the x and for the third term it's going to have a positive side a 2 and e to the x as well so it's just plus 2 e to the x now the next term u triple prime is 0 and 0 times anything is 0 so we don't have to worry about that so we could just add plus c at this point so this is the answer and now you know how to do integration by parts the faster using the tablet method so let's work on some more examples let's try this problem find the definite integral or rather the indefinite integral of x cubed sine x dx feel free to pause the video if you want to try so let's begin with the table so we're going to have signs that's going to be in the first column then the derivative for the u term and then the integral for dv so the first term is going to have a positive sign the next one is going to be negative and then positive and negative and so forth so we can differentiate x cubed to zero so we want to make u equal to x cubed we can write that on the side u is going to be equal to x cubed dv that's going to be equal to sine x dx so u prime is going to be the derivative of x cubed which is 3x squared and then u double prime that's going to be the derivative of 3x squared so that's 6x and the derivative of 6x is six and if we differentiate it one more time it's going to be zero so let's put a positive sign here which we really don't need the fifth row i'm just gonna write it now let's focus on dv so dv is sine x and the integral of sine x that's going to be the derivative of cosine is negative sine so the derivative of negative cosine is positive sign so the integral of sine is negative cosine and the integral of cosine is sine so the integral of negative cosine is negative sine and the integral of negative sign is cosine and the integral of positive cosine is positive sine so just to check you could say the derivative of sine is cosine the derivative of cosine is negative sine the derivative of negative sign is negative cosine and the derivative of cosine is negative sine so the derivative of negative cosine is sine so you can go backwards and check to make sure if you did it correctly now the first answer is going to have the first sign the first term in the second column and the second entry in the third column so this is going to be negative x cubed cosine x because we have a positive sign here and a negative sign there now for the second term it's going to have a negative sign 3x squared and then we're going to multiply it by negative sine x so there's two negative signs we have to deal with so it's going to be positive 3x squared sine x now for the next one it's going to have a positive sign we're going to multiply it by 6x and cosine x so it's going to be positive 6x cosine x and for the next term let's use a different color it's going to have a negative sign we're going to multiply by 6 and sine x so it's going to be negative 6 sine x and once you get to 0 you can stop there and then plus c so this is the final answer that's the integral of x cubed sine x dx now let's work on another problem find the antiderivative of x to the fifth times ln x now for this problem i wouldn't recommend using the integration by parts tabular method because you can do this simply using the integration by parts formula once and it's best to use the original method instead of the tabular method now we're going to make u equal to ln x as opposed to x to the fifth because you need to do integration by parts to even find the integral of l and x so it's easier to find the derivative of ln x which is one of x so that means that dv has to be x to the fifth times dx since u is ln x now v that's going to be the integral of dv so the antiderivative of x to the fifth is going to be x to the sixth divided by six or one over six times x to the sixth so using the formula the integral of u dv is u times v minus the integral of v d u so u times v that's ln x times one sixth x to the sixth so that's going to be one over six x to the sixth l and x and then minus the integral of v which is one over six x to the sixth times d u and that's one over x dx notice that we can integrate the result of this expression so let's go ahead and do that but first let's rewrite the expression so let's take the constant one over six and move it to the front so it's going to be minus one over six and then the integral symbol x to the sixth divided by x that's gonna be x to the fifth power now the antiderivative of x to the fifth using the power rule is going to be x to the sixth divided by six plus some constant c so the final answer is one over six x to the six l and x and then we have six times six which is thirty six so it's going to be minus 1 over 36 x to the 6 plus c and so for this problem i would recommend using the tablet method because there's no need you only need to use the integration by parts formula just once now let's go back to that problem the integral of x to the fifth l and x dx and let's talk about why we can't use the tableau method so we're gonna have s for sines d for derivatives i for integrals now we need to make u equal to l and x because if we made dv ln x as we mentioned before we have to integrate ln x using integration by parts to find v so it's easy to make u l and x and so dv is going to be x to the fifth dx because it's easy to integrate x to the fifth so let's put our signs so u is l and x dv is x to the fifth the derivative of ln x is one over x and the derivative of one over x is negative one over x squared and if we differentiate negative one over x squared it's going to be we need to rewrite it and then use the power rule so it's positive two x to the negative three and so that's two over x to the third so notice that we're not going to get a zero in this column and for this column the antiderivative of x to the fifth is x to the sixth divided by six or 1 6 times x to the sixth and the antiderivative of this is going to be x to the 7 and 6 times 7 is 42 so that's going to be 1 over 42 and notice that the exponents are increasing so there's no way we can get a zero and whenever you see a situation like this it's best not to use the tabular method so i just want to make sure that you're aware of that so what about this problem the integral of e to the x sine x dx can we use the tabular method for this problem what do you think well let's try it so let's have signs derivatives and integrals let's make u equal to sine x because it's easy to find the derivative of sine and let's make dv e to the x to dx so first we have a positive sign and for the u terms we're going to put sine x here and for the for dv we have uh e to the x the derivative of sine is cosine and the integral of e to the x is e to the x and so this column is not going to change the derivative of cosine is negative sine and the derivative of negative sign is negative cosine so the derivatives and the integrals of sine and e to the x they're repetitive as you can see and so we're not going to get a zero anywhere in any of these two columns so let's not use the tablet method for this problem we need to use just integration by parts old style so we're going to keep u as sine x and dv as each dx dx so du is going to be cosine x dx and v is just e3x so let's write the formula first the integral of u dv is u times v minus the integral of v d u so u times v that's going to be e to the x times sine x and then minus the integral of v which is e to the x times d u cosine x dx so now we need to use the integration by parts formula for this integral so i'm going to make u equal to cosine and v is dv is going to be east dx dx so let's write that so u is going to be cosine x dv e to the x dx so v is e to the x and d u is going to be negative sine x dx so this is going to be the integral of e to the sine x i mean e to the x sine x dx and that's equal to e to the x sine x and then minus and then it's going to be u times v so e to the x cosine x minus the integral of v d u v is e to the x d u is negative sine x dx so let's simplify what we have let's begin by distributing the negative sign that we see here so this is going to be negative e to the x cosine x and then we have three negative signs to deal with so a negative times a negative times a negative it's simply a negative so this is going to be negative integral e to the x sine x now notice that we have common terms here so what we're going to do is we're going to add the integral of e sine x dx to both sides so on the right side these will cancel on the left side we have 2 times the integral of e to the x sine x dx and that's equal to e to the x sine x minus e to the x cosine x now all we need to do is multiply both sides by a half and so this will give us the final answer on the left side two times a half is one so the integral of e x sine x dx is going to be one half e to the x sine x minus e to the x cosine x and don't forget to add plus c and so this is the answer so sometimes it's best to use the integration by parts formula other times it's better to use the tablet method and i would use the tablet method for problems that look like this let's say if you have x to the 4 sine x this can go to 0 but this part repeats or if you have let's say the integral of x to the 7 e to the 4x x to the 7 you could differentiate it to 0 but e to the 4x is a repetitive function when you find the derivative for the integral so for problems like these two you can use the tablet method you 

Transcript for: Integration By Parts Formula Derivation
let's talk about the integration by parts formula how can we derive that formula the integration by parts formula is basically the reverse of the product rule so let's start with that let's say we have two functions f and g which are both functions of x and we're going to take the derivative of those two functions which are multiplied to each other so using the product rule it's going to be the derivative of the first function times the original of the second function Plus the first function times the derivative of the second function so we get F Prime G Plus f g Prime now in order to get the integration for my parts formula we need to integrate this expression so let's put an integral symbol for each of these now on the left if you have a derivative and integration these two will negate each other so you're just going to get F times G on the right we do need to add DX once we are integrating this expression so I'm going to write that in the next line so this is going to be the integral of f Prime times G of X DX Plus the integral of f of x times G Prime DX now what we need to do is rearrange this equation and we need to solve for this expression so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this term and move it to the other side so it's positive on the right side but it's going to be negative on the left side so I'm going to have f of x GX and then minus the integral of f Prime of x g x DX and that's going to equal the integral of f times G Prime now what I'm going to do next is I'm going to reverse the two equations so I'm gonna rewrite the right side on the left side and the stuff on the left side I'm going to rewrite it on the right side so the integral of f times G Prime is going to be F times G minus the integral of f Prime G DX now we're going to start introducing the u and v variables let's say that U is equal to f of x if that's the case then V will be equal to G of x differentiating both sides of that expression U becomes d u the derivative of f of x becomes F Prime of X DX the derivative of V will become DV and the derivative of G of X will be G Prime of X DX so now let's replace what we have in this in this expression with u and v so f of x that's going to be U and G Prime of X DX will be DV so on the left we have the integral of U times DV and here we have F times G f is u g is V so that becomes u v minus the integral of so G of G of X is simply V and F Prime of X DX which we could see here that's going to be d u so we have a V and we have a d u and this is the integration by parts formula the integral of U DV is equal to u v minus the integral of vdu so that's how you could derive it by the way for those of you who want some example problems on how to use this formula to integrate certain expressions feel free to check out the links in the description section below I'm also going to include some more difficult examples that relates to integration by parts so feel free to check out those videos in the links below

what is the integral of e ra 3x * cosine 4X now you could find the answer by using the formula of integration by parts and here it is the integral of U DV is UV minus the integral of V du Now using this formula will'll get you the right answer but it's a process it takes time in fact there's a video that I've created that shows you how to find the integral of this exact problem using the integration by parts formula I'm actually going to post a link to that video in the description section below and this problem is the last problem in that video it starts around the 25 minute 20 second Mark now this is basically the long way of getting the answer in this particular video instead of using integration by parts I'm going to show you another formula that will get you the same answer directly and here it is the integral of e to the ax time cosine BX is equal to e raised to the ax / a 2 + + b ^ 2 * a cosine BX plus b sin BX and then plus the constant C so in this problem we need to identify a and b a is three B is 4 so I'm going to write that here so this is going to be e raised to the 3x over a^ 2 which is 3 squ and then plus b^2 which is 4^2 by the way for those of you who want more formulas like this in addition to other integration formulas I'm going to post a link to a formula sheet that you can download that has a lot of integration formulas that will help you to get to the answer a lot faster now going back to this problem we have a cosine BX a is 3 B is 4 so 3 cosine 4X plus b which is 4 and then sin BX or 4X and then finally plus the constant C so that right there is the answer but now if you're going to compare it to the answer that I have in my other integration by parts video it's going to look a little different and I'll explain why first let's simplify what we have here 3 2 is 9 4 2 is 16 9 + 16 is 25 now what I'm going to do next is I'm going to factor out of three if I fact R of three from what's inside here I'm going to divide each of these by three so when I factor out a 3 from 3 cosine 4X I'm just going to have cosine 4X but the three I'm going to put it in front of the e to the X so this is cosine 4X if I factor out of three from four I basically divide the 4 by 3 so this becomes 4/3 sin 4X now this is the exact answer that I have in my other video after using the integration by parts formula however it's a lot better to leave the answer in this form but I want you I want you to see how this answer will lead to the other answer that I have in my other video so you know that it's correct now for the sake of practice let's work on another example let's find the integral of e raed to 5x time sin to the 12x DX now the formula that you need for this one is this e raised to the ax * sin BX is equal the first part is the same e to the a x over a 2 + b 2 and then time a sin BX minus B cosine BX and then of course plus C so for this particular problem we can see that a is five and B is 12 so once we identify the values of the values of A and B we can quickly get the answer so e to the ax that's e to 5x / a^ 2 a 2 is 5^ 2 b^ 2 is 12 2 and then a sin BX a is 5 sin BX so that's sin 12x - B cosine sin BX so that's -12 cosine 12x and then plus C which I'm run out of space there so now let's simplify this answer 5 2 is 25 12 * 12 is 144 144 + 25 is 169 so we could leave the final answer like this as you could see using this formula helps you to get the answer a lot faster than using the integration by parts formula so that's how you can find the integral or the anti-derivative of any problem in this form either e to the x sinx or any variation of e to the x cosine X it will work for both so by the way if you want those formulas as well as a print out of some other integration formulas don't forget to check out uh the links in the description section below I'm also going to put some other links to other videos related to integration by parts uh such as the tab method I don't know if you heard about that one but that also helps with integration my parts problems where there's a lot of repeat steps I'm also going to be posting some other links as well that you might be covering in school at this particular time so feel free to take a look at that content and for those of you who want access to my calculates video playlist you could find it at my website video-test final exam on that website 

Transcript for: Calculus - Integration By Parts
here is a question for you how do you find the indefinite integral of that we have a three product term expression how do you integrate that perhaps you're familiar with integration by parts and you've seen this formula the integral of u dv is equal to u times v minus the integral of vdu now this works for a two product term expression but what about a three product term expression well before we can derive the formula that will help us get the answer let's talk about how we can derive this formula because if we can understand that process we can apply it to a three product term expression we need to start with the product rule the integration by parts is basically a reverse or the reverse process of finding the derivative using the product rule so let's say we have a two product term expression u times v the derivative of u times v is going to be you take the derivative of the first part u which becomes u prime times v plus u times the derivative of the second part v prime so that's the product rule now u prime if we differentiate it with respect to x is going to be d u d x and v prime is going to be dv over dx so what i'm going to do at this point is multiply every term by dx so i now have uv prime dx is equal to v d u plus u dv so at this point what i'm going to do now is i'm going to move this term to the other side so i have uv prime dx minus vdu is equal to u dv now i'm going to reverse the equation i'm going to take this move it to the other side and this move it to that side so reversing the equation we're basically just switching it i have u dv is equal to uv prime dx minus v du so now let's take the integral of both sides so this becomes the integral of u dv the integral of uv prime is just going to be uv because here you're taking the derivative and then you're integrating it which are basically reverse processes of each other so it's like a double reverse so you just get u v minus the integral of v to u so that's a simple way in which we can derive the integration by parts formula from the product rule of finding derivatives now let's apply that same process to a three product term expression so let's find the derivative of u v w so first we need to differentiate the first part so we're going to get u prime leaving the other two the same next we need to differentiate the second part that is v so that's going to be v prime leaving u and w the same and then we're going to differentiate the third part leaving the first two variables the same so that's how we could find the derivative of the three product term expression so now at this point let's replace u prime with du dx and we're going to replace v prime with dv dx and w prime with dw dx and like before we're going to multiply every term by dx so these will cancel and so we're going to get u v w prime times dx and that's going to equal v w d u plus u w d v plus uv dw now i'm going to take these two terms and move it to the other side so i'm going to have u v w prime d x minus v w d u minus u w d v and that's going to equal u v d w and i'm going to reverse both equations so we're going to have u v d w is equal to u v w prime times d x minus v w d u minus u w dv now we're gonna integrate every expression or integrate both sides of the equation so the final answer is this the integral of u v dw is going to be this becomes just uvw minus the integral of v w d u minus the integral of u w dv so this is the integration by parts formula for a three product term expression so let's apply this formula to the original problem so we have the integral of x sine x e to the 2x dx so u is going to equal x v is going to be sine x dw is going to be e to the 2 x dx so if u is equal to x d u is going to be the derivative of x which is 1 times dx which we can simply write as dx v is equal to sine x the derivative of sine x is cosine x so dv is going to be cosine x dx dw is e to the 2x dx the anti-derivative of e to the 2x is going to be e to the 2x divided by 2. the derivative of 2x is 2. so now this is going to be uvw so that's x sine x times w which is e to the 2x over 2 minus the integral of v which is sine times w which is e to the 2x over 2 times dv which is dx minus the integral of u which is x times w times dv dv is cosine x dx so we have a lot of integrals to deal with here but what we're going to do now is we're going to focus on this integral that we see here so that is one half the integral i took the two and move it to the front so there's the one half symbol one half the integral x e to the two x cosine x dx now we need to use this formula again so we're going to make u equal to x so d u is dx again and let me rewrite it i'm going to write it as x cosine x e to the 2x so v is going to be cosine the derivative of cosine is negative sign and then dw is e to the 2x dx so w is going to be the same thing e to the 2x divided by 2. so now let's put it together so we have uvw that's x cosine x e to the two x over two minus the integral of v w d u v is cosine w is e to the two x over two and d u is d x and then minus the integral of u w d v u is x w is e to the two x over two and dv is negative sine x dx so notice that this expression is similar to the original one so therefore we can combine those two integrals later so we just need to worry about this one but now let's move on and deal with this integral it's a two product term expression so we're going to have one half the integral of sine x e to the 2x so we're going to use this formula the integral of u dv is equal to uv minus the integral of vdu so u is going to be sine x d u is going to be the derivative of sine which is cosine x dx dv is going to be e to the 2 x dx and so v is e to the 2 x over 2. so this becomes u times v so that's one half sine x e to the two x minus the integral of v to u so that's e to the two x over two times d u which is cosine x dx so notice that eventually we're going to be able to combine these two expressions so at this point what we want to do right now is take these terms and plug it in to their respective formulas now one thing that we have yet to do is distribute the one half so let's go ahead and do that now so multiplying everything by a half this becomes one-fourth and this becomes e to the two x over four now we need to do the same with this expression so let's replace all the twos with a four so this would equate to dividing every term by 2 or multiplying it by a half so now the original expression x sine x e to the 2x dx is going to equal this so that's one half x sine x e to the 2x and then minus now replacing this expression with what we see here it's going to be minus 1 4 sine x e to the 2x and minus minus that expression so that's going to be plus 1 4 the integral of cosine x e to the 2x and let's not forget dx so now we can move on to this one we do have a negative sign so keep that in mind so it's going to be minus so we're going to replace this with everything that we see here so it's minus that term so that's going to be 1 4 x cosine e to the 2x and then we have minus and another minus so that's going to be positive which i'm going to put right under this expression because we can add them so positive 1 4 integral cosine x e to the 2 x and then we have minus minus minus 3 negatives that's a negative so minus let's move the 4 to the front 1 4 the integral of x sine x e to the 2 x dx so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to take this and move it to the left side of the equation so we have 1 plus 1 4 that's 4 over 4 plus 1 over 4 which is 5 over 4. so 5 over 4 integral x sine x e to the two x dx is going to equal one half x sine x e to the two x minus one fourth sine x e to the two x one fourth plus one fourth is a half so plus one half integral cosine x e to the two x dx and then minus one fourth x cosine x e to the two x so now let's eliminate this and let's focus on this integral the integral of cosine x e to the 2x dx we'll deal with the one-half later so we're going to make u equal to let's put this on the bottom here let's make u equal to cosine x so d u will be negative sine x dx and dv is e to the 2x dx so v is going to be e to the 2x divided by 2. so using the formula for two product term expression it's going to be the integral of udv is uv minus the integral of vdu so u times v that's going to be one half cosine x e to the two x minus the integral of v d u so this is v this is d u that's going to be negative sine x e to the 2 x over 2 dx so the two negative signs will cancel that's going to be positive and we can move the one half to the front so this becomes plus one half the integral of sine x e to the 2x dx now we need to use integration by parts one more time so this time we need to make u equal to sine x d u is going to be cosine x dx and dv is going to be the same so this is equal to one half cosine x e to the two x plus one half and now let's apply this formula so it's uv that's going to be one half sine x e to the 2x minus the integral of v to u which is one half cosine x e to the 2x dx now let's put this all together so the integral of cosine e to the 2x dx is going to be one-half cosine x times e to the two x and then one half times one half that's going to be plus one fourth sine x e to the two x and then we have one-half times negative one-half so that's negative one-fourth integral cosine x e to the two x dx so now we can combine these two expressions so add in 1 4 integral cosine x e to the 2x this is going to be 1 plus 1 4. so we have 5 over 4 integral cosine x e to the 2 x dx which is equal to this now we're not trying to solve for 5 over 4 cosine x e to the 2x we want to find the value of just one of it so to turn this back into a 1 we need to multiply everything by 4 over 5. so the 4's cancel the 5's cancel and we're going to get our original expression four over five times one over two four over two is two so this becomes two over five cosine x e to the two x here the fours cancel so that becomes one over five sine x e to the two x so the integral of cosine x e to the two x is two over five cosine x to e to the two x plus 1 over 5 sine x e to the 2x so we need to replace this expression with what we have here and then combine like terms so 5 over 4 integral x sine x e to the 2 x dx that's going to be one half x sine x e to the 2 x minus 1 4 sine x e to the 2 x and then we have plus one half times everything here so times two over five cosine x e to the two x and then plus one half times this that's times one over five sine x e to the two x and then that one minus one fourth x cosine x e to the two x so we can combine those expressions so that is negative 1 4 plus this is 1 over 10. so getting common denominators so we need to get to 20. we're going to multiply that by 2 over 2 and this by 5 over 5. so we get negative 5 over 20. plus 2 over 20 which becomes negative 3 over 20. in case you're wondering why the screen looks a little different there's no cause for concern i just had to do some video editing so let's put everything together at this point so these expressions combined we said it's negative 3 over twenty sine x e to the two x and then these will cancel so we're gonna get plus one over five cosine x e to the two x and then minus one fourth x cosine x e to the two x now we need to replace the five over four with a one so we're going to multiply every expression by four over five so the fours will cancel the fives will cancel on the left we're going to get the integral of x sine x e to the two x these will cancel four divided by two is two so this will give us two over five x sine x e to the two x three over twenty times four over five that requires some work twenty can be written as four over five and so we can cancel the 4 which will give us 3 over 25 and then we can multiply these two four over five times one over five that's going to be four over 25 cosine x e to the two x and then these will cancel giving us negative one over five x cosine x e to the two x plus c so thus we have our final answer which i'm gonna write on the top of the screen because we're going to check our work soon so the integral of x sine x e to the 2 x dx is equal to 2 over 5 x sine x e to the 2x and then minus 3 over 25 sine x e to the 2x minus 1 over 5 x cosine x e to the 2 x and then plus 4 over 25 cosine x e to the 2 x plus c so this is the final answer so that's how you could find the indefinite integral of a three product term expression using integration by parts now in order to make sure that this answer is indeed correct we're going to take the derivative of the right side of the equation and make sure we get what is on the left side so let's take the derivative of the first term 2 over five x sine x e to the two x so we're going to use the product rule given this three term expression first we're gonna differentiate the first part two over five x the derivative of x is one so it's two over five times one and then we're just going to multiply by the other two products sine x e to the two x next we're going to leave the first part the same we're going to take the derivative of the second part the derivative of sine is cosine and we're going to leave the third part the same for the last one we're going to differentiate the third part which is e to the 2x times two leaving these two the same so two times this will be four over five x sine x and then e to the 2x now let's take the derivative of the next term that is of negative 3 over 25 sine x e to the 2x so we need to use the product rule again but for a two product term expression let's say this is u this is v so the derivative of the first part is going to be negative 3 over 25 times the derivative of sine which is cosine and we're going to leave the second part the same next we need to differentiate this part e to the 2x which is just e to the two x times two so negative three over twenty five times two that's gonna be negative six over twenty five sine x e to the two x now moving on to the next term the next one is going to be negative one over five x cosine x e to the two x so we have a three product term expression the derivative of negative one over five x is just negative one over five and then we're gonna have cosine times e to the two x the derivative of cosine is negative sine so this is going to be positive one over five x sine x e to the two x and the derivative of e to the two x is the same thing times two so it's gonna be negative two over five x cosine x e to the 2x now for the last one 4 over 25 cosine x e to the 2x we have a two product term expression the derivative of cosine is negative sign so we're going to have negative 4 over 25 sine x e to the 2x and then the derivative of e to the 2x is going to be that times 2 so 4 times 2 that would be 8 over 25 cosine x e to the 2x so what we're going to do is add these terms and see if we get this so let's think about what cancels so these two terms cancel let's see what else let's focus on d stream negative 3 over 25 negative one over five if you multiply that by five over five you get negative five over twenty five plus eight over twenty five that adds to zero so therefore we can cancel these three terms now let's talk about these numbers here two over five multiplying that by 5 over 5 that's going to give us 10 over 25 and then we have minus 6 over 25 minus 4 over 25 that's going to give us 0 as well so we could cancel these those three terms so what we have left over is the sum of these two four over five plus one over five is five over five which is just one so we get one x sine x e to the two x which is our original expression so therefore this is indeed the correct answer so that is the integral or the antiderivative of x sine x e to the 2x so now you know how to apply the integration by parts formula when you're dealing with a three product term expression so that's it for this video thanks again

Transcript for: Trigonometric Integrals
in this video we're going to focus on trigonometric integrals but now to begin you may want to write down some notes just to review some formulas that will be useful when integrating trigonometric expressions first sine squared plus cosine squared we need to know that equals one next one plus tangent squared is equal to secant squared this is a good review of some trigonometric formulas that you've been exposed to in the past the next one you need to be familiar with is one plus cotangent squared is equal to cosecant squared next we have the double angle formulas sine two x is equal to two sine x cosine x and then cosine two x there's three forms that you can convert this into you can convert it to cosine squared minus sine squared you could set it equal to one minus two sine squared or two cosine squared minus one next up are the power reducing formulas sine squared can be reduced to one half one minus cosine two x and cosine squared you can reduce that to one half one plus cosine 2x now there are some other trigonometric formulas that you may need to know which i'll introduce later in this video when it becomes relevant but for now we can work with what we have here now the first problem that we're going to work on is this one let's find the anti-derivative of cosine to the third x so what do you think we need to do here what we could do is we can write cosine cube as cosine squared times cosine x and what we want to do is we want to change cosine squared into one minus sine squared keep in mind sine squared plus cosine squared is equal to one solving for cosine we can move sine squared to the other side if we do that we'll get that cosine squared is one minus sine squared so we're going to replace cosine squared with one minus sine squared now the reason why we want to put it in this form is so that we can do u substitution if we make u equal to sine x d u is going to be cosine x and dx so that's why we have to keep at least one cosine on the outside so that we can use it to change it into d u so this part here is d u and we're going to replace sine with u so this becomes the integral of one minus u squared d u the antiderivative of one is going to be u the antiderivative of u squared is u to the third over three and then plus c now our last step is to replace u with sine so our final answer is going to be sine x minus 1 over 3 sine to the third x plus c so that's the antiderivative of cosine cubed now let's work on another similar problem but one that's a little bit harder cosine raised to the fifth of x go ahead and find the anti-derivative of that expression so what we're going to do is we're going to take out a cosine so this is going to be cosine to the fourth times cosine x dx now we want this to become eventually du like we did before so we need to change cosine into sine but we need to get cosine squared first cosine to the fourth is cosine squared squared now cosine squared we can make that one minus sine squared now at this point we can replace sine with u d u is going to be cosine x and dx so we're going to replace this with d u so this becomes the integral of one minus u squared raised to the second power and all of this can be replaced with d u now before we can integrate this expression we need to expand it so what we have is one minus u squared times one minus u squared so let's foil one times one and that's going to be 1 and then this is negative u squared plus another negative u squared so that's going to be negative 2 u squared and then negative u squared times negative u squared that's gonna be positive u to the fourth and then times du so now let's go ahead and find the antiderivative of this expression so it's going to be u minus two u to the third over three plus u to the fifth power over five using the power rule and then plus the constant of integration so now we can write our final answer let's replace u with sine so we're gonna have sine x minus two over three sine to the third power of x and then plus one over five sine to the fifth power of x plus c so this is the indefinite integral of cosine x raised to the fifth power so this is our final answer now let's try another problem let's find the indefinite integral of cosine to the fifth x times sine x dx feel free to try this problem so what should we do here notice that we have a sine by itself so what we want to do is we want to make u equal to cosine because d u is going to have the sign that we need to cancel this sign the derivative of cosine is negative sine and if we solve for dx it's going to be d u divided by negative sine so we can go ahead and replace cosine with u so this would be u to the fifth power and then we could replace dx with what we have here d u over negative sine x sine will cancel so we're going to have the integral of negative u to the fifth d u and then using the power rule it's going to be negative u to the 6 over 6 and then plus c so now we just got to replace u with cosine and so our final answer is going to be negative one over six cosine to the sixth power of x plus c so this is the answer this problem wasn't too bad it was pretty straightforward now let's try a similar problem that is going to be a little bit longer than the other one so let's find the indefinite integral of sine to the fifth power times cosine squared of x dx feel free to pause the video if you want to now the question is should we make u equal to sine or cosine cosine has an even power sine has an odd power what we want to do is we want to make u equal to cosine because what we could do is take out a sine leave it by itself and then the sine to the fourth we can convert all of that into cosine so let me show you sine to the fifth we're going to write that as sine to the fourth x times sine times cosine squared this sign we want that to pair up with the dx because that's going to be our du everything else we want it to be not in terms of sine but cosine sine to the fourth i'm going to write that as sine squared squared and then we have cosine squared and i'm going to put sine next to dx now we know that sine squared is one minus cosine squared based on the trig identity sine squared plus cosine squared is one and now we have everything in terms of cosine except this particular trig function sine so now we can make u equal to cosine d u is going to be negative sine x dx so dx is this so everywhere we see a cosine we're going to replace it with u so this is going to be 1 minus u squared squared times u squared times sine x and then let's replace dx with d u over negative sine x so these will cancel and what we need to do next is we need to foil so this is what we have at this point and let's not forget the negative sign that we have here so i'm going to put that in the front now we've already foiled 1 minus u squared times 1 minus u squared based on a previous problem we know it's going to be 1 minus 2u squared plus u to the fourth our next step is to distribute u squared so u squared times one that's going to be u squared but let's go ahead and distribute this negative sign as well so it's going to be negative u squared and then u squared times negative 2 u squared times the negative sign that's going to be positive 2 u to the fourth and then u squared times u to the fourth with the negative in front that's going to be negative u to the sixth so now let's go ahead and find the antiderivative of each of these terms so it's gonna be negative u to the third over three plus two u to the fifth over five minus u to the seventh over seven plus c so now let's go ahead and replace u with cosine so it's going to be negative one over three cosine to the third power plus two over five cosine to the fifth power minus one over seven cosine to the seventh power plus c so this right here is going to be our final answer so that is the antiderivative of sine to the fifth x times cosine squared x here's another similar problem let's find the indefinite integral of sine to the fifth power of x times cosine cube x try that one now we got to decide if we want to make u equal to sine or cosine because we can isolate a sine from the integral we can split that into sine to the fourth times sine or we could split this into cosine squared times cosine i think it's easier if we split cosine cubed into cosine squared times cosine and then convert the cosine squared into one minus sine squared leaving that last cosine to be with dx let's do it that way because to change this to sine to the fourth times sine and then to convert sine to the fourth into sine squared times sine squared that's gonna be more work if we focus on this one if we split it apart and since it's easier to deal with three than five we don't have to foil so it's easier if we break up cosine cubed into cosine squared and cosine now all we need to do is change cosine squared into one minus sine squared so now we have everything in terms of sine except one cosine function so now let's go ahead and make u equal to sine x and d u will simply be cosine x dx so this is going to be u to the fifth and then times 1 minus u squared and then cosine x dx we could simply replace that with du now let's distribute the u to the fifth to one minus two squared so it's going to be u to the five minus u to the seven and then d u the anti-derivative of u to the five is going to be u to the six over six and then for u to the seventh that becomes u to the eight over eight plus c now let's replace u with sine x so the final answer is going to be one over six sine to the sixth power of x minus one over eight sine to the eighth x plus c so this is the indefinite integral of the original problem now the next problem that we need to work on is finding the indefinite integral of sine squared x now this problem is definitely different from what we've been doing before so what do you recommend that we should do here because it's not really advantageous to convert this into one minus cosine squared in this case we need to use the power reducing formulas if you recall earlier at the beginning of the video we wrote that sine squared is one half times one minus cosine two x so what we could do is move the one half to the front and focus on what we have here the anti-derivative of one is going to be let's put this in parentheses x now the antiderivative of cosine 2x the antiderivative of cosine is sine but for negative cosine it's going to be negative sine 2x but we need to divide it by the derivative of the inside the derivative of 2x is 2. so we've got to divide this by 2. so that's the antiderivative of negative cosine 2x it's negative sine 2x divided by 2. now all we need to do at this point is distribute the one-half we could leave our answer like this if we want to but let's go ahead and distribute the one half so it's going to be one half x minus 1 4 sine 2x plus c so this is the antiderivative of sine squared using a double angle now keep in mind we can always replace sine 2x with 2 sine x cosine x using the double angle formula but let's go ahead and move on to the next problem let's find the antiderivative of instead of cosine squared let's make this cosine squared of 3x so go ahead and try that so first we need to talk about the power reducing formula of cosine squared cosine squared x is one half one plus cosine two x so notice the angle it went from x to 2x it doubled what we have here is cosine squared 3x so using the power reducing formula the angle is going to double it's going to go from 3x to 6x so this is going to be one half times 1 plus cosine 6x so we're going to have one half integral 1 plus cosine 6x and then dx so now we can find the antiderivative the antiderivative of 1 is going to be x and the anti-derivative of cosine 6x that's going to be sine 6x divided by the derivative of 6x which is 6 and of course plus c so now the last thing that we need to do is distribute the one half so we're gonna have one half x plus one over twelve sine six x plus c this right here is the final answer now for the next problem we're going to try finding the indefinite integral of sine to the fourth x dx so go ahead and try that problem so this is the integral of sine squared x and that is going to be squared as well sine squared raised to the second power is the same as sine to the fourth and now we could use the power reducing formula on sine squared so it's going to be a half times 1 and then not plus but minus cosine 2x and then all raised to the second power now we're going to distribute the exponent so if we distribute to one-half it's going to be one-half squared so that becomes one-fourth and then we're gonna have 1 minus cosine 2x raised to the second power which means we need to foil that now we can move the 1 4 to the front so we have 1 over 4 integral 1 minus cosine 2x times 1 minus cosine 2x dx so first we have one times one which is one and then this is going to be negative cosine 2x plus another negative cosine 2x that's negative 2 cosine 2x and then negative cosine 2x times negative cosine 2x that's positive cosine squared of 2x now before we integrate this expression let's use the power reducing formula on cosine square 2x so we know cosine squared of 1x is one-half 1 plus cosine 2x so therefore cosine squared of 2x is going to be one half one plus cosine four x so the key here is to realize that when you're using the power of reducing formula the angle doubles so if it doubles from 1x to 2x then if we start from 2x it's going to double to 4x so this becomes 1 4 integral one minus two cosine two x and then plus one half well let's distribute the half so this is one half times one or just one half and then this is going to be plus one half cosine four x now what we could do is combine like terms one plus one half one is two over two so plus one over two that becomes three over two so we can just put 3 over 2 here and now let's find the anti-derivative so the anti-derivative of negative 2 cosine 2x that's going to be negative 2. the antiderivative of cosine is negative sine i mean not negative sine but positive sine 2x divided by 2. the antiderivative of 3 over 2 is just 3 over 2 times x and for cosine to the 4x is going to be sine to the 4x over 4. and then of course plus c now let's organize our answer so i'm going to keep the one-fourth in the front i'm going to write this one first so plus or just three over two x now these twos will cancel so we're just going to have minus sine 2x and this is going to be 1 over 8 sine 4x and then plus the constant of integration so this is the antiderivative of sine to the fourth x now let's try this problem what is the anti-derivative of sine squared cosine squared dx go ahead and try that so for this problem we need to use the power reducing formulas on sine squared and cosine squared so sine squared is one half times one minus cosine two x cosine squared is one half but one plus cosine two x one half times one half is one over four so we can move that to the front and then we need to foil so here we have one times one so that's going to be one and then positive cosine two x will cancel with negative cosine two x so the two middle terms cancel and then negative cosine times positive cosine is going to give us negative cosine squared of 2x 1 minus cosine squared that's an identity one minus cosine squared is equal to sine squared so we now have is one fourth integral sine squared 2x dx now if sine squared 1x is this sine squared 2x must be the same thing but with a 4x here instead of a 2x so we now have is 1 4 integral and then using the power reducing formula this is going to be one half times 1 minus cosine but not 2x this is going to double the 4x now one-fourth and one-half we can combine so it's one over eight integral 1 minus cosine 4x dx the antiderivative of 1 is x the antiderivative of cosine is going to be sine but 4x divided by the derivative of 4x which is 4. and then plus c so this is the final answer to the problem for the next problem we're going to find the indefinite integral of cosine squared times tangent to the third power so what do you think we need to do here in order to find the indefinite integral of this expression well we don't know of an identity that involves cosine and tangent so the best thing to do is to convert tangent into sine over cosine so tangent cube is going to be sine to the third divided by cosine cubed or we could write cosine cube as cosine squared times cosine so that way we can easily cancel out a cosine squared now if we try to make u equal to sine d u is going to be cosine dx but the cosine is on the bottom not on the top so it's not going to cancel well the way it is so we want to make u equal to sine i mean u equal to cosine that sine so we're going to do is we're going to split up sine cube into sine squared times sine and we'll leave cosine on the bottom for now now in the next step we're going to change sine squared into 1 minus cosine squared now at this point we can make u equal to cosine x d u is going to be negative sine x dx and so dx is going to be d u over negative sine x so this becomes 1 minus u squared divided by u and then we have sine x times d u over negative sine so we can cross that out and then let's move the negative sign to the front so we have negative integral let's break this up into two smaller fractions so it's going to be 1 over u and then minus u squared over u which is negative u so this is going to equal negative lnu and then these two negative signs they'll cancel so that's going to be positive and the anti-derivative of u is going to be u squared over two plus c so this is going to be negative ln and then uh absolute value cosine x plus one half cosine squared x plus c so this is the final answer to uh the problem at hand that's it that's all we got to do here you

in this video I'm going to give you a list of integration formulas for common trig functions so let's begin the indefinite integral of sin x is cine X and you don't want to forget plus C and the indefinite integral of cosine X DX is going to be positive sinx plus C now sometimes you might see these trig functions in this format the indefinite integral of sin x I mean of sin ax + B it's going to be negative cosine the angle ax plus b will be the same but then it's divided by the derivative of ax plus b which is a plus c now it works the same way for cosine so the indefinite integral of cosine ax + b you could write it this way instead of just putting over a you could write 1/ a s a x + B plus C now this also works for the other trig functions like secant cosecant tangent cotangent if you have a linear function on the inside you just have to divide your answer by a and this is ax to the first Power Plus B now the indefinite integral of tangent X it's the natural log of secant x plus C now secant is the reciprocal of cosine secant x is 1/ cosine so this is Ln cine x + C if you move the ne 1 to the front you get cosine x^ 1 which is 1 / cosine which is secant so that's why we have the negative sign there now the anti-derivative or the indefinite integral of coent x DX is going to be the natural log of sinx + C alternatively you could set it equal to the natural log of negative natural log of cosecant X plus C so that's the indefinite integral for tangent and coent now the indefinite integral of secant x DX is going to be the natural log secant X+ tangent x + C the indefinite integral for cosecant X is very similar we're going to have a natural log function but instead of secant it's going to be cosecant and instead of plus we have minus instead of tangent we have cotangent now the indefinite integral of not s but sin^2 X this is going to be 12 x -4 sin 2x now for those of you who don't remember the double angle formulas sin 2x is 2 sinx cosine X I'm going to put the trig formula sheet in the description section below for those of you who need to review the trig formulas so we can write this as 12 x - sin x cine X that's another way to represent the answer and the indefinite integral of cine 2 x DX is very similar 12 x but instead of minus it's going to be 12x +/ 14x sin 2x+ C very similar to sin squ the only difference is instead of a minus you have a plus so we can also write it as 12 X+ sin x cine X plus C by the way if you want a list of these integration formulas feel free to check out the formula sheet below I have two formula sheets the trig formula sheet and the integration formulas uh that sheet sheet as well so feel free to download both of them if you want this cuz there's a lot of other integration formulas out there that you'll find useful for those of you who are studying integration at this time now let's move on to tangent squar the indefinite integral of tan squar is tangent x - x plus C likewise the indefinite integral of coent squ it's going to be not positive but negative Cent x - x + C the indefinite integral of secant squ is tangent x + C and the indefinite integral of cosecant squ is negative Cent x + C because the derivative of tangent is secant squ and the derivative of coent is negative cosecant squ so the integral of cosecant Square will be negative cotangent now there are some other trig formulas that you want to be familiar with this is called the reduction formulas in case you have higher Powers than two so the integral of sin n x DX is going to be -1 /n sin n -1 x cine X and then plus n -1 / n integral sin N - 2 X DX now you may need to know the integration by parts formula so if you're multiplying if you have two products it's integral UV which is UV minus integral VD for three products I have a formula for that in the form sheet now the reduction formula for cosine is this cosine n x DX is going to be 1 / n cosine n -1 x sin x + n -1 over an integral cosine N - 2 X DX now there's another one the integral of Tan N X DX it's going to be 1/ nus1 tangent nus1 of X and then minus the integral of tangent nus 2 X DX and N cannot equal 1 now there's some other reduction formulas for secant cosecant and coent but I'm going to put that in the formula sheet which you could find below so those are some common integration formulas for trick functions that uh you may encounter so feel free to take a look at that formula sheet when you get a chance and thanks again for watching 

Transcript for: Reduction Formulas For Integration
how can we find the indefinite integral of sine squared of x dx using the reduction formula for sine now here's the formula that you need to use the integral of sine raised to the n of x dx it's negative one over n cosine x sine to the n minus one power of x plus n minus 1 over n times the integral of sine raised to the n minus 2 power of x dx so in this problem we can see that n is equal to two so using the formula it's going to be negative one over n or negative one over two cosine x sine n minus one or two minus one which is one so we could simply say sine x plus n minus one over n so that's two minus one over two which is one over two integral sine n minus two so two minus two is zero anything raised to the zero power is one so this becomes one dx now the integral of one dx is simply x so we get this answer this is going to be one half x plus c now you can leave your answer like this or you can adjust it if you wish to adjust that you need to be familiar with the double angle formula for sine sine two x is two sine x cosine x so if we divide by two one half sine x i mean one half sine two x is sine x times cosine x so what we're gonna do is we're gonna replace sine x cosine x with a half sine two x so this is gonna be negative one-half times one-half sine 2x plus half of x plus c and so i'm going to write the final answer like this so it's going to be one half x and then a half times a half is one fourth but there's a negative sign in front of it so it's negative one fourth sine two x plus c so this is the anti-derivative of sine squared x you can write your answer like that or you could write it like this if you want to let's try another example what is the antiderivative of cosine cubed of x dx using the reduction formula for cosine so let's start with the formula cosine raised to the n of x dx is equal to 1 over n cosine to the n minus 1 of x times sine x plus n minus 1 over n integral cosine n minus 2 of x dx so in this problem n is equal to 3. so this is going to equal one over n or one over three cosine n minus one three minus one is two and then times sine x and then we have n minus one over n so three minus one over three that's going to be two over three integral cosine and minus two three minus two is one and so we have one third now i'm going to replace cosine squared with 1 minus sine squared i'll do that later but for now we have cosine squared times sine x and the integral of cosine is sine so if you want to you can leave your answer like this but what i'm going to do is i'm going to adjust it i'm going to replace cosine squared with 1 minus sine squared and then i'm going to distribute 1 3 sine x to 1 minus sine squared so it's going to be 1 3 times 1 times sine x so that's simply 1 3 sine x and then it's one-third times negative sine squared times sine x which is negative one-third sine to the third power of x and then we have everything else so now let's combine like terms we can combine these two and one over three plus two over three is three over three and three divided by three is one so the final answer is going to be sine x minus one third sine cubed x plus c and so this is the indefinite integral of cosine cube x dx so you can leave your answer like this or you can write it in this form if you want to now let's try one more problem let's integrate sine to the fourth x dx using the reduction formula for sine so first let's rewrite the formula this is what we had at the beginning it was negative 1 over n cosine and then times sine n minus 1 plus n minus 1 over n integral sine n minus 2 x dx so we can clearly see that n is 4 in this problem so it's going to be negative 1 over n or negative 1 over 4 cosine x and then sine n minus 1 or 4 minus 1 which is three and then n minus one that's four minus one again that's three over n which is four integral sine n minus two so four minus two is two so right now we have negative one over four cosine x sine cube x plus three over four and earlier in this video we said that the integral of sine squared was one half x minus one fourth sine two x and of course plus c so let's distribute the three-fourths to everything inside here so it's negative one-fourth cosine x sine cubed and then three over four times one over two that's gonna be three over eight and then three-fourths times one-fourth that's three over sixteen sine two x plus c so this is the answer if you want to leave it in that form now i'm going to adjust the answer i'm going to simplify it using the double angle formula for sine so recall that we said that sine x cosine x is one half sine two x so i'm going to rewrite sine cube as sine x times sine squared and everything else i'm just gonna keep it the same for now now let's replace sine cosine with one half sine x so i have negative one fourth times one half sine two x and then i'm going to replace sine squared with something i'm going to use the double angle formula for cosine or you could say the power reducing formula for sine squared so you need to know that sine squared is equal to one half and then it's one minus cosine two x so that's the power reducing formula for sine squared and then everything else will be the same so now i have a 4 times a 2 times a 2. four times two is eight times two is sixteen so this is negative one over sixteen and then sine two x times one minus cosine two x and then everything else now i need to distribute negative 1 over 16 sine 2x to 1 minus cosine 2x so when we multiply it by 1 it's just going to be negative 1 over 16 sine 2x and then if we multiply it by negative cosine x is going to be positive 1 over 16 sine 2x cosine 2x now let's combine like terms negative 1 over 16 minus 3 over 16 that's going to be negative 4 over 16 sine 2x now earlier we said that sine x cosine x is one half sine two x so therefore sine two x cosine two x must be one half sine four x so if we double x to two x then two x has to be double to four x so let's replace sine two x cosine 2x with half of sine 4x now let's put this in order so we have 3 over 8 x and then 4 over 16 we can reduce that to negative 1 over 4 sine 2x and then 1 over 16 times 1 over 2 that's 1 over 32 sine 4x and then plus c so this is another way in which you could represent the answer so this is the integral of sine to the fourth x you 

Transcript for: Integral of sinx cosx
in this video we're going to focus on finding the integral of sine x cosine x now there's three ways in which we can get the answer the first technique involves u substitution and we're going to replace u with sine x d u the derivative of sine is going to be cosine x dx and so let's substitute sine with the u variable and let's replace cosine x dx with du so this becomes the integral of u d u using the power rule this is going to be u to the second power divided by 2 plus some constant c and then now we need to replace you with sine x so the answer is going to be one half sine squared x plus c so this is just one of the three ways in which we can represent the answer now here's the second way so let's start back with the original problem but instead of making u equal to sine let's make u equal to cosine x d u is going to be the derivative of cosine which is negative sine x dx now in this example i'm going to solve for dx it's d u divided by sine so let's replace cosine with u and let's replace the dx with du divided by negative sine x so we're going to have the integral of sine x times the u variable times d u over negative sine so we could cancel sine and so we have negative integral u to the first d u which is going to be u squared over two plus c and this time u is cosine so this is going to be negative one half cosine squared plus c and so this is the second way to represent the answer now let's focus on the third method of getting this answer it has to do with the double angle formula of sine 2x now sine 2x is equal to two sine x cosine x so if we multiply both sides by a half we're gonna have one half sine two x on the left side and on the right side two times a half is one so it's just going to be sine x cosine x on the right side so therefore what we're going to do is replace sine x cosine x with this expression so now we have the integral of one half sine two x dx now i'm going to move the constant to the front now what is the antiderivative of sine 2x the antiderivative of sine is negative cosine the angle will stay the same 2x and then we need to divide it by the derivative of the angle which is 2. and then plus c so the answer that we have is negative one fourth cosine two x plus c so the three answers that we got for the integral of sine x cosine x was this one that we just got and then the first one was one half sine squared x plus c and the second one was negative one half cosine squared plus c now the reason why we have these three answers is because there's multiple forms of the double angle formula for cosine 2x i'm going to focus on two of the three forms cosine two x is equal to one minus two sine squared x and it's also equal to 2 cosine squared x minus 1. the third form is cosine squared minus sine squared so starting with this expression let's replace cosine 2x with this expression so it was negative 1 4 and then instead of writing cosine 2x i'm going to insert 1 minus 2 sine squared and let's not forget about the constant plus c so this is going to be negative one fourth and then if we multiply negative 1 4 by negative 2 sine squared it's going to be positive one half sine squared plus c now when you add negative 1 4 plus some unknown constant combined you could just write it as a single constant so we can replace negative 1 4 plus c with just c so that would be just a generic constant and you can see that you get the same expression now let's replace cosine 2x with cosine squared x times 2 minus 1. so instead of writing negative 1 4 cosine 2x let's replace the cosine 2x with this and then we have a plus c on the outside so negative 1 4 times 2 that's going to be negative 1 over 2 cosine squared x and then negative 1 4 times negative 1 that's positive 1 4 and then plus the constant c so 1 4 plus a constant is equal to another constant which we can just replace with some generic constant just like we did before and that will give us the same expression so as you can see you can write the integral of sine x cosine x in any one of these three forms because you can convert one form into another using the double angle formulas for cosine you 

Transcript for: Trigonometric Substitution
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the indefinite integral using trigonometric substitution now there's three forms that you need to be familiar with the first one is the square root of a squared minus x squared the second one you want to look for is a squared plus x squared inside a square root function and the last one the square root of x squared minus a squared now for the first one you need to substitute x with a sine theta where a is a constant and the reason for that is because 1 minus sine squared is cosine squared for the second one replace x with a tangent theta and the reason for that is 1 plus tan squared is secant squared and for the last one replace x with a secant theta because one secant squared minus one is tangent squared now these are the three forms that you need to look out for when using trigonometric substitution so let's work on an example problem let's say if we have the square root of four minus x squared divided by x squared how can we integrate this function so notice that we have the form square root a squared minus x squared so we can clearly see that a squared is 4 which means that a is equal to the square root of 4 or 2. therefore we need to replace x with a sine theta in this case x has to be 2 sine theta so dx is going to be the derivative of 2 sine theta so that's 2 cosine theta d theta and so now we're going to have the integral of 4 minus let's replace x with 2 sine theta so this is going to be 2 sine theta squared and then divided by x squared which is also 2 sine theta squared now let's replace dx with 2 cosine theta d theta we can get rid of this for now so now we got to do some math so let's perform some algebra techniques to simplify this expression 2 squared is 4 so 2 sine squared is going to be 4 sine squared theta and on the bottom we're also going to have 4 sine squared theta now what do you think we need to do at this point at this point we need to take out a 4 inside the square root so we can get 1 minus sine squared so we're going to have the square root of 4 times 1 minus sine squared theta now something else that we can do is that we can cancel two two over four reduces to one over two so there's gonna be a two left over on the bottom and we still have cosine theta d theta now we can take the square root of four the square root of four is two and then we can replace one minus sine squared with cosine squared so the cosine squared part is still inside the square root symbol so now at this point we can cancel two two divided by two is one and the square root of cosine squared is cosine theta so we have cosine and this is supposed to be sine squared cosine over sine squared times cosine theta d theta and cosine times cosine is cosine squared now what do you think we should do at this point the best thing i recommend doing at this point is to replace cosine squared with one minus sine squared because sine squared plus cosine squared is one now at this point we can split the fraction into two fractions so we could divide one by sine squared and we can divide sine squared by itself now you need to be familiar with the reciprocal identities intrigue one over sine is cosecant so one over sine squared is cosecant squared and sine squared divided by sine squared is one so this is what we now have now what is the antiderivative of cosecant squared the derivative of cotangent is a negative cosecant squared so the antiderivative of negative cosecant squared is cotangent so the antiderivative of positive cosecant squared is negative cotangent and the anti-derivative of negative one d theta is going to be negative theta and then plus c now this is the answer it's the integral but not with the appropriate variables because we started with an x variable and now we have to change theta back into an x variable so how can we do that now recall we said that x is equal to two sine theta so if we divide both sides by two sine theta is x over two so we can make a right triangle now you need to be familiar with the principles of sohcahtoa the soul part of sokatoa tells us that sine theta is equal to the opposite side divided by the adjacent side so let's place the angle theta here so opposite to theta is x that's on top divided by the hypotenuse so the hypotenuse is 2. now we've got to find the missing side so whenever you have a right triangle you can use the pythagorean theorem c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared c is the hypotenuse which is two we could say a is x and b is the missing side that we're looking for so two squared is 4 and if we subtract both sides by x squared we're going to have 4 minus x squared is equal to b squared so the missing side b is going to be 4 the square root of 4 minus x squared so we can put that here now if sine theta is x divided by 2 what is tangent theta based on sohcahtoa tangent is opposite over adjacent this is opposite this is adjacent so tangent will be x over the square root of four minus x squared cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent it's 1 over tangent so if tangent is x divided by the square root of 4 minus x squared cotangent is going to be the reciprocal of that fraction so it's going to be the square root of 4 minus x squared over x so now what about theta what can we replace theta with now recall that sine theta is x divided by 2. so if we take the arc sine of both sides what's going to happen what is the arc sine of sine theta well these two expressions will cancel and so we can say that theta is the arc sine of x over two so we have negative theta so it's going to be negative arc sine x divided by 2 and then plus c so this is the final answer so that's how you can find the indefinite integral using trig substitution now let's work on finding the integral of x cubed divided by the square root of x squared plus nine so we have the form x squared plus a squared or you can write it as a squared plus x squared five plus three and three plus five is the same so what should we replace x with if we see this particular form in this case we need to use the expression x is equal to a tangent theta so a squared is the same as a 9. if a squared is equal to 9 that means a is equal to 3 which means we should replace x with 3 tangent theta so let's go ahead and do that now let's calculate dx the derivative of tangent is secant squared so dx is going to be 3 secant squared theta d theta so on top we can replace x cubed with three tangent theta raised to the third power and then x squared is going to be three tangent theta squared plus nine and so dx is three secant squared theta d theta now three to the third power is 27 so on top we have 27 tangent cube and on the bottom 3 squared is 9 so we're going to have the square root of 9 tangent squared theta plus 9. and then we still have three secant squared theta d theta now in the denominator inside the square root let's take out a 9 so we're going to have the square root of 9 and then after we factor out the gcf we're going to be left over with tangent squared plus 1. now everything else i'm just going to leave it the way it is for now now if you recall one plus tangent squared is secant squared and the square root of nine is three so we now have this expression so now at this point we can cancel three and the square root of secant squared is secant so this is what we now have 27 tangent cube times secant squared theta d theta divided by secant so now at this point we could cancel a secant and so now we're left with the integral of 27 tangent cube secant theta so what can we do to integrate this expression what we have here is a trigonometric integral and instead of writing tangent cube i'm going to replace it with tangent theta times actually tangent squared theta times tangent theta let's write it like that now we need to perform another substitution particularly u substitution at this point so i'm going to make u equal to tangent theta and the reason why i want to do that is so that d u will be actually no that's not gonna work d u will be secant squared i need to change it up a bit let's replace tan squared with secant squared minus one because one plus tangent squared is secant squared now in this format we can replace u with secant theta so that d u the derivative of secant will be secant tangent so it's going to be secant tangent theta d theta so i can replace secant with u so let me get rid of this first and so now this is going to be 27 integral of u squared minus 1 and then tangent secant d theta is the same as d u so this becomes d u you can see that here these two expressions are exactly the same now the antiderivative of u squared that's going to be u to the third power divided by three and the antiderivative of one is simply u and keep in mind we said u is equal to secant so we now have is 27 times secant to the third power divided by three minus secant theta and let's not forget plus c so we could simplify that 27 divided by three is nine so we have nine secant to the third power and then if we distribute the 27 that's going to be minus 27 times secant theta plus c now the last thing we need to do is convert that expression replace theta with x somehow now the first substitution that we made was that x is equal to three tangent theta dividing both sides by three x over three is tangent so now we can make our right triangle so this is going to be theta and here's the right angle now based on sohcahtoa tangent is opposite over adjacent so opposite to theta is x and adjacent to it right next to its stream so now we got to find the missing side so using the pythagorean theorem c squared is a squared plus b squared we could say a is stream b is x so c squared is going to be 9 plus x squared and to solve for c we got to take the square root of both sides so the third side of the triangle is the square root of nine plus x squared so now we can evaluate secant theta using the triangle but let's evaluate cosine the reciprocal of secant now based on sohcahtoa cosine theta is adjacent over hypotenuse adjacent stream so it's going to be 3 over the square root of 9 plus x squared so secant theta which is 1 divided by cosine is the reciprocal of this fraction that's going to be the square root of 9 plus x squared over 3. so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to take out 9 secant theta i'm going to factor out that expression so it's 9 secant theta times secant squared minus 3 plus c now let's replace secant with the square root of 9 plus x squared over three so secant squared we're gonna have to square this expression and then that's gonna be minus three plus c so all we got to do is simplify what we now have so 9 divided by 3 is 3. so we have a 3 in front and then square root 9 plus x squared now once we square the square root of nine plus x squared that will simply be nine plus x squared on the bottom we have three squared so that's going to be nine and then minus three now let's get common denominators so negative three or negative three over one i'm going to multiply the top and bottom by three and so inside the bracket i'm going to have 9 plus x squared divided by 9. actually i need to multiply top and bottom by 9 and not 3. what was i thinking so it's going to be negative 3 times 9 which is negative 27 and then 1 times 9 that's going to be 9. i want to turn this into a single fraction so have nine plus x squared minus 27 divided by 9 plus c now 3 over 9 that reduces to 1 3. so i can get rid of the fraction inside the bracket so i have a 1 3 outside and then square root 9 plus x squared and then 9 minus 27 is negative 18. so i have x squared minus 18 plus c and so this is the final answer for this example you
