Transcript for: Calculus - Chain Rule - Derivatives
if you were given a problem like this on a test what would you do to find the derivative of it how would you find the derivative of the fifth power of sine of cosine raised to the fourth power of the square root of tangent of the natural log of x now because we have functions within or inside of other functions we need to use the chain rule to find the derivative of this expression so before we work on this example let's talk about how to use the chain rule so let's say we have the composite function f of g of x so g is inside of f what you need to do is take the derivative of the outside part that is of f while leaving the inside part g the same and then you're going to multiply that by the derivative of the inside function so times g prime and that's the process by which we could use the chain rule to find the derivative of composite functions now let's work on some examples to help you to see how to apply this information let's say if we want to find the derivative of x squared plus 5x raised to the fourth power if you want to pause the video and try it feel free to do so so the first thing we need to do is we need to use the power rule for instance the derivative of let's say u to the fourth is gonna be four u to the third so using the power rule on this exponent we're gonna have four times everything inside we're not going to change what's on the inside and then subtracting four by one we have three so you can think of u as the variable as the stuff inside of the function now our next step is to multiply by the derivative of what was inside the function in this case u prime so the derivative of x squared is 2x the derivative of 5x is 5. this would be the answer so that's how you could use the chain rule when dealing with composite functions you differentiate the outside part first while leaving the inside part the same and then multiply by the derivative of the inside part let's work on some more examples for the sake of practice now let's try this example go ahead and find the derivative of tangent x squared feel free to take a minute and work on that example so the first thing that we're going to do is find the derivative of the outer function that is of tangent the derivative of tangent is secant squared so what goes inside secant squared well this is going to be the angle of tangent so whatever is inside of here we're going to put it there next we need to find the derivative of the inside part of the function that is of x squared the derivative of x squared is 2x and so we could write the final answer as 2x secant squared x squared so that is the derivative of tangent x squared that's how you could find it here's another example you could try that'll prepare you for the problem ahead go ahead and find the derivative of sine tangent x cubed go ahead and work on that one so let's start with the outer function sine the derivative of sine we know is cosine now everything that is inside of sine we need to rewrite and put it inside of cosine so we need to rewrite tangent x to the third so now we're done with cosine let's move on to the next one tangent the derivative of tangent is secant squared now the angle inside of tangent is x cubed so that's going to be the same angle for secant squared since secant squared came from tangent now the last thing we need to do is find the derivative of x cubed which is 3x squared and that's the process by which we could find the derivative of these multiple composite functions start from the outside and work your way in so this is the answer for this example so based on those three examples you now know everything that you need in order to try this one so go ahead and take a minute and find the derivative of that function the first thing that i recommend doing is to rewrite the expression in a way that'll make this problem a lot easier now one thing i want to mention is that let's say if you have cosine raised to the four of x this can be rewritten as cosine x raised to the fourth power when dealing with a chain rule it's easier to work with problems in this format as opposed to this one so i'm going to adjust it accordingly so cosine to the fourth power let me highlight this in blue this is going to be cosine and then we have tangent now we have the square root of tangent which is the same as tangent raised to the one-half so i'm going to put a one-half outside of the green brackets to represent the square root symbol and then for cosine to the fourth i'm going to put an exponent of four outside of the blue brackets and then we have a 5 for outside of sine so that's how we can rewrite this expression to make the work a lot easier so we're going to do now is we're going to take the 5 move it to the front we're going to find the derivative of the outer part of the function so this was u to the fifth power will be 5 times u to the fourth power so it's going to be 5 and then we're going to keep everything on the inside the same so we have sine cosine tangent of ln x raised to the one half raised to the fourth and then we're going to subtract this by one so this is going to be to the fourth so now that we've dealt with the outer part of the function let's work our way in so now we need to find the derivative of sine the derivative of sine is cosine and the angle of sine is everything that we see here so that's going to be cosine tangent ln x raised to the one-half and we still have the fourth power for cosine so now we're done with sine we need to move on to cosine now the derivative of cosine is going to be times negative sine and the angle for cosine is what we see here so that's going to be tangent lnx raised to the one half now i do need to take a step back before we can find the derivative of cosine we need to work with this exponent first so let's get rid of this so starting with this exponent moving it to the front it's going to be times 4 and then everything that is in the blue brackets so it's going to be cosine tangent ln x raised to the one one-half and then we're going to subtract this by one so that's going to be three so now we could find the derivative of cosine as we work our way in so it's going to be times the derivative of cosine is negative sine and then the angle of cosine is what we see here so that's going to be the angle of sine that's tangent ln x raised to the one-half now the next thing we need to do is move on to tangent but before we do that we need to work with the exponent so it's going to be times one half everything inside so that's tangent ln x and then one half minus one that's a negative half so now that we are through with that exponent we can work our way inside the derivative of tangent is secant squared and then the angle of tangent is ln x next we could find the derivative of ln x which is one over x so that's basically n that's how you could find the derivative of this entire expression using a chain rule so this is the answer now you could simplify it or rewrite it in a more pleasant form but i'm going to leave the answer like this so thanks for watching and don't forget to subscribe to this channel
