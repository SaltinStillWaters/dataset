Transcript for: Derivatives of Rational Functions
in this lesson we're going to talk about how to find the derivative of a rational function so let's differentiate 1 over x what is the derivative of 1 over x well first we need to rewrite the expression so this is the same as x to the minus one and now we could use the power rule and recall that the power rule the derivative of x to the n is n x raised to the n minus one so this is going to be n is negative one in this example so it's going to be negative one times x raised to the negative one minus one and negative 1 minus 1 is negative 2 and then you can rewrite it let's move the x back to the bottom so the final answer is negative 1 over x squared now let's work on another example so let's say if we want to find the derivative of one over x plus five so how is this problem different from the last one it's actually very similar so first we need to rewrite the expression i'm going to rewrite it as x plus 5 raised to the minus 1. but i'm going to use the power rule along with the chain rule so first let's use the power rule let's take the exponent and move it to the front so it's going to be negative one and then keep the inside the same and then subtract the exponent by one negative one minus one is negative two and then you're supposed to find the derivative of the inside the derivative of x plus five is one and then if we simplify it if we bring this back to the bottom the final answer is going to be negative one over x plus 5 squared now let's work on some more examples so what if we wanted to find the derivative of 1 over let's say four x minus seven try that one so following the same pattern we're differentiating four x minus seven raised to the negative one so using the chain rule and the power rule we're going to take the exponent move it to the front and then keep the inside expression 4x minus seven the same subtract the exponent by one so this is going to be negative two and then we need to find the derivative of the inside the inside function is 4x minus 7. the derivative of 4x minus 7 is 4. and so it's going to be negative 4 divided by 4x minus 7 squared and so that's the solution for that example i'm going to give you a lot of practice problems in this video so you can master this topic go ahead and find the derivative of 9 divided by x squared minus six so let's begin by rewriting the expression so this is going to be nine and let's move this to the top so 9 times x squared minus 6 raised to the minus 1. so this is going to equal 9 times the derivative of that expression so times negative 1 and then keep the inside function the same and then subtract the exponent by 1 and then multiply by the derivative of the inside function the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of any constant such as negative 6 is 0. so now we're going to multiply negative 1 by 9 which is negative 9 times 2x so that's going to be negative 18x and then this is going to go in the denominator so that's going to be x squared minus 6 and that squared so that's how we could find the derivative of that example go ahead and try this what is the derivative of 12 divided by 4 minus 8x but raised to the fourth power on the bottom go ahead and try that so as always we need to rewrite the expression so this is 12 times 4 minus 8x raised to the negative fourth power and now let's find the derivative so we're going to take the negative 4 move to the front so it's going to be 12 times negative 4 and then keep the inside function the same and then subtract the exponent by 1. negative 4 minus 1 is negative 5. and then take the derivative of the inside function the derivative of four minus eight x is negative eight and now let's multiply so i'm going to use the calculator for this twelve times negative four is negative 48 and negative 48 times negative 8 that's 384 so that's positive and then it's going to be divided by 4 minus 8x raised to the fifth power and that's the answer what about this problem what is the derivative of five minus nine x divided by x squared plus four so here we have another rational function go ahead and differentiate this expression so we need to use the quotient rule because we have a variable in the numerator and the variable in the denominator and we can't simplify this expression so here's the quotient rule the derivative of f divided by g is g f prime minus f of g prime over g squared now let's label what we know f is five minus nine x and g is x squared plus four so f prime the derivative of f that's going to be negative 9 and g prime the derivative of g is 2x so let's go ahead and apply this expression to the problem so first let's start with g g is x squared plus four and then it's multiplied to f prime which is negative nine and then minus f which is five minus nine x times g prime that's two x divided by g squared and g is x squared plus four so let's square that expression so we have to answer right now but what we need to do is simplify what we have let's distribute and combine like terms so let's distribute negative nine to x squared plus four so x squared times negative nine that's negative 9 x squared and 4 times negative 9 is negative 36 now let's do the same with that expression so 5 times 2x is 10x but there's a negative sign so that's going to be negative 10x negative 9x times 2x is negative 18x squared but with a negative sign in front that's going to be positive 18x squared now the only thing that we can do now is add those two so negative 9 plus 18 is not so we have 9x squared minus 10x minus 36 divided by x squared plus 4 squared so i'm going to leave the answer like this that's it let's try this example five minus two x over x plus four raised to the fifth power go ahead and find the derivative of that expression so we have a quotient rule mixed with a chain rule type situation so how can we do that well first let's apply the chain rule so let's move the exponent to the front keep the inside function the same and then subtract the exponent by one and now we need to multiply by the derivative of the inside function and that's when we need to use a quotient rule so f is five minus two x which means f prime is negative two g is x plus four so g prime is the derivative of x which is one and the formula is going to be g f prime minus f g prime over g squared let's see if i can fit that here so g is x plus 4 times f prime which is negative two minus f that's five minus two x and thankfully g prime is one so it's not going to change anything and g squared that's gonna be x plus 4 squared now let's see if we could simplify the expression let's focus on combining like terms here and then i can add everything else around it so x plus four times negative two that's going to be negative two x minus eight and then distribute the negative sign to 5 and a negative 2x that's going to be negative 5 plus 2x well these two will cancel and so we have negative 8 minus 5 which is negative 13. so right now i have 5 times five minus two x over x plus four raised to the fourth power and then times negative thirteen over x plus 4 squared so the first thing i can do is multiply 5 and negative 13. and then we're going to separate these two i'm going to apply the 4 to the 5 minus 2x and the x plus 4. so it's going to be 5 minus 2x to the fourth power and divided by x plus 4 to the fourth power 5 times negative 13 that's negative 65. now the reason why i wanted to separate this four into two different fours is because these two are the same i can multiply them together and so the final answer fully simplified is negative 65 times five minus two x raised to the fourth power divided by x plus four and four plus two is six so that's gonna be to the sixth power and this is it you
