Transcript for: Integral of sinx cosx
in this video we're going to focus on finding the integral of sine x cosine x now there's three ways in which we can get the answer the first technique involves u substitution and we're going to replace u with sine x d u the derivative of sine is going to be cosine x dx and so let's substitute sine with the u variable and let's replace cosine x dx with du so this becomes the integral of u d u using the power rule this is going to be u to the second power divided by 2 plus some constant c and then now we need to replace you with sine x so the answer is going to be one half sine squared x plus c so this is just one of the three ways in which we can represent the answer now here's the second way so let's start back with the original problem but instead of making u equal to sine let's make u equal to cosine x d u is going to be the derivative of cosine which is negative sine x dx now in this example i'm going to solve for dx it's d u divided by sine so let's replace cosine with u and let's replace the dx with du divided by negative sine x so we're going to have the integral of sine x times the u variable times d u over negative sine so we could cancel sine and so we have negative integral u to the first d u which is going to be u squared over two plus c and this time u is cosine so this is going to be negative one half cosine squared plus c and so this is the second way to represent the answer now let's focus on the third method of getting this answer it has to do with the double angle formula of sine 2x now sine 2x is equal to two sine x cosine x so if we multiply both sides by a half we're gonna have one half sine two x on the left side and on the right side two times a half is one so it's just going to be sine x cosine x on the right side so therefore what we're going to do is replace sine x cosine x with this expression so now we have the integral of one half sine two x dx now i'm going to move the constant to the front now what is the antiderivative of sine 2x the antiderivative of sine is negative cosine the angle will stay the same 2x and then we need to divide it by the derivative of the angle which is 2. and then plus c so the answer that we have is negative one fourth cosine two x plus c so the three answers that we got for the integral of sine x cosine x was this one that we just got and then the first one was one half sine squared x plus c and the second one was negative one half cosine squared plus c now the reason why we have these three answers is because there's multiple forms of the double angle formula for cosine 2x i'm going to focus on two of the three forms cosine two x is equal to one minus two sine squared x and it's also equal to 2 cosine squared x minus 1. the third form is cosine squared minus sine squared so starting with this expression let's replace cosine 2x with this expression so it was negative 1 4 and then instead of writing cosine 2x i'm going to insert 1 minus 2 sine squared and let's not forget about the constant plus c so this is going to be negative one fourth and then if we multiply negative 1 4 by negative 2 sine squared it's going to be positive one half sine squared plus c now when you add negative 1 4 plus some unknown constant combined you could just write it as a single constant so we can replace negative 1 4 plus c with just c so that would be just a generic constant and you can see that you get the same expression now let's replace cosine 2x with cosine squared x times 2 minus 1. so instead of writing negative 1 4 cosine 2x let's replace the cosine 2x with this and then we have a plus c on the outside so negative 1 4 times 2 that's going to be negative 1 over 2 cosine squared x and then negative 1 4 times negative 1 that's positive 1 4 and then plus the constant c so 1 4 plus a constant is equal to another constant which we can just replace with some generic constant just like we did before and that will give us the same expression so as you can see you can write the integral of sine x cosine x in any one of these three forms because you can convert one form into another using the double angle formulas for cosine you
