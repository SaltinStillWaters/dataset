Transcript for: How To Find The Limit of a Composite Function Given Two Graphs
in this video we're going to talk about how to evaluate the limit of a composite function from a graph so let's start with this expression we want to find the limit as X approaches negative three of f of G of x so this expression is equivalent to what I'm about to write here so we have f and then we're going to take the limit as X approaches negative 3 of the function G of x so G of X is the graph on the right side and here is an x value of negative three if we approach from the left side notice that g will gain a y value of the negative 2. and the same is true if we approach from the right side so from either side it's going to be negative 2. so this is going to equal the limit as G of x approaches negative two for the expression f of G of x so as X approaches negative three G approaches negative two now this part you need to be careful with here's a question for you there's G of X does it approach negative two from the left side or from the right side think about that that's very important so as X approaches negative three from the left side we know G approaches negative two now G is on the y axis so the G function it's approaching this y value of negative two from above this point and as we approach negative three from the right side G is approaching negative two from above negative two as well as G approaches negative two from above in this graph it's equivalent to F approaching negative two from the right side so you need to translate the word above in the G function with the word from the right in the function for f because the Y value for this function will become the x value for this function because G is inside of f you may want to take a minute to make sure you internalize that and you could visualize it as well with a number line which I'm going to put here so here is negative 2 and we're focused on the Y values as we approach from this side the Y values they're decreasing here the Y value is zero it's negative one negative 1.5 negative 1.9 negative 2. so it's greater than negative 2. from here if we go from this side it's 0 negative 1 negative 1.5 negative 1.9 and negative 2. so this side is negative 2.1 Which is less than negative 2 over here this is negative 1.9 which is greater than negative 2. so as we go towards negative 2 we need to hit negative 1.9 before we get to negative 2. we're not going to get to negative 2.1 which means we're coming from this side from negative 1.9 to negative 2. so as we approach negative 2 from above in the case of G that equates to approach a negative 2 from the right along the x-axis in the graph of F and that's the concept I want you to understand here so feel free to rewind the video if you need to to make sure you grasp that concept because that's important and when dealing with the limit of composite functions so now that we know we are approaching that g is approaching negative two from the right now that we move on to the graph of f we need to look at the x value of negative two and we need to approach it from the right fortunately if we approach it from the left or the right we're going to get the same y value for f which is positive 3. so that's going to be the answer to this problem the end result is a value of 3. now let's move on to the next example so let's try this one let's find the limit as X approaches negative one of f of G of x so feel free to work on that example problem so here is negative one on G but first let's write it this way so this is equivalent to f and then we're going to take the limit as X approaches negative one of G of x now let's make sure that the limit exists as we approach negative one from the left side the Y value is four and as we approach negative one from the right side we still get a y value of 4. so as X approaches negative one G approaches 4. so I'm going to write the limit as G of x approaches four of the function f of G of x g is still inside of f now as we approach 4 or as we approach an x value of negative one and as the Y value approaches 4. is G going to four from the left or four from from the right what would you say in the last problem we were approaching negative two some above so that's where looking at the Y values not the X values here we're approaching the Y value of 4 from Below so when you approach a y value from above it's going to be associated with a positive sign or from the right when you approach a y value From Below it's going to be associated with a negative sign or from the left and that's what we have here so because we're approaching the Y value of 4 and below when we move on to the next graph G is going to approach 4 on the left side and let's use the number line to verify this so let's put 4 because that's the Y value we're approaching to the right of positive four will be 4.1 to the left will be 3.9 so notice that we're going up so here the Y value is 2 2.53 3.5 3.94 . so we're coming from the left we're not going above 4 to 4.1 we'll start from 3 to 3.5 to 3.9 to 4. so that's why we could put the negative sign here because we're approaching 4 from the left side or from below it though G of X will be the input of f so this is going to be the x value for the F function so here we're approaching 4 not from the right but from the left so as we approach an x value of 4 from the left the Y value is going to be two if we were to approach positive 4 from the right side the Y value will be 1. so in this case in order to get this question right we need to choose the appropriate sign here we need to know if we're going from we're going to 4 from the right or 4 to the left because that will affect the final answer in this example go ahead and try this problem find the limit as X approaches 2 of f of G of x now feel free to pause the video if you want to work on this example Problem by the way for those of you who want more the practice problems on limits in general maybe have a test to study for check out the links in the description section below I'm going to be posting more content on limits so that you can pass your next exam so feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance so first we're going to rewrite this expression as f of the limit as X approaches 2 of G of x so here is an x value of 2. now for this one you need to be careful because it's a little different than the previous problems and here's why if we focus on the Y values here we're approaching a y value of negative two from above and here we're approaching a y value of negative 2 from above so it's the same for that now for the 4 for the second problem we approach a y value of 4 from above and on the right side we approach a y value of 4 from above as well so that's the same so this one is different because as we approach the x value of 2 the Y value that corresponds to G is one but notice that we're approaching the Y value of 1 from above on one side but on the other side we're approaching a y value of one from or below so because those directions are different in terms of the Y value not the X what's going to happen is it's going to give us two different values for G once we're trying to get F from G so we're going to have to break this problem into two parts we need to determine the left side limit and the right side limit because they will give us different values of G so let's find F of the limit as X approaches 2 from the right of G of x so here is the x value of 2. it's right here and we're going to approach it from the right side so as we approach 2 from the right side we get a y value of one but notice we are approaching the Y value of one from below it's from the right but it's from Below so we're approaching along x axis from the right but we're going we're approaching a y value of one from Below us so what's going to happen is we're going to get the limit as a g approaches positive one now because we're approaching the Y value From Below this is going to be from the left side when we translate it to the next graph because as the Y values increase towards one we need to go from 0 to 0.5 to 1 so we're going from the left side of one so that's how we have the negative sign and not the positive sign and this is going to be of f of G of x so now that we have that let's take this value and move it along the x-axis of the function for f so 1 is basically this vertical asymptote here as we approach one from the left we're following this part of the curve notice that it's going up to positive Infinity now let's check the other side so let's find F of the limit as X approaches 2 from the left of G of x so as we approach the x value of 2 for the function of G and we're doing it from the left side we're going to get the limit as G of x it's still approaching a positive value of one but notice that we're coming from above so as we approach the Y value of one from above when we translate it to f of x it's going to be the same as approaching this from the right side because you're going 2 1 from higher values so here the Y value is 2 and it's 1.5 1.1 and then one so we're going if on a number line from the right of 1. so let's put a plus there I was trying to get rid of this Arrow but I guess it's just gonna have to stay now but now as we plug in this into F at G of X approaches one so we have F of one that's on the right so as we follow this to an x value of one the curve is going towards negative Infinity now because the right sided limit and the left-sided limit are different the original limit does not exist because they're different so that's it for a problem now let's work on one more example what is the limit as X approaches 3 from the left side of f of G of x feel free to try that so here is an x value of 3. and we're approaching it from the left side and that will give us a y value of negative one so this is f of the limit as X approaches 3 from the left of G of x and as we approach 3 from the left G goes to negative one so I'm just going to continue this here so we have the limit as G goes to negative one of f of G of x now as G approaches negative one from the left side or from the right side so looking at the Y values the curve is approaching negative one from above so that means that we're approaching negative one from the right side along the number line so now we move on to the graph of f as G approaches negative one from the right or in other words that's X approaches negative one from the right notice that we now we have two curves at negative one we have this one and this one and this one is on the left side this one is on the right side so we got to start from this curve and we go towards negative one which will give us a y value of four so that's going to be the answer for this problem so that's basically it for this video hopefully it gave you a good introduction in terms of how to evaluate limits of composite functions so they could be tricky but one thing I recommend is to pay attention to this part once you get the value for G like where it's going make sure you determine if it's approaching that value from the left side or from the right side if it approaches negative one from below or above because if you're not careful with that all right you could make some mistakes and that can cost you and getting the right answers so be careful with that part
