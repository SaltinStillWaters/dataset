Transcript for: Limits of Trigonometric Functions
now let's work on some examples involving limits with trigonometric functions there are some equations that you need to know here's the first one the limit as x approaches 0 of sine x divided by x is equal to 1. so now let's confirm it a nice simple technique to evaluate any limit if you have access to a calculator is to plug in a number that's very close to what x is approaching to in this case it's approaching zero so let's try 0.1 make sure your calculator is in radian mode by the way sine of 0.1 divided by 0.1 that's equal to 0.998 which is very close to 1. now let's try point zero one let's see what's going to happen so this is going to be 0.99998 which is even closer to 1. so we know that this equation holds true now there's another formula that you need to know it's the limit as x approaches 0 1 minus cosine x divided by x this is equal to 0. so to confirm it let's plug in 0.1 let's see what number we're going to get if we do this so this is going to give you 0.05 approximately it rounds to 0.05 now let's try an even smaller number let's try 0.01 so this will give you 0.005 notice that these two numbers are not the same they look similar but this number is 10 times smaller it's getting closer and closer to zero just to confirm it let's try an even smaller number point zero zero one so this will be point zero zero zero so as we can see as x gets closer and closer to zero notice that y approaches zero as well so this equation holds true now let's work on this problem what is the limit as x approaches 0 of sine 5x divided by x what is that equal to now keep in mind we know that the limit as x approaches of sine x divided by x is one for those of you who quickly want to see the answer it's going to be five x divided by one x which is five but you gotta show your work though but that's just a quick way to get the answer for those of you who want that what you need to do is multiply the top and the bottom by five and we're going to take this five and move it over here so this is equal to the limit as x approaches zero sine five x divided by five x times five now we're going to do is we're going to use substitution let's say that y is equal to 5x so notice that the limit as x approaches 0 of 5x that's equal to zero that's also equivalent to the limit as y approaches zero of y since y is equal to five x as x approaches zero we know that this limit becomes zero and this is also equal to zero so therefore they're equal to each other so therefore as x approaches zero five x becomes zero and five x is y so y becomes zero two so i'm making that statement we need to realize that we can now change the limit to this expression we can say the limit as y approaches zero sine y divided by y times five so all we did is we substituted five x with y now we can use the formula if the limit as x approaches zero for sine x over x if that's one then the limit as y approaches zero of sine y divided by y must also be one so this is going to be one times five which is equal to five and that's the answer so what you wanna do is you want to make these two values the same and then you could replace it with a letter like y and then evaluate the limit that way let's try this problem what is the limit as x approaches 0 of sine 2x divided by 5x what do you think the answer to this problem is going to be it turns out that it's just 2 divided by 5. you can literally see it but now let's show our work so what we need to do is multiply the top and the bottom by two over two what i'm going to do is switch the two and the five so we can rewrite it as the limit as x approaches zero sine two x divided by two x times two over five so i just switched to places of these two numbers five times two and two times five they both equal ten so the value is still the same now once these two values are the same you can use substitution so we're going to let y equal to 2x so therefore we're going to change our expression as the limit as y approaches zero sine y divided by y times two over five now we can use that one identity where the limit as x approaches zero of sine x divided by x is one so this expression in blue is also equal to 1. so our final answer is 2 divided by 5 but now you can show your work this is how you're going to show your work if you have to take it on a test but if it's a multiple choice problem you can clearly see that it's 2 over 5. now what about this one what is the limit as x approaches 0 for sine 7x divided by sine 3x feel free to pause the video and work in this problem so just by looking at it we could see that it's seven divided by three but let's show our work so what we're going to do is we're going to multiply the top and the bottom by seven over seven three over three and x over x so now let's separate everything so i'm going to leave the sine 7x on top however i need to put seven and x i need to move this over here i want it to be below sine seven x now i need to do something with the sine 3x so i have to keep it on the bottom but on top i want 3x above it so i'm going to write it here now what i have left over is seven over three which i can put it in this third fraction so every number has been accounted for i just simply rearranged everything so let's say that y is equal to 7x and let's say another variable w let's let it equal to 3x so we're going to have the limit as y approaches 0 sine y over y so that's for this portion and then we're going to multiply that by the limit as w approaches zero of w divided by sine w since three x we set it equal to w and then we're gonna multiply everything by seven over three so therefore this becomes one this expression is also one and then times seven divided by three so the final answer is seven over three and that's it let's try this one the limit as x approaches 0 tangent x divided by x what do you think the answer to this problem is going to be well tangent we know is sine divided by cosine but first let's rewrite it like this let's separate x and tangent x and now in the next step let's replace tangent with side over cosine so this is equal to the limit as x approaches zero sine x divided by x i'm gonna switch these two multiplied by one over cosine x now as we apply the limit sine x over x based on the formula will change to one now what about cosine cosine of zero is one so as x approaches 0 this becomes 1 as well so the answer is 1. and you could see it tangent x and sine x are very similar 1x over 1x is 1. here's another example let's say if we want to find the limit as x approaches 0 of tan 4x divided by 3x the answer is going to be 4 over 3 but let's prove it so first let's convert tangent into sine over cosine so this is going to be sine four x divided by cosine four x times one over three x now we need to multiply the top and the bottom by four over four so we need to take x and four and move it under sign so this is equal to the limit as x approaches zero sine four x divided by four x times one over cosine four x times four over three we had a four on top and a three on the bottom now let's say that y is equal to four x so this becomes the limit as y approaches zero sine y divided by y times one over cosine y times four over three sine y over y will change into one cosine zero is one so the final answer is going to be four over three what about this one the limit as x approaches zero seven times one minus cosine x divided by x what's the answer now if you recall the limit as x approaches zero of one minus cosine x divided by x that's equal to zero so it's sure our work we're gonna separate seven from everything else so we know this portion here is zero so our answer is going to be seven times zero which is zero now let's try a different example what is the limit as x approaches zero sine squared x divided by x take a minute and try that problem so sine squared is basically sine x times sine x so we have sine x over x times x now let's separate this into two limits the limit as x approaches zero of sine x divided by x we know that's one the limit as x approaches zero of x well you can use direct substitution that's going to be zero so 1 times 0 is 0. so this is the final answer consider this one the limit as x approaches 0 sine of x squared divided by x what's the answer well what we need to do first is we need to multiply the top and bottom by x so we're going to get the limit as x approaches 0 sine of x squared divided by x squared so we combine these two together and then we have an x on top left over now let's use substitution let's set y equal to x squared but before we replace x squared of y let's write this expression using two limits so now on the left we say the limit as y approaches zero sine y divided by y times the limit as x approaches zero of the function x on the left sine y over y will change into one and the limit as x approaches zero of x is zero so the answer is zero
