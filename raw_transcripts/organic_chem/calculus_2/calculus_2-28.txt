Transcript for: Introduction to Limits
let's talk about limits what exactly is a limit so let's say if we want to find the limit as x approaches 2 of the function x squared minus 4 divided by x minus two now this is different than plugging in two if you want to find the value of the function and when x is two you would substitute this would be 2 squared minus 4 divided by 2 minus 2. 2 squared is 4 and 4 minus 4 is 0 2 minus 2 is 0. 0 over 0 we don't know what that is it could be 0 it could be infinity it could be undefined it could be eight we don't know so the function is not defined at two when x is two we don't have a specific value however as x approaches 2 it does converge to a specific value let me explain so let's plug in a number that is not exactly 2 but something that's close to 2. and let's make a table so we're going to have our x values and the values of the function so let's just try 1.9 1.9 squared minus 4 divided by 1.9 minus 2. what does that equal if you type that in your calculator you should get 3.9 now let's pick a number that's even closer to 2. for example 1.99 let's see what's going to happen type this in your calculator to see what answer you get this will give you 3.99 now let's try 1.99 well 1.999 do you see a pattern what number is the limit converging to this is equal to 3.999 so notice that as x approaches 2 the expression x squared minus four over x minus two it approaches the number four it gets closer and closer to four so therefore the limit is four evaluate the limit as x approaches 3 of x cubed minus 27 divided by x minus 3. now we can't use direct substitution if we plug in 3 the way it is this will give us a 0 divided by 0 which is indeterminate and we can't find the value of that so we're not going to do it that way instead let's plug in numbers that are very close to three so let's start with 2.9 2.9 to the third power minus 27 divided by 2.9 minus 3. when you type this in feel free to use parentheses if you're not getting the answer that i have so this will give you 26.11 now what about when x gets closer to 3. let's try 2.99 let's see if it converges to a specific value so this will give you 26.91 and if we try 2.999 let's see what's going to happen by now you can see the answer so this is going to be 26.99 so therefore we can see that as x approaches 3 as it gets closer and closer to 3 the y value approaches 27 so therefore the limit as x approaches 3 of x cubed minus 27 over x minus 3 is equal to 27. what is the limit as x approaches 3 of the function x squared plus seven x plus three so we need to find the limit of this polynomial function how can we do so well the first thing that you should try to do is direct substitution plug in three if you don't get a zero on the bottom of a fraction then you should be fine in this case there is no fraction so we don't have to worry about that so we can use direct substitution to evaluate this limit analytically so if we plug in three it's going to be three squared plus seven times three plus three three squared is nine seven times three that's 21 and nine plus 21 is 30 and 30 plus three is 33 so therefore the limit as x approaches 3 for this function is 33. so as you can see direct substitution is a nice technique hopefully you'll get more questions like this on the test let's try another example let's say if the limit as x approaches five let's find it given this rational function x squared minus three x plus four divided by x plus two so let's go ahead and use direct substitution so this is going to be 5 squared minus 3 times 5 plus 4 divided by 5 plus 2. 5 squared that's 25 three times five is fifteen and five plus two is seven twenty five minus fifteen is ten ten plus four is fourteen so we got fourteen divided by seven which in the end is equal to two what is the limit as x approaches two square root x plus seven divided by x plus one go ahead and use direct substitution to get the answer so this is going to be the square root of two plus seven divided by two plus one now two plus seven is nine and two plus one is three the square root of 9 is 3 and 3 divided by 3 is 1. so that's the answer as you can see direct substitution is a nice simple and easy technique to use what is the limit of this particular trigonometric function sine x as x approaches pi over four now what is that equal to now it might be helpful to know what pi over four is in degrees to convert radians to degrees multiply it by 180 over pi so notice that the pi values cancel 180 divided by 4 is 45 degrees so basically you can plug in pi over 4 or 45. so what is sine 45 using a unit circle is equal to the square root of 2 divided by 2. you can also use your calculator to get that answer let's try another example what is the limit as x approaches pi over 3 of the function of tangent x now tangent is equivalent to sine divided by cosine so we could use direct substitution again so this is going to be sine pi over 3 divided by cosine pi over three so what is sine pi over three pi over three is sixty by the way 180 is the same as pi so 180 over 3 is 60. sine 60 is root 3 divided by 2 cosine six t is one half so if we multiply the top and the bottom by two these two will cancel we're going to get the square root of three on top and two times a half is one so the final answer is root three now what about this one the limit as x approaches pi over six of the function secant x now secant is equivalent to 1 divided by cosine so we can use direct substitution what is cosine pi divided by six pi over six or 180 divided by six is thirty cosine thirty is root three divided by two now what is one divided by root three over two to figure this out you can multiply the top and the bottom by two so on top one times two is two on the bottom the two's cancel so we have this two divided by root three now we need to rationalize it the square root of three times the square root of three is the square root of nine which is three so this is the answer two root three divided by three you
