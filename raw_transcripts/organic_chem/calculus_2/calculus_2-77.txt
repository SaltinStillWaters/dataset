Transcript for: Derivatives of Radical Functions
today we're going to talk about how to find the derivative of radical functions so let's start with something simple what is the derivative of the square root of x go ahead and try that what do you think we need to do here the first thing we need to do is we need to rewrite the expression the square root of x is basically x to the one half the index number is an invisible two and the exponent is a one so for instance let's say if you have the fifth root of x cubed you can rewrite that as x to the three fifths or if you have the seventh root of x to the fourth you can write that as x to the four over seven so you have to rewrite the radical as a rational exponent now we need to apply the power rule and just to review the power rule is the derivative of x to the n is n x raised to the n minus one so we're going to move the one half to the front and so we're gonna have one half x and then it's gonna be one half minus one now we need to get common denominators one is the same as two over two and one minus two is negative one so one over two minus two over two is negative half this is the answer but we still need to simplify so this is equivalent to one x raised to the negative one half divided by two now to make the negative exponent a positive one we'll need to take the variable move it to the bottom so right now this is going to be one over two x but raised to the positive one half as opposed to negative one-half the last thing we need to do is convert the rational exponent back into its radical form so x to the one-half is the square root of x and so this is the final answer now let's talk about how to find the derivative of another similar example and this is going to be the square root of x plus five so first let's rewrite the expression so this is basically x plus five raised to the one half now we need to use the chain rule in addition to the power rule and here's the gist of using the chain rule so basically we have a composite function f of g of x so notice that the inside part of the function g of x is x plus five the outside function f of x is just x to the one half now if you need to find the derivative of a composite function using a chain rule you need to differentiate the outside function and then keep the inside part the same and then multiply by the derivative of the inside function so that's the gist of differentiating composite functions using the chain rule so let's apply that let's differentiate the outside function by using the power rule first so we're going to move the one half to the front and we're going to keep the inside part g of x the same and then we're gonna subtract the exponent by one using the power rule so one half minus one we know it's negative one half and then we'll need to multiply by the derivative of the inside function g of x so the derivative of x plus five is one now we need to simplify our answer so this is going to be it's x plus five raised to the negative one half times one divided by two and now let's move this to the bottom so it's one over two x plus five raised to the negative one half i mean positive one half now and so the final answer is one over two square root x plus five it's very similar to the last problem because this was a one so here's another problem it's actually very similar to the last one just with a few extra details go ahead and find the derivative of the square root of x squared minus four so first rewrite the expression so this is x squared minus 4 raised to the one half now let's use the chain rule so let's bring the exponent to the front keep the inside function the same and then subtract the exponent by one one half minus one is negative one half and then multiply by the derivative of the inside the derivative of the inside function x squared minus four is two x now one half times two is one so we can get rid of the one half and the two now we need to take this term and move it to the bottom so right now what we have is x divided by x squared minus 4 raised to the positive one half now the last thing we need to do is convert the rational exponent into its radical form so the final answer is x divided by the square root of x squared minus four and so that's the solution let's work on another example let's determine the derivative of the cube root of five x plus two feel free to pause the video and try this example the best way to learn is to work through these examples and then you can improve your skill and your understanding of this material so like before let's rewrite the expression so this time we have five x plus two and five x plus two is basically raised to the first power and we have an index of three so this is going to be raised to the one third now like before we're still going to use the chain rule so let's work on the exponents first let's use the power rule so we're going to move the 1 3 to the front and keep the inside function g of x the same and then we're going to subtract the exponent one third by one so one third minus one that's the same as one could be changed to three over three so we need to get common denominators one minus three is negative two so this is going to be negative two thirds and then we need to multiply by g prime the derivative of the inside function so the derivative of five x plus two is five so right now we have a five on top five x plus two raised to the negative two thirds is also in the numerator and the three is in the bottom so now let's take this term move it to the bottom so it's going to be five over three and then five x plus two but raised to the positive two thirds and now let's rewrite it in its radical form so this is going to be the cube root of 5 x plus 2 squared now that's the answer if you want to rationalize the denominator you could if you want to do that his we need to do multiply the bottom and the top by the cube root of 5x plus 2. by the way if you leave your answer like this most teachers will accept the answer unless they specifically state to rationalize any denominator now i need three 5x plus twos i have two of them so i need one more and this will give me the one more that i need so in the numerator i'm going to have 5 times the cube root of 5 x plus 2 and in the denominator i'm going to have 3 times the cube root of five x plus two but i have three of them now now the threes will cancel three divided by three is one so the radical will disappear and the final answer is five cube root five x plus two divided by three times five x plus two and i'm gonna stop here for this problem here's another problem that you could try one over the fourth root of x to the fifth power so first let's rewrite it so this is going to be 1 over x to the 5 over 4 and i'm going to move this to the top so this is x to the negative 5 4. so now we can use the power rule so it's going to be negative 5 over 4 x and then we need to subtract 5 over 4 by 1. so we can rewrite 1 as 4 over 4. negative five minus four is negative nine so this is going to be negative nine over four so what we have is negative five x raised to negative nine over four divided by four and now let's move the variable to the bottom of the fraction so it's negative five over four x to the positive nine over four and now let's convert the rational exponent into a radical so this is going to be the fourth root of x to the ninth power now we could simplify it so i'm going to rewrite x to the 9 as x to the 8 times x now the fourth root of x to the eight you need to divide eight by four you get two so that's going to be four x squared times the fourth root of x now if you want to rationalize it we need four x variables to be inside of this fraction i mean not the fraction but inside the radical so i'm going to multiply the top and the bottom by the fourth root of x cubed whatever you do to the top you must always do to the bottom so in the numerator i have negative five times the four fruit of x cubed in the denominator i have four x squared times the fourth root of one plus three is four so x to the four and then if i divide four by four that's going to give me one so then this is negative five times the four root of x cubed over four x squared times x so the final answer is negative five fourth root of x cubed over four x cubed that's it now let's try one more example so let's go ahead and find the derivative of eight divided by the seventh root of three minus two x raised to the fourth power so go ahead and try that now first we need to rewrite it so let's convert the radical into a rational exponent so it's 3 minus 2x and it's going to be raised to the 4 over 7. and then we need to take this expression move it to the top so we have the derivative of eight times three minus two x raised to the four over seven so now let's use the chain rule and the constant multiple rule so it's gonna be eight that's the constant times the derivative of this expression so let's move the exponent to the front keep the inside function the same and then subtract the exponent by one so four over seven minus 1 that's going to be 4 over 7 minus 7 over 7 which is negative 3 over 7. and then we need to multiply by the derivative of the inside function so the derivative of three minus two x is negative two so now let's simplify so we have four times negative two that's negative eight times eight so that's going to be negative 64. and it's divided by seven now in the numerator we still have three minus two x to the negative three over the seventh power and so let's take that move it to the bottom and so that's negative 64 divided by seven times three minus two x raised to the three over seven and then let's convert it back into its radical form so it's going to be the seventh root of three minus two x to the third power now if you wish to rationalize it we need to multiply the top and bottom by the seventh root of three minus two x but raised to the fourth power since we already have three of them and we need to get to seven so it's going to be negative 64 times the seventh root of three minus two x to the fourth power divided by seven and then times the seventh root of three minus two x to the seventh power so these will cancel and now we're going to get the final answer and that's it you
