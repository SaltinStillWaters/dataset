Transcript for: Limits of Hyperbolic Functions
in this video we're going to talk about how to evaluate the limits of hyperbolic functions so here we have three examples regarding hyperbolic science and to do this it's really helpful if you have a graph in front of you so I recommend drawing a graph for hyperbolic sign a rough just a rough schedule will do and it looks something like this so now what happens to the Y value of this graph as we approach Infinity along the x-axis so that means as we approach to the right as X goes to an to positive Infinity notice what happens to y y goes up to positive Infinity so that's going to be the limit as X approaches positive Infinity for a hyperbolic sign now what about as X approaches negative Infinity in this case we're going to the left along the x-axis following the curve we can see it goes down to negative Infinity in the y direction so the Y value will be negative Infinity now what about as X approaches 0 from the right so here's the origin has an x value of zero as we approach it from the right the Y value becomes zero so that's going to be the answer for that problem so that's how you can evaluate the limit of hyperbolic functions now let's try some other examples let's move on to tangent what is the limit as X approaches positive Infinity for hyperbolic tangent feel free to pause the video and work on these problems we'll also look at the left end behavior and what is the limit as X approaches zero from the left side so go ahead and work on those three examples so I'm going to begin by drawing a graph of hyperbolic tangent so hyperbolic tangent has two horizontal asymptotes one at y equals positive one the other one at y equals negative one and the graph is an increase in function and it looks like that so as we approach as X goes to positive Infinity notice the Y value approaches one so that's going to be this answer as we go towards negative Infinity to the left on the x-axis the Y value approaches negative one and for the last one as we approach an x value of Zero from the left side this has a y value of zero so this is going to be equal to zero now let's try some more examples go ahead and find the limit as X approaches positive Infinity of let's say secant hyperbolic secant and let's get the limit as X approaches zero from the left of hyperbolic secant as well so go ahead and try those two problems so let's begin by drawing a graph of hyperbolic secant this graph looks something like this let me draw that better and this point has a y value of one so starting with the first example as X approaches positive Infinity the Y value is zero we're going close and closer to the x axis so this is going to be zero as X approaches zero from the left that is as we follow this curve towards an x value of zero we can see the Y value is one so the best way to really evaluate the limits of hyperbolic functions in my opinion is to draw the graph as long as you know the graphs of these hyperbolic functions it's going to be easy or relatively easy to evaluate the limits now let's try a few examples with cotangent so find the limit as X approaches negative Infinity for hyperbolic cotangent let's also go to positive Infinity and then let's find the limit as X approaches zero be careful with that one so feel free to pause the video and work on those examples let's begin by drawing a graph so hyperbolic cotangent has two horizontal asymptotes just like tangent the first one is that y equals one the second one is at y equals negative one now hyperbolic cotangent also has a vertical asymptote and this one is at x equals zero so the graph looks something like this so that's a rough sketch of the graph for hyperbolical tangent now as we approach as X goes to negative Infinity that is as we go all the way to the left and this curve is approaching a y value of negative one so that's going to be this answer for the next one the limit as X approaches positive Infinity for hyperbolical tangent as we go to the right we're positive Infinity for X's notice that this curve approaches a y value of one so that's going to be positive one now what about at zero as we approach the limit as we approach as X approaches 0 rather what does the limit approach what a value does it converge to now for this one we need to look at the left and the right sided limits if we look at the the left-sided limit so here is when X is zero as we follow the curve going towards zero started from the left notice that this is going down towards negative Infinity now as we follow the curve go into Zero from the right side so here's the right side we're approaching an x value of zero the Y value is going to positive Infinity notice that the left-sided limit and the right-sided limit they're different therefore the limit as X approaches zero does not exist because the left side and the right side they don't match in value they have different values so that's going to be the answer for this one the limit does not exist so that's basically it for this particular topic so now you know how to evaluate limits of hyperbolic functions and it's very helpful if you know the graphs of these functions
