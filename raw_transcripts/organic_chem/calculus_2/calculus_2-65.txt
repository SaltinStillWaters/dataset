Transcript for: Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions
today we're going to go over the derivatives of trigonometric functions and there's six of them that you need to know let's start with the first one the derivative of sine x is cosine x and the derivative of cosine x is negative sine x now look for a pattern as i write these uh trigonometric functions the derivative of tangent is secant squared and the derivative of cotangent the cofunction of tangent is cosecant squared but with a negative sign the derivative of secant that's equal to secant x tangent x and the derivative of cosecant x is negative cosecant x cotangent x so notice that the derivative for every cofunction particularly those that start with a c they all have a negative sign and notice that the similarity between tan and cotan the derivative of tangent is secant squared the derivative of cotan is negative cosecant squared and secant and cosecant are similar the derivative of secant is secant tan and the derivative of cosecant negative cosecant cotangent so there's some similarities here if you know the left side you can easily figure out what's on the right side of the screen but now let's go ahead and work on some examples so let's find the derivative of this expression five sine x minus four tangent x so distributing this symbol it's going to be five times the derivative of sine x minus four times the derivative of tangent x now we know that the derivative of sine is positive cosine and the derivative of tangent is secant squared so the answer is 5 cosine x minus 4 secant squared x now let's work on another similar example let's say if we want to find the derivative of eight secant x minus five cosine x so based on the last example go ahead and try this one so this is equal to eight times the derivative of secant x minus five times the derivative of cosine x now the derivative of secant that's going to be secant tangent the derivative of cosine is a negative sine so the final answer is going to be eight secant x tangent x plus five sine x now let's work on one more example let's try the derivative of two cotangent x minus seven cosecant x so this is going to be two times the derivative of cotangent x and then minus seven times the derivative of cosecant x now what is the derivative of cotangent x now think about the derivative of tangent the derivative of tangent is secant squared so the derivative of cotangent is going to be cosecant squared but because we have a c it's going to be a negative sign in front so it's going to be negative cosecant squared x the derivative of cosecant well we know that the derivative of secant is secant tangent so the derivative of cosecant will be negative cosecant cotangent so you really need to know the derivative of sine tangent and secant if you know those three you can figure out the other three so the final answer is going to be negative 2 cosecant squared plus 7 cosecant x cotangent x if you want to you can take out the gcf which is cosecant x i'm going to leave the answer like this you
