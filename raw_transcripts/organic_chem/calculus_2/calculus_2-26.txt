number one condense the following expression into a single logarithm so go ahead and try this problem the first thing we need to do is move the coefficients to their exponent positions so this is equivalent to log x to the third power minus log y to the fifth power plus log z raised to the two thirds so now we can write it as a single log expression the logs that have a plus sign will go on the top so x cubed and z to the two-thirds are going to go in the numerator of this fraction this one is associated with a negative log so y to the fifth is going to go on the bottom and so that's how you can write it as a single log and if you want to you can write z to the two thirds as the cube root of z squared number two expand the following logarithmic expression into a sum or difference of logs the first thing that we can do in this problem is we can move the 5 to the front so this is going to be 5 log cube root of a b squared over c to the fourth now i'm going to rewrite this as 5 log i'm going to change the cube root of a b squared that's equivalent to a b squared raised to the one third and i'm going to distribute the one third so it's a to the one third b to the two thirds over c to the fourth so now we can expand into uh multiple logs so it's going to be five log a to the one third plus log b to the two thirds and because c is on the bottom it's going to be negative log c to the fourth power now the last thing that we need to do is move the exponents back and write them as coefficients so it's five times one third log a plus two thirds log b minus four log c so that's the answer and if we want to we could distribute the five but we don't have to we can leave it like this number three what is the domain of the logarithmic function shown below in order to find this you can graph the function and then you can literally see what the domain is going to be another technique that you can use is you can set the inside portion of the log greater than zero you cannot have a zero inside a log log of zero does not exist and log of a negative number does not exist so only positive numbers can exist inside the log function so now let's subtract both sides by five negative x is greater than negative five now if we divide both sides by negative one the inequality will change direction so x is less than five if we plot this on a number line we have an open circle at five and because x is less than 5 we're going to shade to the left so the domain is going to be from negative infinity to 5 but not including 5. therefore b is the right answer to this problem number four what is the range of the exponential function shown below this time we're going to go ahead and graph it so let's take the exponent and we're going to set it equal to two things zero and one so if we solve for x x is going to be three and four so we're gonna make our table based on those values three and four now when x is equal to three what is the value of y three minus three is zero two to the zero is one one plus one is two and when x is equal to four three minus i mean four minus three is one so we get two to the first power plus one that's two plus one that's three and then we have the horizontal asymptote which is y is equal to one now let's draw a rough sketch so let's start with the horizontal asymptote and then we have the point three comma two which is here and four comma three so the graph is going to start from the horizontal asymptote and then it increases now the range has to do with the y values the lowest y value is the horizontal asymptote it's 1 and the highest is infinity but it doesn't include one so it's from one to infinity so a is the answer number five calculate the value of x in the equation shown below now if you recall log a plus log b can be combined into a single log by multiplying a and b and that's what we're gonna have to do in this problem so we're going to have log base 2 and then we can multiply x plus 1 together with 5 x plus 1 and all of that should equal 6. now let's convert this equation into its exponential form two raised to the sixth power is equal to the stuff inside and now let's go ahead and foil x plus one times five x plus one x times x i mean x times five x rather that's 5x squared and then we have x times 1 which is simply x and then 1 times 5x and finally 1 times 1. two to the sixth power that's equal to sixty-four x plus five x is six x and now let's subtract both sides by 64. so 0 is equal to 5x squared plus 6x minus 63. so what two numbers that multiply to the product of five times negative 63 adds up to six five times sixty is three hundred five times three is fifteen so this is negative three fifteen factors of 63 are nine and seven so we could try to divide negative three fifteen by nine if we do that that will give us a negative thirty-five factors of nine are three and three so we have five three three and seven so those are some prime numbers so we could use seven and three which is twenty one three fifteen divided by twenty one is 15 and these two differ by six so let's replace 6x with 21x and negative 15x now we can factor it now let's factor by grouping so let's take out the gcf in the first two terms let's reverse the order it might be easier to put the negative 15x with 5x squared so now let's take out the gcf in the first two terms which is going to be 5x 5x squared divided by 5x is x negative 15x divided by 5x is negative 3. and we could take out a 7 from 21 and 63. so this is going to be actually we could take out a 21. and this is going to be x minus 3. 21 times negative 3 is negative 63. so this is going to be x minus 3 times the stuff on the outside which is uh 5x plus 21. so therefore we can see that x is equal to 3 and if we set 5x plus 21 equal to 0 x is going to be negative 21 over 5. so clearly the right answer is answer choice c number six what interest rate compounded quarterly is required to double an 8 000 investment in 10 years so let's write the equation a is equal to p 1 plus r over n raised to the nt so the initial investment is 8 000 and if we're going to double it we need it to turn into sixteen thousand our goal is to solve for r since it's compounding quarterly n is four and we want it to double in ten years so t is ten let's begin by dividing both sides by eight thousand sixteen thousand divided by eight thousand that is equal to two and four times ten is forty so to get rid of the parentheses on the right we need to raise both sides to the reciprocal of 40 which is 1 over 40. 40 times 1 over 40 is one so these two will cancel so the fourth fruit or rather the 40th fruit of 2 is equal to 1 plus r over 4. if we subtract both sides by 1 we'll get this and now to get r by itself we need to multiply both sides by four so r is going to equal four times the 40th root of two minus one so as a decimal r is point zero six nine nine and if we multiply by a hundred percent this will give us six point nine nine percent so that is the interest rate that is needed in order to double the investment in 10 years so b is the right answer if you round it to the nearest whole number number seven which of the following is equivalent to the logarithmic expression shown below so what we need to do is we need to split the log into two separate logs using this formula log a b is equivalent to log a plus log b so therefore log 16 times 32 is log 16 plus log 32 and log 9 times 27 is log 9 plus log 27 and we'll have to distribute the negative sign so what is log base 2 of 16 two to the what power is sixteen how many twos do you have to multiply to get to sixteen two to the fourth power is sixteen so log base two of sixteen is four you can also type in log sixteen divided by log 2 in your calculator and that will also give you 4. 2 to the fifth power is 32 and 3 squared is 9 so log base 3 of 9 is 2. log base 3 of 27 is 3 because three to the third power is twenty-seven it takes three threes to get to twenty-seven four plus five is nine two plus three is five nine minus five is four so therefore d is the right answer number eight calculate the value of x in the equation shown below so what we need to do is convert one over 16 and 64 into a common base such as two or four i think four is easier now we know that four squared is equal to sixteen which means that four raised to the negative two is one over sixteen and also four cubed is sixty-four so let's replace one over sixteen with four to the negative 2 and let's replace 64 with 4 to the third now whenever you have one exponent raised to another exponent you can multiply the two exponents so let's multiply negative 2 by 2x minus three and so that's going to be negative four x plus six and let's multiply three by five x plus one so it's going to be fifteen x plus three now since the bases are equal to each other the exponents must be equal to each other so therefore negative 4x plus 6 has to equal 15x plus 3. so let's add 4x to both sides and let's subtract 3 from both sides 6 minus 3 is 3 15 plus 4 is 19. so therefore x is equal to three over nineteen and so that's the answer number nine determine the value of x in the logarithmic equation shown below so what we need to do is combine the two logs into a single log log a minus log b is equivalent to log a over log b so let's go ahead and use that equation so this is going to be log base 3 on top it's going to be 10 x plus 1 divided by x plus 1 and that's going to equal 2. now let's convert it into its exponential form 3 to the second power is equal to what's inside now three to the second power is nine and what we need to to do at this point is um we need to cross multiply so nine times the stuff on the bottom that's going to be nine x plus nine and then one times the stuff on the top is ten x plus one so now let's subtract both sides by nine x and also by one so ten x minus nine x is x nine minus one is eight so therefore x is equal to eight which means that d is the right answer number 10 the half-life of element x is 8 days how long will it take for 100 grams of element x to decay such that only 12.5 grams of element x remains so there's two ways we're going to do this conceptually and using an equation so let's start with 100 grams of element x the half-life is eight days the half-life is the time it takes for half the substance to decay which means half is going to remain so after eight days there's going to be 50 grams left over after another 8 days 25 and half of 25 is 12.5 so it takes three half-lives or eight times three which is 24 days for element x to decay to a final amount of 12.5 grams so 24 days is the answer but now let's get the same answer using an equation so let's use this equation a is equal to p e raised to the rt so first we need to find the value of r so let's say the initial amount is a hundred and the half-life is eight days so in eight days the final amount is going to be half of 100 it's going to be 50. so let's calculate r if we divide both sides by 100 50 divided by 100 is 0.5 so 0.5 is equal to e raised to the 8r so now let's take the natural log of both sides this will allow us to take the exponent and move it to the front so ln of 0.5 is equal to 8r lne the natural log of e is one and so r is going to be ln point five divided by eight so r is negative point zero eight six six four three so now that we have that let's go and find out how long it's going to take to decay to a final amount of 12.5 so a the final amount is 12.5 p is a hundred r is negative point zero eight six six four three and our goal is to find the value of t so let's divide both sides by a hundred so 12.5 divided by 100 is 0.215 and so it's equal to this now let's go ahead and take the natural log of both sides and then let's move the exponent to the front so the natural log of 0.125 is equal to negative .086643 t lne and lne is one so t is equal to ln 0.125 over negative point zero eight six six four three so let's go ahead and type that in so this will give you 24.0001 which we could just round it to 24. so that's how you can get the answer using the compound and continuous equation or you can just figure it out conceptually but sometimes you might have a perfect number like 12.5 because 12.5 is half of 25 which is half of 50 which is half of 100 they may give you a number like 9.6 or 11.4 in which case you can estimate it using the the first method but if you want to find the exact answer you use the equation as we've used it in this problem
