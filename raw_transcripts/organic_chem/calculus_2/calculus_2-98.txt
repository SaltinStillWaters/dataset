Transcript for: Basic Differentiation Rules For Derivatives
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the derivative of a function and so we're going to go over some basic differentiation rules that you need to know the first one is the power rule the derivative of x raised to the n is going to be n times x raised to the n minus one so based on that formula what is the derivative of x to the second power in this case n is 2 so it's going to be 2 x raised to the 2 minus 1 or 2x to the first power and so that's the answer for the first example based on that try these two determine the derivative of x cubed and x raised to the fourth power so in this case n is 3 so it's going to be 3 x to the 3 minus 1 or 3 x squared now for the next example n is 4 so it's going to be 4 x raised to the 4 minus 1 or 4x cubed and so that's how you could use the power rule to find the derivative of a function now what about this one what is the derivative of x go ahead and try that example so this is basically x raised to the first power so thus n is one so it's going to be one x to the one minus one which is one x to the zero anything raised to the zero power is one so we just get one now what about like the derivative of five x what's going to be the answer now if you have a constant in front of the variable you can move the constant to the front so this is the same as 5 times the derivative of x and the derivative of x is one so five times one will give us five the derivative of let's say negative seven x is simply negative seven now what about the derivative of a constant the derivative of any constant is zero now one way that you can remember that is you can write eight as eight times x is zero because x to the zero is one and so these two they're the same so this is eight times the derivative of x raised to the zero and using the power rule it's going to be zero x raised to the zero minus one and zero times anything is zero so the whole thing is just going to be zero so make sure you remember that the derivative of any constant is always equal to zero here's another one find the derivative of nine x to the fourth and also seven x to the fifth power so this is gonna be nine times the derivative of x to the fourth which is four x raised to the 4 minus 1 or 4 x cubed and then you just got to multiply 9 times 4. so the answer is going to be 36 x to the third power for the next one it's going to be seven times the derivative of x to the fifth which is five x to the fourth power and then seven times 5 that's 35 so you get 35 x raised to the fourth power now what about the derivative of let's say a polynomial function four x to the fifth plus seven x cubed minus nine x plus five go ahead and try that so the derivative of x to the fifth is going to be 5x to the fourth power the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of x is one the derivative of a constant is zero so four times five is twenty seven times three is twenty one and this is going to be it so it's twenty x to the fourth plus twenty one x squared minus nine so you just have to differentiate each term separately now what about this one what is the derivative of the square root of x ahead and try that for this example we need to rewrite it this is x raised to the first power but within a square root symbol and the index number is a 2 if you don't see a number there and so the way you rewrite it is like this it's going to be x to the one-half now we can use the power rule so it's one-half times x raised to the one-half minus one one half minus one is the same as one over two minus two over two two divided by two is the same as one and so this becomes negative one half so we get one half x raised to the minus one-half now whenever you have a negative exponent you need to move the variable to the bottom of the fraction so we're gonna put x in the denominator of the fraction so the exponent will change from negative one-half to positive one-half and recall that x to the one-half is the same as the square root of x so at this point we can replace x to the one half with the square root of x and so this is the first derivative of that function the square root of x function let's try another radical function let's use the seventh root of x to the fourth power so the first thing we need to do is rewrite it this is going to be x raised to the four over seven and now we could use the power rule so it's four over seven times x raised to the four over seven minus one so four over seven minus one is the same as four over seven minus seven over seven which will be negative three over seven and so this is going to be 4 over 7 x raised to the negative 3 over 7. so once again we have a negative exponent which means we need to move the variable to the bottom of the fraction so the 4 is going to be on top the 7 is going to be on the bottom with the x variable and we're going to change the negative exponent to a positive exponent and then at this point we can turn it back into its radical form so it's four over seven times the seventh root of x cubed now if you want to you can rationalize the denominator but i'm not going to worry about that in this example so i'm going to leave the answer like this and so that's how you could find the derivative of a radical function now what about the derivative of a rational function like this one what is the derivative of one divided by x raised to the fifth power so once again we need to rewrite it before we could use the power rule so what we're going to do is we're going to take the x variable and move it to the top and as you do so the exponent will change sign it's going to flip from positive 5 to negative 5. so now we could use the power rule n is negative five so it's going to be negative five times x raised to the negative five minus one which is negative five x to the negative six so this is the answer but we wanna rewrite it since we have a negative exponent we're going to move the x variable back to the bottom so the final answer is going to be negative 5 over x to the sixth power and so that's how you could find the derivative of a rational function now let's talk about the derivative of trigonometric functions so here are some notes that you need to take down the derivative of sine x is cosine x and the derivative of cosine x is negative sine x next you need to know the derivative of tangent x and that's going to be secant squared now what do you think the derivative of cotangent x is equal to it's going to be negative cosecant squared now the derivative of secant x is secant x tangent x based on that what do you think the derivative of cosecant x is going to be this is going to be negative cosecant x times cotangent x and notice this pattern so anytime you have a trig function that starts with a c notice that in the derivative they all have a negative sign so that can help you to remember the derivative of the six trigonometric functions so if you know the derivative of sine tangent and secant you can easily find the derivative of cosine cotangent cosecant looking at the similar relationships between what you see on the left side and what you see on the right side now what about this one find the derivative of five sine x minus seven tangent x plus cosecant x so all we need to do is differentiate each one separately the derivative of 5 sine x is going to be 5 times the derivative of sine x which is cosine x now once you differentiate sine next we need to differentiate tangent the derivative of negative 7 tan x is going to be negative 7 times secant squared since that's the derivative of tangent and the derivative of cosecant we said it's negative cosecant cotangent and so this is the answer 5 cosine x minus 7 secant squared x minus 4 cosecant x cotangent x so that's how you could find the derivative of trigonometric functions now let's talk about the derivatives of exponential functions involving the base e here's a formula that you're going to find useful the derivative of e to the u where u is a function of x is e to the u times u prime so for instance let's say if we want to find the derivative of e to the x it's going to be e to the x so u is x times the derivative of x which is one so the answer is just e to the x based on that what is the derivative of e to the seven x go ahead and try that so it's gonna be e to the seven x times the derivative of seven x which is seven so it's 7 e to the 7x let's work on some more examples try these three examples so using this formula find the derivative of e raised to the 4x plus 3 and the derivative of e to the x squared and also the derivative of 5 e to the x cubed so for the first one it's going to be the same thing e to the 4x plus 3 and then times the derivative of 4x plus 3 which is just 4. so it's 4 e to the 4x plus 3. now for the second one it's going to be the same thing e to the x squared times the derivative of x squared which is 2x and so it's 2x e to the x squared and for the last one it's going to be what we started with times the derivative of x cubed which is 3x squared and so we could multiply 5 and 3 and that's going to give us 15 x squared e to the x cubed and so now you know how to find the derivative of exponential functions with the base e next let's talk about finding the derivative of logarithmic functions particularly the natural log function the derivative of ln u where u is once again a function of x is u prime divided by u so let's say if we want to find the derivative of ln x so in this case u is x u prime the derivative of x is one so u prime is one u is x so the answer is just one over x let's try another example let's find the derivative of the natural log of x squared plus five so u is that's the stuff inside the natural log that's x squared plus five u prime the derivative of x squared plus five is just two x so it's going to be u prime divided by u and so the answer is two x over x squared plus five for the sake of practice try this one find the derivative of three times the natural log of five x plus four so u the u variable is going to be 5 x plus 4 and u prime is the derivative of 5 x plus 4. the derivative of 5x is 5 and the derivative of the constant 4 is 0. so it's just 5. now we do have a constant in front of the natural log so we're going to rewrite that here so it's going to be 3 times this thing u prime which is 5 divided by u which is five x plus four so now we can multiply three times five and that's going to be fifteen so the answer is fifteen over five x plus 4. so now you know how to find the derivative of natural logarithmic functions now for those of you who want more example problems are not just natural logs but logarithmic functions exponential functions and other things like implicit differentiation and things like that check out the links in the description section below and i'm going to post more video resources that can help you with derivatives now the next thing we need to talk about is the product rule the best time to use the product rule is when you have two things multiplied to each other let's say u and v so what you need to do is you need to differentiate one of these two functions so if you differentiate u first leave the other one alone and then it's going to be plus we're going to leave the first function the way it is and differentiate the second one so the derivative of u times v is going to be u prime v plus uv prime i need to draw the u better so this is a u that's a v now let's work on some examples what is the derivative of x squared times sine x so in this case u is x squared which means u prime is 2x v v is going to be sine x so v prime is cosine x so it's going to be u prime times v plus u times v prime which is cosine and so this is the answer 2x sine x plus x squared cosine x now let's try another one what is the derivative of x cubed ln x so in this case we're going to say v is ln and u is x cubed so let's write that u is x cubed v is ln x u prime the derivative of x cubed is going to be three x squared and v prime the derivative of l and x is going to be one over x so it's u prime v three x squared times ln x plus u v prime x cubed times one over x now we could simplify x cubed times one over x that's the same as x cubed divided by x which is just x squared so this is the answer now if you want to you can factor out the gcf you can take out x squared and it's going to leave you with 3 ln x plus 1. so you can write your answer like this and so that's how you could use the product rule to uh differentiate certain functions now there's also the quotient rule and the chain rule but i'm not going to go over that in this video instead i'm going to post some links to some other videos where i cover those topics so
