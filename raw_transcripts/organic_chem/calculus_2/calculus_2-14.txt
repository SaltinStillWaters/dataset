Transcript for: How To Graph Radical Functions & Determine The Domain and Range
now in this lesson we're going to talk about how to graph radical functions particularly using transformations so here's the parent function of the square root of x and increases at a decrease in rate and it travels towards quadrant one now what if we put let's say a negative sign in front of it what's going to happen if we put a negative sign this is going to flip over the x-axis it reflects over the x-axis now what if we put a negative on the inside of the radical what's going to happen now relative to the original function it's going to reflect over the y-axis and this is the y-axis this is the x-axis if we have a negative on the outside and on the inside then relative to the parent function it's going to reflect over the origin so it's going to look like that now if you ever forget these things this is something that can help you this is what i use the sign that's in front of x i'm going to associate it with x the sign outside of the radical i'm going to associate it with y when x is positive you need to travel towards the right and when y is positive you need to go up which leads you to towards quadrant one now in the second example x is positive but y is negative so x is positive towards the right y is negative going down so this will take you towards quadrant four and this is quadrant one now on the third example x is negative y is positive x is negative towards the left y is positive as you go up this will take you towards quadrant two and in the last example x is negative and y is negative so that will take you towards quadrant three so you can use the signs to help determine in what direction the graph is going to travel towards now let's say if we have the square root of x minus two what's the general shape of the graph what's going to happen this graph is going to shift two units to the right if you set the inside part equal to zero x is equal to 2. that's going to be the new origin 2 comma 0. and it's going to go that one since there's a positive sign in front of the x and in front of the y so let's say if we had square root x plus three this graph will be shifted three units to the left and it's going to travel towards quadrant one now what about this one the square root of x plus one so this graph is going to go up one unit and it's going to open towards the right and if we have let's say negative square root x minus 2 this graph is gonna shift down to now instead of going towards quadrant one it's going to be reflected so it's going to go towards quadrant four it's gonna look like that due to the negative sign go ahead and graph this function the square root of x minus one plus two and also determine the domain and the range of the function so this graph is going to shift one unit to the right and up two units so the new origin is that one comma two now to find the next two points here's what you can do the parent function is the square root of x the square root of one is one so as you travel one unit to the right go up one to get the next point so that's going to be two comma three now the square root of four is equal to two so as you travel four units to the right go up two units to get the next point so this is going to be five comma three and so this is how the graph is going to look like now what's the domain and range of this graph so let's start with the domain the domain has to do with the x values the lowest x value is one the highest is infinity so the domain is going to be one to infinity and since it includes 1 we need to use a bracket now the range is associated with the y values the lowest y value is 2 the highest will be infinity so the range is from 2 to infinity let's try another example let's graph the square root of three minus x plus one so if we set the inside equal to zero we can see that x is equal to three that means that it's going to shift three units to right and because of the plus one it's gonna shift up one now we need to know what direction to go towards that is towards quadrant one towards quadrant two three or four it's going to be in one of those directions so here's how we can tell we have a negative sign in front of x and a positive sign next to y so x is negative it's going to go towards the left and y is positive it's going to go up so it's going to go in that general direction now we know that the square root of one is one so what that tells us is that as we travel one unit to the left because we need to go to the left the graph is going to go up one unit so the next point is the point positive two two now as we travel four to the left the square root of four is two it needs to go up 2 units so that will take us to the point negative 1 comma 3. and so the graph let's do that again it's going to look something like that so what's the domain and range of this function the lowest x value is negative infinity and the highest history so therefore the domain is going to be from negative infinity to 3. you always want to write it from left to right from the low x value to the highest x value now the range the lowest y value is 1 and the highest is infinity so from the lowest to the highest value it's going to be from 1 to infinity and so that's how you can write the domain and range of a radical function let's try one more example let's say y is equal to 3 minus the square root of 4 minus x feel free to graph this problem and let's put a 2 in front of the radical so first let's set four minus x equal to zero so x is four that means that the origin shifts four units to the right and because we have a plus three in front it's gonna shift up three units so the graph starts at four comma three that's the new origin now what direction is it going to travel towards towards quadrant one two three or towards quadrant 4. so we have a negative sign in front of x which means it's going to go towards the left and we have a negative sign in front of the radical which means negative y which is going to go down so it's going to go towards quadrant 3. so now that we have the direction let's go ahead and get some points now because we have a 2 in front of it everything is doubled when x changes by one y will change by two when x changes by four y will change by 4 as well so be careful with these things and if x were to change by 9 y will change by 6. so as we travel let's say one unit to the left we need to go down two units because of this instead of going down one we have to go down two the two is gonna double the change in the y value so this will take us to the point three one now as we travel four units to the left relative to the new origin the y value will decrease by four so four units will take us to an x value of zero we need to go down four which will take us to a y value of negative one so here's the next point and as we travel let's say 9 units to the left we need to go down six units so that's going to take us to the point negative five negative three so now let's go ahead and graph it now what is the domain and range of the function starting with the domain the lowest x value is negative infinity and the highest x value it stops at positive four so it's from negative infinity to four now as for the range the lowest y value is negative infinity and the highest history so it's negative infinity to three and so that's it for this example now i'm going to do one more example for those of you who like to use a table let's try this 2 square root x plus 1 minus 3. so we can see that the graph is going to shift one unit to the left and down three units so the new origin is at negative one negative three so let's plot that point first now you wanna choose x values that will lead to a perfect square so once you have your new origin the next x value that you want should be one unit away from the origin so one unit away from negative one is zero and we know that this graph is going to go towards quadrant one because x and y are both positive so you want to choose one point to the right of negative one then you want to travel four units to the right of negative one which will take you to an x value of three and if you want another point travel nine units to the right of negative one which will lead you to eight negative one plus nine is eight the reason why you want to do this is because one four and nine are perfect squares if we replace x with zero zero plus one is one the square root of one is one times two is two two minus three will give us a y value of negative one if we plug in three three plus one is four the square root of four is two times two is four minus three this is going to be one if we plug in eight a plus one is nine square root of nine is three three times two is six six minus three is three and now all we need to do is simply plot the points so the next point is zero negative one and then it's a three comma one and then eight comma three so this graph looks something like this and so the domain the lowest x value we see is negative 1 the highest is infinity the domain is going to be from negative 1 to infinity and as for the range the lowest y value is negative 3 the highest is positive infinity so it's from negative 3 to infinity and that's it
