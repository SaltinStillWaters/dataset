Transcript for: How To Find The Derivative of a Fraction - Calculus
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the derivative of a fraction but before we do that we need to go over some basic rules such as the power rule the derivative of a variable raised to a constant x is the variable n is the constant it's going to be n times x raised to the n minus 1. so let me give you some examples let's say if we want to find the derivative of x squared it's going to be 2 x and then subtract this by 1 so 2x to the first power if we want to take the derivative of x cubed it's going to be 3 x to the second power pretty much you move the exponent to the front and then subtract it by one likewise if we want to find the derivative of x to the fourth power is 4 x cubed now what if we want to find the derivative of let's say 8 x to the ninth power what you could do is move the constants to the front this is equivalent to saying 8 times the derivative of x to the 9th power and then using the power rule the derivative of x to the 9th power will be 9 x to the 8th and then you can multiply the 8 and the nine so eight times nine is seventy two so that's the answer for this example so let's say if we wanna find the derivative of five x to the sixth it's going to be five times the derivative of x to the sixth power which is six x to the fifth power and we're gonna get 30 x to the fifth now what if we want to find the derivative of let's say 7x what's the answer for that one well keep in mind this is x to the first power so it's going to be 7 times the derivative of x to the first power which is one x to the zero power and anything raised to the zero power is one so the answer is just seven so the derivative of five x is simply five the derivative of negative four x is simply negative four following that same pattern now the last thing you need to be familiar with is that the derivative of a constant is zero so the derivative of let's say negative six that's going to be zero so now that we had a quick review of some of the basic stuff let's go over finding the derivative of a fraction so let's say we want to find the derivative of x over nine how can we do this well it helps if you rewrite the fraction this is the same as the 9 is a constant so you could say this is the same as 1 over 9 times the derivative of x because 1 over 9 times x is x over nine and the derivative of x is simply one keep in mind the derivative of five x is five two x is two one x is one so the answer for this example it's simply one over nine now what about this one what is the derivative of four x over seven so this is the same as four over seven times the derivative of x so it's just four over seven times one or simply four over seven so that's what you can do if x is in the numerator but what if x is in the denominator of the fraction let's say we have the derivative of 8 over x well in this case the situation is different if you see this what you need to do is you need to rewrite the expression you need to move the x to the top of the fraction so this is the same as the derivative of eight times x raised to the minus one and now we could use the power rule we can move the exponent to the front and so it becomes eight times negative one or negative eight and then x and then subtract this by one negative 1 minus 1 is negative 2. so this is the answer but we want to get rid of the negative exponents so what we're going to do is we're going to move x back to the bottom and the negative exponent is going to become positive so we're going to get negative 8 over x squared so this is the final answer for this example let's try a similar example let's find the derivative of 7 over x squared feel free to pause the video if you want to try that problem so let's begin by rewriting the expression so this is equivalent to saying the derivative of seven times x to the minus two now we could use the power rule so it's going to be seven times the derivative of this thing the derivative of x to the minus 2 is negative 2 x and then if you subtract negative 2 by 1 you're going to get negative 3. next we can multiply 7 and negative 2 that's negative 14. and then we're going to move the negative 3 to the bottom so the answer is going to be negative 14 over x cubed here's another one let's find the derivative of eight over x to the third power so once again let's rewrite the expression so this is the same as finding the derivative of eight x to the minus three now the derivative of x to the minus three is going to be negative three times x raised to the negative four and then 8 times negative 3 is negative 24. now moving the x variable to the bottom this is going to give us the final answer negative 24 over x to the fourth power now what about this problem what is the derivative of let's say the square root of x over five so what would you do if you have a square root in the numerator of a fraction well first we want to rewrite the expression this is the same as the derivative of one over five times the square root of x is the same as x to the one-half so that's going to be one over five times the derivative of x to the one-half now let's use the power rule first we're going to move this to the front and then we're going to subtract one half by one so one half minus one we could change the negative one to two over two to get common denominators and then one minus two is negative one so one half minus one is negative one half and now we can multiply one over five by one over two so five times two is ten so we're going to get one over ten x to the minus one half which you can write that as x to the negative one half over ten you could just multiply those two together now we wanna get rid of the negative exponent to do that we need to move the variable x to the bottom so our answer is 1 over 10 x to the one-half now even though this is the correct answer it's not in its most simplified form because we need to convert it back to its radical form keep in mind x to the one-half is equivalent to the square root of x so we can write our final answer as one over ten square root of x now you can rationalize this answer but i'm going to leave it like this now let's work on a similar but slightly different problem so in this example we're going to find the derivative of 7 divided by the square root of x feel free to take a minute to try that problem so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to rewrite the problem the square root of x is the same as x to the one-half next we need to move the x variable to the top before we can use the product rule i mean not the product rule but the power rule so we have the derivative of seven times x to the negative one half so now we're going to move the negative one-half to the front and then subtract negative one-half by one let's change negative one to negative two over two just like we did before and now negative one minus two is negative three so negative one half minus one is negative three over two now let's see if we can combine this answer into a single fraction the 7 and the negative sign are on top of the fraction the 2 is on the bottom and since this fraction is multiplied by x it's automatically going to put the x on top now the next thing we need to do is get rid of the negative exponent by moving the x variable back to the bottom so this is what we now have next what we can do is get rid of we can convert this back into its radical form but it's important to understand that x to the three half can be rewritten as x to the one half times x to the first power because a half plus one is three halves or point five plus one is three over two which is one point five and x to the one half is equal to the square root of x so we can replace x to the three half with x root x so we can write the final answer as negative 7 to x times the square root of x so that's it for this problem now let's work on one more problem go ahead and find the derivative of this fraction five plus three x divided by x squared plus seven now for problems like this you need to use something called the quotient rule and here's the formula for that the derivative of a fraction f over g that's going to be equal to g f prime minus f g prime over g squared some books would use the variables u and v so in this case we need to define what f and what g is so f is the stuff in the numerator that's 5 plus 3x f prime is the derivative of that expression the derivative of a constant is zero and the derivative of three x is just three now g is the function on the bottom is the stuff in the denominator of the fraction to find g prime we need to find the derivative of x squared which is 2x and the derivative of 7 is 0. so now we just got to plug everything in to this formula so it's a g which is x squared plus seven times f prime which is three minus f which is five plus three x times g prime which is two x divided by g squared so that's x squared plus 7 squared so at this point we can get rid of this information and now we just got to simplify this expression so let's distribute the 3. so first we're going to have 3x squared and then 3 times 7 is 21. next we're going to have 2x times 5 which is 10x but we have a negative sign in front of that so that's going to be negative 10x and then 2x times 3x that's 6x squared and we still got the negative sign so it's a negative 6x squared it's always good just to double check your work to make sure that everything was done correctly now the part on the bottom i'm going to leave it the way it is i'm not going to foil it at this point all we can do right now is combine like terms chances are we probably won't be able to factor it but it's going to check to see if you could factor in but right now i have negative 3x squared minus 10x plus 21 divided by x squared plus 7 squared so just to check to see if we can factor it if we multiply the leading coefficient by the constant term that's going to be 63 or negative 63 rata and we need to find two numbers that multiply to negative 63 but add to negative 10. i mean 9 and 7 multiplies to 63 but it's not going to add to 10. and then you have 21 and 3. that's definitely not going to add to 10. and that's about it so this expression is not factorable which means we can leave our answer like this this is going to be the final answer for this problem so that's it for this video now you know how to find the derivative of a fraction
