Transcript for: Derivatives of Hyperbolic Functions
in this video we're going to focus on the derivatives of hyperbolic functions so let's start with the derivative of hyperbolic sine this is equal to hyperbolic cosine so you may want to take some notes on this we'll work on a few practice problems shortly the derivative of hyperbolic cosine is hyperbolic sine it's a little bit different from the corresponding trig function Intrigue the derivative of normal sine is just cosine but the derivative of cosine is negative sine but for hyperbolic functions the derivative of hyperbolic cosine is positive hyperbolic sine the derivative of hyperbolic tangent is hyperbolic secant squared the derivative for hyperbolic cosecant X is negative cosecant or hyperbolic cosecant times hyperbolic cotangent of x now the derivative for hyperbolic secant x that's negative hyperbolic secant times hyperbolic tangent now the derivative for cotangent is negative cosecant squared now let's prove this derivative if you recall sine hyperbolic sign it's e to the x minus E to the negative X over 2. let me make sure I have the right formula because sometimes my memory may fail me but that is the correct formulas that's hyperbolic sign and hyperbolic cosine it's the same thing but the only difference is we're going to have a plus sign instead of a minus sign so to differentiate hyperbolic sign we're differentiating that expression e to the x minus E to the negative X over two the derivative of e to the U is e to the U times U Prime so the derivative of e to the axis e to the x times the derivative of x which is one so that's just e to the x the derivative of e to the negative X is e to the negative x times the derivative of negative X which is negative one so we get that so this becomes e to the x these two negative signs they cancel so it's plus e to the negative X over two which is what we have here and that is equivalent to hyperbolic cosine so that's how you can prove this particular derivative now let's work on some practice problems go ahead and differentiate hyperbolic sine of 4X and also hyperbolic cosine of X cubed feel free to pause the video as you work on this the derivative of hyperbolic sine of U where U is a function of X as opposed to just X this is going to be hyperbolic cosine of U times the derivative of the inside or U Prime so for this this is going to be hyperbolic cosine we'll keep the inside part the same 4X times the derivative of 4X which is 4. so it's four hyperbolic cosine of 4X so that's how we can find the value of that derivative for the next one the derivative of hyperbolic cosine we know it's hyperbolic sine we'll keep the inside the same and now we need to take the derivative of the inside the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared so we can write the answer as 3x squared hyperbolic sign of X cubed now let's try some more examples go ahead and find the derivative of hyperbolic secant x to the fourth and let's try the derivative of x squared hyperbolic sine of x try those two examples so for the first one we just have to use the chain rule the derivative of secant is secant tan but with a negative sign so we're going to have hyperbolic well negative secant times x to the fourth and then times hyperbolic tangent x to the fourth and then we need to differentiate the inside part the derivative of x to the fourth is four x cubed so we can rewrite this as negative 4X cubed hyperbolic secant x to the fourth times hyperbolic tangent x to the fourth all right so moving to the next one we have the product rule and if you recall here's the product rule so if we have F times G we want to find the derivative of that it's going to be F Prime G Plus f g Prime so this is f and hyperbolic sine is G so F Prime the derivative of x squared is going to be 2X times G we'll keep that the same and then plus F which is just x squared times G Prime the derivative of hyperbolic sine which is going to be hyperbolic cosine so that is the answer for the second example now let's try a natural log problem go ahead and find the derivative of Ln hyperbolic sign of x and try this as well the derivative of Ln hyperbolic cosine of x squared now just review when you're finding the derivative of outline U where U is a function of X it's going to be U Prime over U so in this example for the first one U is just hyperbolic sine of x U Prime is the derivative of hyperbolic sine which is cosine so U Prime over U this is going to be hyperbolic cosine over hyperbolic sine and cosine over sine that is cotangent so the final answer is hyperbolic cotangent of x now for the next one we see that U is hyperbolic cosine of x squared U Prime the derivative of that is going to be the derivative of hyperbolic cosine is hyperbolic sine we'll keep the inside part the same and then take the derivative of the inside part which is 2X so U Prime over u u Prime is 2X hyperbolic sine of x squared and then divided by U the U variable so that's hyperbolic cosine of x squared and sine over cosine we can make that tangent so the final answer is going to be 2x times hyperbolic tangent of x squared so those are some simple ways in which you can differentiate hyperbolic functions as you can see the rules are very similar to differentiating other functions using the product rule the quotient Rule and the chain rule
