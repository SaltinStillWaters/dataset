Transcript for: Newton's Method
in this lesson we're going to focus on newton's method for approximating zeros of a function so let's say if we have this function f of x and it's equal to x cubed minus four x squared plus one now there could be at least three solutions to this equation we're going to focus on finding just one of them so we have to guess a value for x we have to pick a value to start with so let's see what the function value is when x is zero so f of zero is going to be one now let's pick the next best number let's try one so this is gonna be one to the third minus four times one squared plus one so that's one minus four plus one one minus four is negative three plus one this is negative two so going from zero to one notice that the y value changes from positive to negative and since this is a continuous function at some point it had to across zero so one solution to this equation that is if we set it equal to zero x has to be somewhere between zero and one there's some value of x where y will equal zero so let's solve this equation so if x cubed minus four x squared plus one is equal to zero what is the value of x so pick a number between zero and one we're going to start with point five that's going to be our first iteration now using newton's method it helps you to calculate the next zero given the first one so x raised to the or x sub n plus one is equal to x sub n minus f of x sub n divided by f prime of x sub n so using the first 0.5 this equation will help us to get a more accurate zero or more accurate solution to the equation so if n is 1 n plus 1 is going to be 2. so we have this expression so x2 is going to equal x1 minus well x1 is 0.5 and then minus f of 0.5 divided by f prime of 0.5 so let's figure out what f of 0.5 is so this is going to be 0.5 raised to the third power minus 4 times point five squared plus one so let's use a calculator for that so this is equal to 0.125 now we need to find the first derivative the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of 4x squared is 8x so now with the first derivative we need to plug in 0.5 as well so this is going to be 3 times 0.5 squared minus 8 times 0.5 so this will give you negative 3.25 now let's plug in everything into this equation so f of 0.5 0.125 and f prime of 0.5 is negative 3.25 so the two negative signs will cancel so it's 0.5 plus 0.125 divided by 3.25 and so this will give us x2 and so that's going to be 0.5385 so now we need to do another iteration so i'm going to rewrite the first derivative here because we're going to use it again so x3 is going to equal x2 minus f of x2 over f prime of x2 so x2 in this example is 0.5385 so let's evaluate the function at x2 so f of 0.5385 let's plug it in into this equation so go ahead and type in your calculator and let's see what that's going to give us 0.5385 raised to the third power minus 4 times 0.5385 squared plus 1. make sure you type in everything correctly if you make one mistake the whole problem is ruined so this is negative point zero zero three seven seven four you might see it as three point seven seven four times ten to the minus three but it's the same and now let's do the same for the first derivative so we're going to plug it in to this equation so it's going to be 3 times 0.5385 squared minus 8 times 0.5385 so you should get negative 3.4 3 so now we can plug these values into that expression so x3 is going to be 0.5385 minus and then f of 0.5385 that's negative 0.00374 and then we need to divide that by negative 3.4381 now notice that this answer is close to zero that means x the solution that we're looking for where the function has a y value of zero is close to this number so x3 shouldn't be too far away from x2 now these two negative signs will cancel so overall we'll still have a negative sign so this is going to be 0.5385 minus 0.00374 divided by 3.43 81 so you should get this answer 0.5374 which is very close to x2 so chances are because the answer is so close that means that this is a good estimation and let's check in we're going to do is plug it into this expression and see if we get an answer that's very very close to zero if we do then we could say this is the solution to the equation or at least it's one of the solutions so let's evaluate f of 0.5374 let's see if it's equal to zero so go ahead and type that in to your calculator so i got 5.41 three six times ten to the minus six so that's very small that's basically point zero zero zero zero zero five four one three six so we could say that is approximately zero which means the solution is 0.5374 that's one of the solutions to this equation and so that's how you can use the newton's method to solve functions you can approximate zeros of the function just by picking a value that's close to the actual zero if the value is too far away you may have some issues with newton's method but if you want to pick a number that's close to the actual zero and using multiple iterations with newton's method each time you do it you're gonna get an answer that's even closer to the real answer so if you do it two or three times it's usually good and as you can see we only had to do it two times for this example so hopefully this gave you a better understanding of how to use newton's method to solve zeros or find zeros of a function so that's it for this video thanks again for watching and have a good day you
