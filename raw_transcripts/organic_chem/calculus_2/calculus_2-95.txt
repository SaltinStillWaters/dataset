Transcript for: Logarithmic Differentiation Formula - Calculus
what is the derivative of x rais to the X what is the answer to that question in order to find the answer we need to use a process called logarithmic differentiation now in the past I've created other videos explaining how to do that but in this particular video instead of going through the process I'm just going to give you a formula that'll help you go straight to the answer by the way if you want to see those older videos that explains the process to get the answer feel free to check out the links in the description section below it's going to include these examples that you see here today so let's begin here's the formula you need to use the derivative of U raised to the V is equal to U raised to V * v u Prime over u+ V Prime Ln U so in this example both u and v are equal to X so U Prime and V Prime they're both one in this case so U raised to V is going to be the same thing that we have here x raised to the x X and then v v is x * U Prime which is 1 / U which is X Plus V Prime V Prime is 1 * Ln U where U is X so X overx is just 1 so the answer is X raised to the x * 1 + Ln X Again the video in the description has this example it shows you how to go from point A to point B but this formula will take you straight there now let's move on to the next example let's say we want to find the derivative of x raised to the sinx feel free to pause the video if you want to try this example I'm just going to rewrite the formula real quick so the derivative of U raised to the V is U to the V time v u Prime / U plus v Prime Ln U so first we need to determine u and v u is x v is sin x U Prime the derivative of x is 1 V Prime the derivative of sin x is cine X so now we just got to put it into the formula so U raised to the V it's X raised to the sin x which is always what we start with times v u Prime so V is sin x u Prime is 1 over u u is S Plus V Prime which is cosine time Ln u u is X so Ln U is Ln X so this is the answer it's X ra to sinx * sin XX + cosine x * l x that's all we could do for that feel free to try this problem go ahead and find the derivative of Ln X raised to the X so in this case U is going to be Ln x v is X U Prime the derivative of Ln X is 1 /x V Prime is going to be 1 so U rais to the V it's going to be Ln X rais to X the original problem and then v u Prime so V is X U Prime is 1 /x / u u is Ln X and then plus v Prime which is 1 * Ln u u being Ln X so it's Ln Ln X now we could simplify this 1 /x * X these will cancel to one so this is going to be Ln X ra to x * 1/ Ln x + Ln Ln X so that's going to be the answer for this problem try this one the derivative of x raised to the Ln X so it's basically in Reverse U this time is x v V is Ln X so U Prime is going to be 1 V Prime is 1 /x so it's going to be the original problem X raised to the Ln X and then v u Prime so V is Ln X U Prime is 1 over u u is X Plus V Prime so V Prime is 1 /x and then Ln U where U is X so that's just Ln X so we get a completely different answer now here this is lnx overx and this is Ln X overx we can add them and get two Ln X overx so we can simplify our answer like this x rais to the Ln x * 2 Ln X overx so that's going to be the final answer now let's try this one the derivative of x raised to the E to X by the way for those of you who want a formula sheet with a list of derivatives that you may need to know if you're upcoming tests feel free to check out the links in the description section below I have a formula sheet where you can access these derivative formulas now for this one U let's define U as X and v as the exponent e to the X so U Prime is going to be 1 the derivative of e to X is just e to the X so that's V Prime so it's U to the V so that's the original problem and then v u Prime so V is e to the X U Prime is 1 over U which is X Plus V Prime which is e to x * Ln U so that's Ln X so now let's see if we can simplify this in both cases we have an e to the X so we could factor out the GCF so it's x e to the X if we take out e x we're left with 1 /x plus Ln X and I'm going to put that HDX in the front here on the right side so that's the answer for this particular problem let's do one more go ahead and find the derivative of sin x raised to the X so we're going to make U equal to S V is going to be X U Prime is going to be cosine V Prime is going to be 1 so it's U to the V the original problem sin x rais to X time v u Prime so V is X U Prime is cine X over u u being sin x plus v Prime which is 1 * Ln u u is s now cosine over s we can make that into cotangent so we can write the final answer as sin x rais x * X Cent X plus the natural log of sinx so that's it for uh that particular problem so now you know how to perform logarith aric differentiation you know how to get the answer using this particular formula
