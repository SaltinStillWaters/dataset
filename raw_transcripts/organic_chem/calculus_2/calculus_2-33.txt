what is the limit as X approaches 4 of < TK x - 2 over x - 4 so what should you do under these circumstances we can't Factor this expression so how can we simplify if we plug in four 4 - 4 is zero the function will be undefined so we can't use direct substitution we don't want a zero in the bottom whenever you have a radical what you need to do is multiply by the conjugate the conjugate of otk x - 2 is the < TK of x + 2 and whatever you do to the top you must also do to the bottom so on top we're going to foil x * X or rather the square < TK of x * the otk of X is the < TK of x^2 which simplifies to X and then rootx * 2 that's going to be positive2 < tkx these 2 that's going to produce -2 < tkx and finally -2 * -2 is -4 now on the bottom we're not going to foil we're simply going to rewrite it exactly the way it is now 2un x + 2un X these two cancel and so we'll left with the limit as X approaches 4 of x - 4 / x - 4 * the < TK of x + 2 so now these two expressions will cancel and so we're left with the limit as X approaches 4 of 1 / the square root of x + 2 so at this point we can use direct substitution so that's going to be equal to 1 / the < TK 4 + 2 which theun of 4 is 2 so we have 2 + 2 which is 4 so the final answer is 1 over 4 let's work on another problem what is the limit as X approaches Z of the < TK x + 2 - < tk2 / X so we can't plug in zero otherwise we'll get a zero in the bottom so we got to get rid of that X somehow so just like before we're going to multiply the top and a bottom by the conjugate of the numerator so on top let's foil so when we multiply these two the sare otk of x + 2 * the square root of x + 2 that's simply going to equal x + 2 and then if we multiply these two together we're going to have < tk2 * < TK x + 2 I'm just going to leave it like that and if we multiply these two we can see that the middle terms will cancel and finally < tk2 * POS < tk2 isun 4 which is -2 on the bottom don't distribute simply rewrite it the way it is now these two terms will add up to zero positive2 and negative -2 adds up to zero so now what we have left over is this expression at this point we can cancel X and once the X in the bottom is gone we can now use direct substitution in The Next Step so this is going to be let's make some space so this is equal to 1 over < TK 0 + 2 + < tk2 0 + 2 is 2 now what is the square < TK of 2 plus the < TK of two the coefficient in front of both of them is 1 1 + 1 is 2 so this is going to be 1 over 2 < tk2 now that's your final answer but you could rationalize it if you want to so let's multiply the top and the bottom byun2 the < TK of two * the < TK of two is 2 and 2 * 2 is 4 so it's going to be < tk2 ID 4 that is the final answer now let's talk about the limit of rational functions let's say if we want to find the limit as X approaches 3 of 1x - 1 3 / xus 3 how can we do so as we could see we cannot use direct substitution and the denominator is going to be 3 - 3 which is zero and it will be undefined so what should we do under these circumstances what we need to do is we need to multiply the top and the Bottom by the common denominator of of these two fractions which is going to be 3x notice what happens if we do so so let's distribute 3x * 1 /x is equal to 3 3x is the same as 3x over 1 these will cancel and you'll be left with three so we're going to have a three on top and then 3x * 1 3 the 3es cancel leaving behind an X now we're not going to distribute the 3x on the bottom we're just going to leave it in its factored form and let's not forget to rewrite the limit expression now notice that 3 - x is similar to x - 3 but it's not exactly the same so what we need to do is we need to factor out the GCF in this case negative 1 if we take out negative 1 and reverse 3 and XGA X will become positive X and positive3 will change tog3 so now at this point we can cancel xus 3 so we're left with the limit as X approaches zero I mean not Zer but 3 of -1 over 3x and now we can use direct substitution so it's -1 / 3 * 3 and so the final answer is -1/ 9 let's try another similar example for the sake of practice so this time we're going to have the limit as X approaches Z 1 / x + 2 minus 1/ 2 / X so go ahead and and try this problem so notice that the common denominator between these two fractions is x + 2 * 2 so let's multiply the top and the Bottom by x + 2 and 2 so now if we distribute these two will cancel leaving behind a two so we're going to have the limit as X approaches zero with a two on top and when we multiply these two this time the twos will cancel leaving behind X+ 2 with a negative sign in front of it on the bottom we're going to have an x a two and an X plus2 we're not going to distribute anything on the bottom now let's distribute the negative sign on top to uh these two terms so now we have the limit as X approaches zero and that's going to be 2 - x - 2 / 2x * x + 2 so positive2 and negative -2 will add up to zero so we can get rid of those two now now in the next step we can cancel something else notice that we can get rid of an X once we get rid of the X on the bottom we can now substitute at this point so we have -1 / 2 * x + 2 so this is equal to 1 / 2 * 0 + 2 which is 0 + 2 is the same as 2 and 2 * 2 is 4 so the final answer is -1 / 4 for
