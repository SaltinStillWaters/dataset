Transcript for: The Constant Rule For Derivatives
in this lesson we're going to go over the constant rule for derivatives so the derivative of a constant c is equal to zero when you see this expression it means that you're differentiating c with respect to x so let's say for example if we want to differentiate five the derivative of five is equal to zero the derivative of a constant like negative seven is equal to zero so there's no variables attached to it it's going to be zero so for example let's say if y is equal to 24 the derivative of y which is y prime that's going to be zero let's say if f of x is equal to pi pi is not a variable it's a constant so the derivative of that function which is denoted f prime of x that's going to be zero now let's say if y was equal to e e is a constant so y prime will be zero so make sure you know which numbers are constants and which ones are not but if you see a number by itself or if you see pi or e those are constants and the derivative of any constant is zero but now let's prove that so let's say if we have a function and it's equal to eight let's show that f prime of x is equal to zero and let's use the definition of the derivative to show this so we know that f prime of x is equal to the limit as h approaches zero for f of x plus h minus f of x divided by h now if f of x is eight what is f of x plus h everywhere we see an x we need to replace it with x plus h because there's no x f of x plus h will simply be eight so we have the limit as h approaches zero eight and f of x is also eight divided by h so eight minus eight is zero so we have the limit as h approaches zero zero over h zero divided by h is zero so the whole thing is zero therefore the derivative of any constant will always be zero as you can see these two will be the same so thus we have the constant rule the derivative of some constant c will be equal to zero you
