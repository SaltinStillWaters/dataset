Transcript for: Rectilinear Motion Problems - Distance, Displacement, Velocity, Speed & Acceleration
consider this problem a ball is thrown downward with an initial speed of 20 feet per second from an 800 foot cliff and we're given the acceleration due to gravity write a function for a of t that is the acceleration with respect to time now the acceleration due to gravity it's a fixed number and so a of t is simply equal to negative 32. it doesn't depend on time it's always the same now let's move on to part b what is the velocity of the ball at t equals zero well if we draw a picture let's say this is the building and here's the ball the ball is not released from rest it's thrown down with an initial speed of 20 feet per second so we could say that v0 is what v zero is negative twenty not positive twenty the speed of the ball is positive twenty but the velocity is negative twenty because velocity is dependent on direction the ball is going in a negative y direction so that's why it has to be negative so that's the answer for part b v of 0 is negative 20. now what about part c write a function for v of t what we need to do is we need to integrate this function so the anti-derivative of a of t dt that's going to equal the anti-derivative of negative 32 with respect to time now you need to know that the anti-derivative of the acceleration function will give you the velocity function and now we need to find the indefinite integral of negative 32 so that's going to be negative 32 t plus some constant c now we need to use the initial condition to find the value of c so let's replace t with zero v of zero is negative 20. negative 32 times zero is zero so we can see that c is negative 20. so the velocity function is going to be negative 32 t we have this part all we need to do is replace c with negative 20. so that's the velocity function we no longer need the acceleration function what is the speed of the ball at t equal four for part d well first we need to evaluate v of four so that's going to be negative 32 times 4 minus 20. now 30 times 4 is 120 because 3 times 4 is 12 and 2 times 4 is 8 so 32 times 4 is 128 minus 120 that's equal to negative 148. now what does this number represent it's negative 148 feet per second v of t gives you the velocity of the function remember the ball is going down so the velocity is negative but the speed is always positive speed is the absolute value of velocity so the speed at t equals 4 is going to be the absolute value of v of 4 and so that's going to be positive 148 feet per second so this is the answer for part d because we're looking for the speed and not the velocity now let's move on to part e what is the value of s of zero so what is the position of the ball at t equals zero now if you recall the ball was thrown downward from an 800 foot cliff so the initial position of the ball keep in mind s of t represents the position function is 800 feet the ball was 800 feet above ground level at the beginning of this problem so we could say that s of zero is 800 feet so now let's move on to part f calculate the distance traveled and the displacement of the ball in the first five seconds using vft the displacement is basically the difference between a position of one point and a position of another so the displacement is the final position minus the initial position which is basically s b minus s8 now it's important to understand that the position function is the antiderivative of the velocity function so if you want to write the position function you need to find the indefinite integral of v of t dt now if you want to find displacement you need to evaluate the definite integral of v of t dt from a to b so this will give you s of t evaluated from a to b which is the same as s of b minus s of a and that will give you the displacement of the ball now distance and displacement will be the same if the ball travels in one direction in this case it's not changing direction it's falling down straight so the distance and displacement will have the same magnitude however they will not have the same sign as the ball falls downward in the negative y direction displacement like velocity their vectors so they can be negative distance and speed will be positive so let's say the displacement was negative 200 meters the distance will be positive 200 meters the only time these two will vary in terms of magnitude is if the direction changes for example let's say if we travel five feet to the right and then eight feet to left the total distance traveled is five plus eight that's thirteen but the displacement is five plus negative eight which is negative three this is negative because it's going to the left this is positive because it's going to the right so the displacement will be negative three because the net change is negative three to the left if you go from the initial position to the final position you traveled a net of three feet to the left so that's the displacement but the total distance you actually traveled is five plus eight or 13. now let's go ahead and calculate the displacement so it's going to be the definite integral of the velocity function from a to b and so it's for the first five seconds that's from zero to five and the velocity function is negative 32 t minus 20. so that's going to be negative 32 t squared divided by 2 minus 20 t evaluated from 0 to 5. now negative 32 divided by 2 is negative 16. so s of 5 is going to be negative 16 times 5 squared minus 20 times 5. now typically there would be a constant c but we really don't have to worry about it if you're evaluating a definite integral so with the constant c that would become s of 5 but we're not going to worry about the constant since it's going to cancel and then minus now we need to plug in 0 so that's going to be negative 16 times 0 squared minus 20 times 0. now 5 squared is 25 and 25 times 16 that's 400 so we have negative four hundred and twenty times five is a hundred and then everything here is zero so negative four hundred minus one hundred is negative five hundred so this is the displacement the ball went down 500 feet in the first five seconds now the distance is positive 500 feet but the displacement is the negative 500 feet distance and displacement will have the same magnitude if the ball travels in one direction and if it doesn't change direction now let's move on to part g write a function for s of t the position function of the ball with respect to the ground in the y direction so what we need to do is find the antiderivative of v of t the antiderivative of v of t that is the velocity function will give us the position function so it's going to be negative 32 t squared over 2 which we know it's negative 16 t squared minus 20 t plus some constant c now we need to find the value of this constant and you can see it right here it's 800 if you replace t with zero this is going to be negative 16 times zero squared minus 20 times zero plus c s of zero is 800 and zero squared 20 times zero that's all zero so we can see that c is eight hundred so therefore the position function s of t is going to be negative 16 t squared minus 20 t plus 800 and so this is the answer for part g part h how long will it take for the ball to hit the ground well let's find out so the ball will hit the ground when the position function is equal to zero and we're asking how long so we're talking about time so we need to find the value of t when s is zero so let's replace s of t with zero and let's solve for t now first let's simplify this function so we can divide everything by negative 4. we're going to have to use the quadratic equation to calculate the value of t negative 16 divided by negative 4 is positive 4. negative 20 divided by negative 4 is positive 5 and 800 divided by negative 4 let's uh see what that's going to be so that's a negative 200 and so now let's use the quadratic formula so t is equal to negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac divided by 2a so in this example a is 4 b is 5 c is negative 200 we have the quadratic equation already in standard form so this is going to be negative 5 plus or minus b squared which is 5 squared so that's 25 minus 4 times a times c and 2 times a that's going to be 2 times 4 which is eight now 25 minus four times four times negative two hundred that's going to be positive three thousand two hundred and twenty-five so let's take the square root of that number so that becomes fifty-six 56.79 divided by eight now we have two possible answers plus or minus if we use the minus sign we're going to get a negative answer for t so we don't want that let's use the positive sign so t is going to be negative 5 plus 56.79 divided by 8. so you should get 6.47 seconds so that's how long it's going to take approximately for the ball to hit the ground so if you plug this in to s of t you should get approximately zero let's see negative 16 times 6.47 squared minus 20 times 6.47 plus 800. i got point eight two five six which is close to zero but keep in mind this is a routed answer it was really like six point four seven three something and this also is a rounded value so just keep that in mind if you use the exact answer this is going to equal zero now let's move on what is the speed of the ball just before it hits the ground now we know that speed is the absolute value of velocity and we have the time it takes just before it hits the ground now i'm going to use a more accurate answer which is going to be 6.4738 if you take that answer and plug it into this you should get a number like negative .037 which is very close to zero so let's plug it into this expression so we have the absolute value of negative 32 times 6.4738 minus 20. and so that's going to be negative 227.2 and the final answer is going to be positive 227.2 and that's around the answer and that's feet per second so that's how fast the ball is moving just before it hits the ground and so that's it for this video hopefully it gave you a good understanding of calculus along with some physics problems like position function and velocity functions and acceleration functions you
