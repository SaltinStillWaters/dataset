Transcript for: Graphs of Inverse Hyperbolic Functions
in this lesson we're going to talk about how we can graph the inverse hyperbolic functions so if you already know how to graph the regular hyperbolic functions all you need to do to graph the inverse hyperbolic functions is you need to reflect the original graph across the line Y equals X so we're going to talk about how to do that so here's a rough sketch of the regular hyperbolic sine function to sketch the inverse of that what we want to do is we want to we want to draw the line Y equals X my graph is not perfect but we'll draw a rough sketch of that so the blue line that's going to be the inverse hyperbolic sine function now the regular hyperbolic sine function it has the domain rival numbers the domain of the regular function becomes the range of the inverse function so the range is going to be Orville numbers the range of the regular hyperbolic sine function is also horrible numbers and that will become the domain of the inverse hyperbolic sine function now let's look at another example so let's focus on hyperbolic cosine hyperbolic cosine has a minimum value at y equals one however it's not a once one function because it doesn't pass the horizontal line test so when we're graphing the inverse function we're only going to plot this side of it so notice that this has an a y-intercept of one the inverse function will have an x-intercept of one now if we were to take the inverse of this whole thing it would look something like this but this is not a function because it doesn't pass the vertical line test so we're only going to take this half of it and we can draw the line Y equals X and we can see this side is a reflection of this side across the line Y equals X so this blue curve that is the inverse of cosine the red curve that is the regular hyperbolic cosine function the domain for the hyperbolic cosine function is all real numbers and the range we see the lowest y value is one the highest is infinity the range of the hyperbolic cosine function becomes the domain of the inverse hyperbolic cosine function we can see that the domain it goes from positive one to Infinity now the range is going to be restricted because we didn't draw the entire version of this just one half of it so we're going to have to restrict the range and we could see the lowest y value is zero and this goes up to positive Infinity so it's going to be from 0 to Infinity now let's focus on tangent let's draw the graph of the regular hyperbolic tangent function and it looks like this it's finally between the asymptotes y equal negative one and y equal 1. so that is hyperbolic tangent now to draw the inverse of that it's important to know that the horizontal asymptotes will become vertical asymptotes so instead of horizontal asymptotes at y equal negative one and y equal 1. we're going to get vertical asymptotes at x equals negative one and that x equals one so this graph is going to look like this all of the X values have been switched with Y values so for instance as X goes to Infinity y approaches 1. if we switch that as y approaches Infinity X goes to 1. now the domain for hyperbolic tangent is all real numbers so the range for hyperbolic inverse tangent is going to be our real numbers the range for regular hyperbolic tangent we could see it's bounded between the two horizontal asymptotes the domain for hyperbolic tangent will be bonded between the two vertical asymptotes and that's going to be negative one to one now let's move on to cosecant so here is the graph for hyperbolic cosecant in this graph we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero and the vertical asymptote at x equals zero because these are the same if you were to flip them it won't change for the inverse function and even if you were to draw the line Y equals X if we reflected this side across the line Y equals X it will become this side and if we reflect this side across it it becomes that side so for this particular graph cosecant and inverse cosecant will have the same shape so that is the graph for hyperbolic inverse cosecant they have the same domain negative Infinity to zero Union zero to infinity and they have the same range negative Infinity is zero Union zero to Infinity now let's talk about secant so this is the graph of hyperbolic secant it has a domain of all real numbers and a range from 0 including one go into and include in one now if we were to draw the inverse of that if we were to flip the graph it would look something like this however this function is not a once one function it doesn't pass the horizontal line test and so this won't pass the vertical line test therefore we have to restrict it to the upper half of the graph so only this side notice that we have a y-intercept of one so here we're going to have an x-intercept of one so that is the graph of inverse secant we only have this side but as we go as X goes towards positive Infinity we could see Y is approaching zero here it's going to flip as y approaches positive Infinity X goes to zero along the y axis X is zero so you can see how X and Y they're switched here now what can we say about the domain and range the range goes from zero to one and when we switch it the domain will be the same it's going from zero to one and we can see it here the lowest x value is zero the highest is one but it doesn't include zero but it does include one so we should have a bracket at one now the range is going to be different because we don't have the entire graph we just have half of it so the range is going to be half of the domain so the range is going to be 0 to Infinity that's half of this but zero is included y can be zero right here so we have a bracket at zero now let's move on to our next one and that is hyperbolic cotangent of x this function has two horizontal asymptotes this one is going to be at y equals one and Y equals negative one this function also has a vertical asymptote at x equals zero and it has this shape now if we were to reflect this shape across the line Y equals X this side is going to look like that side so the inverse function is going to have the same shape here however there are some differences the horizontal asymptotes will become vertical asymptotes and the vertical asymptote will become a horizontal asymptote so because we have two horizontal asymptotes we're going to have two vertical asymptotes instead of one and negative 1 for y it's going to be 1 and negative 1 for x so this one is at x equals negative one this one is at x equals positive one now the vertical asymptote at x equals zero will become a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero X and Y will be switched but now this part will be the same so that is the graph of hyperbolic inverse hyperbolical tangent now for cotangent the domain is negative Infinity to zero Union zero to Infinity so looking at it from left to right all we have to do is remove the vertical asymptote the domain for a hyperbolic cotangent will become the range for our inverse hyperbolical tangent so that's negative Infinity to zero Union zero to Infinity so looking at the Y values all we need to remove is the horizontal asymptote y equals zero now the range for regular hyperbolic cotangent we need to remove everything in the middle between the two horizontal asymptotes so negative one to one so the bottom half here is going to be negative infinity and it's going to stop at negative one and the top half will continue from one and go to positive Infinity now the range will become the domain for this function it's going to be negative Infinity to negative one Union One to Infinity so for the X values here it's negative infinity and here we stop at negative one the first vertical asymptote for this second part we're going to start back up at positive one and go to positive Infinity as we can see here so that's basically it for the graphs of the inverse hyperbolic functions
