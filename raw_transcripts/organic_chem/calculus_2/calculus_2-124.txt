Transcript for: Finding The Linearization of a Function Using Tangent Line Approximations
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the linearization of a function at a certain value so let's try this problem let's say that f of x is equal to x cubed and we want to find the linearization at a equals two so basically what we really are trying to do is we're looking for the tangent line equation when x is two that's the basic idea of what we're doing and you could use this formula l of x is equal to f of a plus f prime of a times x minus a now what is f of a and we know a is two so f of two we just got to plug it into this equation and that's gonna be two to the third power so two times two times two that's eight now we need to calculate f prime of a or f prime of 2. to do that we need to find the first derivative so the derivative of x cubed using the power rule is 3x squared and so f prime of 2 is going to be 3 times 2 squared 2 times 2 is 4 times 3 that's 12. so once you have f of a and f prime of a you're now ready to plug in everything into this equation so l of x is going to be f of a which is 8 plus f prime of a which is 12 times x minus a and a is 2. now at this point all we need to do is simplify this equation so let's distribute 12 to x minus 2. but first i need to make some space so let me get rid of a few things so it's going to be 8 and then 12 times x and then 12 times negative 2 which is negative 24. and so 8 minus 24 that's negative 16. so l of x is going to be 12x minus 16. so this is the linearization of the function when a is two so that's the equation of the tangent line when x is two now one good thing of linearization is it helps us to approximate certain values for instance let's say if we wanted to calculate or estimate the value of 1.99 raised to the third power without a calculator this would not be fun now let's use a calculator so 1.99 to the third power if you type that in it's eight eight zero five nine nine that is the exact answer but we can approximate this value using the linearization function at this particular number so it's going to be 12 times 1.99 minus 16. now let's see if we can do this without a calculator because if we have access to a calculator we could simply type this in so let me just get rid of this stuff so what is 12 times 1.99 without a calculator 1.99 is 2 minus 0.01 and so twelve times two is twenty four and twelve times point zero one is point twelve now twenty four minus sixteen is eight and eight minus point twelve is seven point eight eight because a hundred minus twelve is eighty eight so notice how close these two values are so if you need to approximate some number that is difficult to do without a calculator and if you know the function in this case it's x cubed you can approximate it with a linearization technique without the use of a calculator and so that's how this information can be applied in a typical setting now let's try another problem by the way if you want to see a graph this is the right side of the graph of x cube and the tangent line is basically a line that touches the curve at one point and so you can estimate a certain function value by using the tangent line and the estimation works if the number is close to the point of intersection in this case a was two and so we wanted to estimate 1.99 raised to the third power the reason why it works so well is because 1.99 is very close to two and so this point here the point of intersection that's at x equals 2. so you can use l of x to approximate function values when x is very very close to 2 because that's where the tangent line meets the curve if you try to approximate let's say 2.99 you can't use two as a value you have to use three so you need to create a new tangent line when x is 3 and so basically whenever you want to estimate a number using this process these two numbers have to be very close otherwise the accuracy will be lost you won't get a good estimation now let's try this problem let's say that f of x is equal to the square root of x and a is 4. so find the linearization l of x of the function at the given a value in addition once you have that use it to estimate the square root of 3.99 so first let's determine f of a or f of 4. so f of 4 that's the square root of 4 that's equal to 2. next we need to determine f prime of a so first we need to calculate f prime of x now f of x which is the square root of x if we rewrite that that's x to the one-half so using the power rule it's going to be one-half x to the one-half minus one which is negative one-half and then if we bring the x to the bottom it's gonna be one over two x to the one-half which is the same as one over two square root x so now f prime of 2 i mean f prime of 4 rather because a is 4. that's going to be 1 over 2 times the square root of 4. and the square root of 4 is 2 and 2 times 2 is 4. so f prime of a is 1 over 4 in this example so now let's rewrite the linearization function l of x and we said that was f of a plus f prime of a times x minus a so f of a in red is two f prime of a is highlighted in blue that's one over four and a is this number which is 4. so that is the linearization function and you could simplify if you want to but when estimating this number i'm going to use this form now if you want to simplify this is what you're going to get it's going to be 2 plus 1 4 x and then 1 4 times negative 4 that's going to be negative 1. and so 2 minus 1 is 1. so it's going to be 1 plus 1 4 x so that's the simplified version of l of x that's what it equals now let's estimate the square root of 3.99 so first let's get the exact answer with a calculator so if you type it in this is equal to one point nine nine seven four nine eight four three six those are the numbers that my calculator gave me so now let's use l of x now you have to decide if it's easier to use this form or in this form what do you think i think it might be easier to use this form but in the end i mean both will still be the same so let's calculate l of 3.99 so it's going to be 2 plus 1 4 times 3.99 minus 4. now 3.99 minus 4 that's negative 0.01 now 1 over 4 as a fraction or rather as a decimal is 0.25 now if you're not sure about that you can use long division anytime you need to convert a fraction to a decimal so the numerator goes on the inside now four goes into one zero times so we need to add a zero on the decimal point four goes into ten two times four times two is eight and four times point two is point eight ten minus eight is two add a zero four goes into twenty five times with no remainder i'm run out of space so you get 0.25 so we have 0.25 times negative 0.01 now what is 0.25 times 0.01 let me help you to understand it so 0.25 times 1 is equal to itself if we multiply by 0.1 it's going to be 0.025 we just got to move the decimal point and then if you multiply by 0.01 you got to move the decimal point by 2 spaces so it's going to be 0.00 which is what we're going to have so this is 2 minus 0.0025 two minus point zero zero two five that's going to be one point nine nine seven five for those of you who are not sure you can subtract these numbers the old-fashioned way so this is two and we're going to subtract it by point zero zero two five so first we need to borrow a one so that this becomes ten now we need to take away a one from this one so this becomes a nine a nine and a nine so ten minus five is five nine minus two is seven nine minus zero is nine nine minus zero that's nine again one minus zero is one now if we compare these two numbers 1.9975 and if you look at this portion 1.99749 this part right here you can round that to 1.9 so this is a good approximation of that number and so linearization is very useful for estimating values that look like that you
