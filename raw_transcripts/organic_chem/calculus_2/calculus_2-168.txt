Transcript for: Finding The Area Under The Curve Using Definite Integrals - Calculus
let's start with this problem find the area of the region bounded by the curve y = x^2 from X = 0 to x = 3 now before we work on this problem let's go over some generic formulas let's say we have a graph and we have a function and let's say this is point a and point B and we want to find find the area underneath this curve in other words you want to find the area between this curve and the x axis and let's say this curve is y = f ofx to determine the area under the curve it's going to be the integral from A to B of f ofx DX so we just got to find the value of the definite integral from A to B and that's going to give us the area area of the region now you also have this variant of the same formula so let's say the curve looks like this and we want to calculate the area bounded by the curve and instead of the xaxis it's going to be with the Y AIS so we want to find the area of this shaded region in this case we want this curve to be in terms of Y instead of X so here this is a function of X what we need to find is a function of Y now Y is equal to F ofx so Y is a function of X but in this case G it's a function of Y so G of Y is going to equal x make sure you see the difference here here we have y is equal to F ofx here we have X is equal to G of Y now to calculate the area for the second situation we need to find the definite integral from C to D so those are y values of G of Y Dy so make sure you understand that key Difference A and B are X values C and D are y values but for this particular problem we're going to use this form to calculate the area now the first thing we should do is we should draw a picture so we have y equal x^2 which looks like this and we want to find a region bounding by the curve from 0 to 3 so we only need the right side of that graph so this is zero let's say this point is three we're looking for the area of this region here so using the formula the area is going to be the definite integral from A to B of f ofx DX so a is Zer B is three those are the limits of integration and remember Y is equal to F ofx and in this problem Y is xÂ² so f ofx is x^2 Now using the power rule the anti-derivative of X2 is going to be we're going to add one to two so we'll get three and then we're going to divide by that result now we're going to evaluate it from A to B from 0 to 3 so first we're going to plug in three this is going to be 3 3 over 3 and then we're going to plug in zero so it's 0 to the 3 over 3 3 3r is 27 ID 3 is 9 so the area of the region Bound By The Curve is equal to 9 square units now let's try this problem find the area of the region bounded by the curve y = 4 - x^2 from X = 0 to x = 2 so let's begin by drawing a picture now we know that positive x^2 looks like this negative x^2 is a parabola that opens downward now that Parabola is shifted four units up so instead of starting from the origin it's going to start four units above that so our graph is going to look like this now it's always good to find the X intercepts to find the x intercept set y equal to Z and solve for x so what we have is the difference of perfect squares so we could use the formula a^ 2us B2 to factor it into a + b time a minus B so the square < TK of 4 is 2 and the square < TK of x^2 is X so this is going to be 2 + x and 2 - x if you set the first Factor equal to zero you're going to get X is equal to -2 and if you set the second Factor equal to zero and if you solve for x you'll get X is equal to pos2 so this intercept is at -2 this one is at positive2 now we want to find the area of the region bounded by the curve from 0 to pos2 so only just the right side of this graph so using the formula the area is the definite integral from A to B F ofx DX we have that the area is going to be the integral from 0 to 2 and F ofx is y so that is 4 - x^2 and then DX now the anti-derivative of the constant 4 is simply just 4X for x^2 we know it's X Cub over 3 and we're going to evaluate it from 0 to 2 so first we're going to plug in two so this is 4 * 2 - 2 3r over 3 and then we'll plug in 0 so 4 * 0 - 03r over 3 4 * 2 is 8 2 to the 3r power 2 * 2 * 2 that's 8 as well and everything here is simply zero now in order to combine these two numbers we have a fraction and a whole number we need to get common denominators so I'm going to multiply eight by 3 over3 so this is going to be 24 over 3 - 8 over 3 24 - 8 is 16 so the area of the Shaded region is going to be 16 over3 square units now let's move on to number three find the area of the region bounded by the line yal X from xal -4 to xal 4 so let's start with a picture and here is the line yal X or at least a rough sketch of it somewhere over here it's going to be ne4 and somewhere over here we have pos4 so we want to find the area of these two shaded regions now it's important to understand that if you take the indefinite integral from -4 to 4 if you integrate it you're going to get a value of zero the area on the right this is going to be a positive value because it's above the x- axis the area on the left that you'll get will be a negative value because it's below the x- axis now typically when you're solving problems like this if it tells you to find the area you're typically want a positive value now there's two ways in which we could do this we could basically take this side and multiply it by two or we could break this up into two separate integrals this one will be positive but this one we can add a negative sign to it to make it positive but due to symmetry we can say that the area is simply going to be twice the value of the right side so if we integrate it from 0 to 4 and then simply double our answer we're going to get the area of the curve or I mean the area of the Shaded region so the anti-derivative of X is going to be x^2 / 2 and if we integrate it from 0 to 4 I mean evaluated from 0 to 4 the twos will cancel so we just have x^2 from 0 to 4 and if we plug in four this is going to be 4^ squar if we plug in zero and we're going to get 16 in total so that is the area of these two shaded regions it's 16 square units now we could confirm this answer using geometry so let's focus on the top right part what we have is a triangle the base of the triangle is 4 now the equation is y is equal to X so when X is 4 Y is 4 which means this triangle has a height of four now the area of a triangle is 1 12 base time height so 12 4 * 4 4 * 4 is 16 half of that is 8 so the area of this this triangle is8 and the area of the other triangle is also eight when you add the two together you get 16 so be careful with problems where you're dealing with negative areas or where the region is below the x-axis if you have a symmetrical situation like this you could just calculate the area of the right side and multiply it by two that will give you the entire answer in other cases if you don't have symmetry you need to do it this way so the area will be the integral from 0 to 4 x DX that will give us the area of the right side and then minus the integral from -4 to 0 x DX so this part will give us a negative area time -1 that'll make this positive 8 and will help us get the the right answer so that's how you can calculate the total area of the region bottom bind of the curve for Regions that are above the x-axis you can put a positive sign for Regions that are below the x-axis add a negative sign to it so that your overall answer will be positive number four find the area of the region bounded by the curve y = x^2 + 6 x - 8 and the X axis so what we have here is a quadratic equation and when you whenever you have it in standard form it's good to find the X intercepts so right now it's x^2 + 6 x - 8 so to find the X intercepts we need to replace y with z now I'm going to factor out Nega 1 so this becomes x^2 - 6 x + 8 so we have a trinomial where the leading coefficient is one so to factor it we need to find two numbers that multiply to 8 but add to the middle coefficient -6 so those two numbers will be -2 and -4 -2 +4 adds up to -6 but -2 * -4 multiplies to POS 8 so to factor this expression it's going to be x - 2 * x - four using the zero product property if we set each factor equal to zero we'll get the two intercepts x = 2 and x = 4 which I'm going to rewrite it here now notice that we have a parabola but with a negative in front of the X squ term so that means that the parola is going to open downward with this information we can draw a rough sketch accurate enough that will help us to get the right answer so we have an intercept at two and another one at four and the graph will look something like this let me use a different color so the region bounded by the curve and the x axis has to be none other than this region here so we need to integrate it from 2 to 4 from One X intercept to the other x intercept so the area is going to be the definite integral from 2 to 4 of the original expression x^2 + 6x - 8 so the anti-derivative of x^2 is going to be X Cub over 3 for X it will simply be x^2 over 2 and for a constant we just need to add an X to it so just to simplify this expression we have -1 over 3 x cub and 6 over 2 is 3 so this is + 3x^2 and then - 8X evaluated from 2 to 4 so let's begin by plugging in four and then minus now let's use the lower limit of integration let's plug in two and now at this point we just got to do the math so 4 Cub is 64 4 2 is 16 * 3 that's 48 8 * 4 is 32 2 to the 3 is 8 so this becomes 8 over 3 2^ 2 is 4 * 3 is 12 8 * 2 is 16 so right now we have -64 over 3 48 - 32 that's pos6 here we need to distribute the negative sign so this is going to be positive 8 over3 12 - 16 is -4 times the ne 1 out in front here that's going to be pos4 now we can combine these two since they're like terms -64 + 8 is -56 and then 16 + 4 is 20 I'm going to write that as 20 over 1 and then to get common denominators I'm going to multiply the top and bottom by three so a = -56 over 3 and then 20 * 3 is 60 56 + 60 is 4 so the total area of the Shaded region is 4 over3 square units now let's work on one more problem find the area of the region bounded by the curve y = 3x - x^2 from x = -2 to x = 3 well let's begin by drawing a graph and let's find the X intercepts so let's replace y with z for this one I'm going to factor out an x 3X / X is 3x^2 / X ISX now if we set each factor equal to zero we get x = 0 and here we get 3 - x is 0 add in X to both sides we get X 3 so we have an intercept at x = 0 and at x = 3 which means and we have a negative in front of the X squ so we know the parabola it opens downward kind of like this now I'm going to have to extend this side a little bit longer the reason for that is we want to integrate it or find the area from -2 to pos3 so we're going to need this part of the graph as well as this part so here we have a positive area and here we have a negative area but we can't use Symmetry and just take one side and multiply by two we have to break this into two separate integrals so let's call this area 1 and we'll call this area 2 the total area is going to be the absolute value of area 2 plus Area 1 now area 2 is positive so once we remove the absolute value symbol it's just A2 A1 is a negative value so in order to keep it positive we need to add a negative sign to it so the total positive area is going to be A2 minus A1 in this example now this area is simply the definite integral from 0 to 3 of the function 3x - x^2 now for the other one we have negative we need to integrate it from -2 to 0o but we're dealing with the same function 3x - x^2 so now that we have this expression all we got to do is just do the work so the anti-der dtive of 3x is going to be 3x^2 / 2 and for x^2 it's just X Cub over 3 and here it's going to be evaluated from 0 to three and then for the second part we'll have the same expression but we need to keep in mind that there's a negative sign in front of it but this time we're going to evaluate it from -2 to 0 so substituting three into this expression we have 3 * 3^2 / 2 minus 3 3r over 3 and then when we plug in zero this entire thing will be zero so this is just area two now for this part once we plug in zero everything is zero and then minus we need to plug in -2 so it's going to be 3 * -2 2 / 2us -2 3r over 3 3^ 2 is 9 * 3 that's 27 so this is 27 over 2 here 3 3r is 27 / 3 so this is going to be 9 and then minus and then we have another negative sign here the zero we could just not worry about -2 2 is 4 / 2 is 2 * 3 that's going to be 6 here we have -2 3r that's -8 * A-1 that's POS 8 so Plus 8 over3 all right these two negative signs will cancel so that's just going to be positive so we can just write it out like this plus 6 + 8 over3 -9 + 6 that's going to be -3 now what we need to do at this point is we need to get common denominators so let's try to get a common denominator of 6 so -3 over 1 I'm going to multiply by 6 over 6 27 over2 I'm going to multiply by 3 over 3 and 8 over3 I'm going to multiply by 2 over 2 so this is -8 over 6 27 * 3 20 * 3 is 60 7 * 3 is 21 when you add 60 and 21 you get 81 and 8 * 2 is 16 -8 + 16 that's going to be -2 so we have 81 over 6 - 2 over 6 and 81 - 2 is 79 so we have 79 over 6 and if we want to we can break this up so that we can get a mixed fraction 79 is 60 + 18 + 1 60 / 6 is 10 18 ID 6 is 3 and we have this so 10 + 3 is 13 so we have 13 + 1 6 whereas a mixed fraction 13 and 16 so the total area we can leave it as an improper fraction 79 over 6 or we could leave it as a mixed number 13 and 16 so that's basically it for this video now you know how to calculate the area under the curve I do have other videos in calculus that is related to this topic such as how to calculate the area between curves now you could do a YouTube search to find that video or you could check out the links in the description section below I also have other videos like uh the disc method you know how to calculate the volume using the disc method the shell method and by using cross-sections so feel free to take a look at those videos when you get a chance and thanks for watching consider this problem find the area of the Shaded region bounded by the curves y = x^2 + 1 and y equal 4 as shown on the screen now this one there's different ways in which we can do this but let's use this formula the area is the integral from C to D of G of Y Dy now recall that Y is f ofx and X is G of Y so if you're using this formula what you need to do is you need to solve for y in this equation I mean not y but you need to solve for x in that equation so we have y is = x^2 + 1 solving for x we have y - 1 is equal to x^2 so X is going to be the square < TK of y - one and since X is G of y g of Y is the square < TK of Y -1 now the next thing we need to know are our C and D values this is D and this is C it's very clear for us to see that D is equal to four d c and d are y values C is 1 because when X is z y is equal to 1 using that formula so the area is the integral of 1: 4 of G of Y which is the square T of y - one which we can write it like this it's y - 1 ra to 12 Dy so let's go ahead and find the anti-derivative of that expression so we're going to add 1 to 12 which is 32 and then we're going to divide by 32 which is the same as multiplying it by 2 over 3 the derivative of y- one is just one so we don't need to worry about that if you were to use U substitution we would still get this answer now let's EV Val from 1 to 4 so this is 2 raised to the Yus who this is 2 * 4 - 1 raed to 3 over 2 over 3 and then minus 2 * 1 - 1 over 3 so 4 - 1 is 3 1 - 1 is just zero so right now we have 2 over 3 3 to the 3es that's 3 to the 3r raised to the 12 3 3r is 27 so this is 2 < TK 27 over 3 now the sare otk of 27 we could simplify that as thek of 9 * thek of 3 thek of 9 is 3 and so we could cancel that so we get that the area is 2 < tk3 so that is the area of the Shader region for this problem so that's how you can get the answer in terms of Y now the other method involves finding in the area between two curves and we can do it in terms of X so let's say we have two functions let's say the top function is f ofx the bottom function is G ofx and we want to find the area of the Shaded region between those two functions in this case the area is going to be the difference it's the definite integral from A to B and it's the difference of the top function f minus the bottom function G so if we're going to apply this formula to this problem instead of using C and D values we're going to be using A and B values since it's going to be in terms of X instead of Y so in this case this is going to be a and this is going to be B so a is xal 0 B is wherever this curve intersects the line yal 4 so we have to solve for that in order to find Bean we need to set these two equal to each other and we need to solve for x so 4 is going to equal x^2 + 1 subtracting both sides by 1 we get 3 is equal to x^2 so X is going to be the square < TK of 3 so B is positive < tk3 and this part here is root3 but we don't need that now in this example the top function is the line yal 4 so that's going to be F ofx the bottom function is the curve X2 + 1 so that's our G of X so using this formula we have this set up the area is going to be the integral from A to B A is0 B is the < TK of 3 and then f is 4 minus G which is xÂ² + 1 so we could simplify this expression 4 - 1 is 3 so this simplifies to 3 - x^2 if we distribute the negative sign anti-derivative of 3 is 3x for x^2 it's going to be X Cub over 3 evaluated from 0 to < tk3 so plugging in root3 we have 3 * < tk3 minus < tk3 to the 3 power over three and all of that minus zero so < tk3 to the 3 power so basically we have it three times if we multiply the square root of 3 * the < TK of 3 we're going to get the sare < TK of 9 and the squ < TK of 9 is three so we have this and 3 / 3 is 1 so we have 3 < tk3 - 1 < tk3 and 3 - 1 is 2 so we get the area is 2 < tk3 so those are two ways in which you can calculate the area of the Shader region you can do it in terms of X or you can do it in terms of Y depending on how you want to set up the problem just remember if you do it in terms of X you need to use a and b which are X values if you do it in terms of Y you need to use C and D which are y values
