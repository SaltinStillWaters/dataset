Transcript for: Hyperbolic Trig Functions - Basic Introduction
in this video we're going to talk about hyperbolic functions and let's compare it with trigonometric functions trigonometric functions are based on the unit circle the formula for that is x squared plus y squared is equal to one that is the equation of a circle where the radius has a value of one that's why it's called the unit circle since R is one now hyperbolic functions their base not on a unit circle but on the hyperbola one form of it looks like this that particular form has this equation x squared minus y squared is equal to one the only difference is we've exchanged a plus with a minus now in trigonometry you've seen this identity this is known as the Pythagorean identity it's cosine squared plus sine squared is equal to 1. now for hyperbolic functions there's a similar identity it's hyperbolic cosine squared of x minus hyperbolic sine squared of X is equal to one notice the similarities this equation corresponds to this equation here the equation of a circle this equation corresponds to the equation of a hyperbolic function now hyperbolic functions are basically combinations of exponential functions hyperbolic sine is equal to e to the x minus E to the negative x divided by 2. so as you can see it's just the combination of these two exponential functions now hyperbolic cosine it's very similar to hyperbolic sign the only difference is we're going to change the minus sign to a plus so it's e to the X Plus e to the negative x divided by 2. so you may want to write these down because we'll be using these formulas a lot in certain practice problems now hyperbolic tangent is equal to hyperbolic sine divided by hyperbolic cosine much in the same way as the regular tangent function is sine over cosine so if we were to take hyperbolic sign in its exponential form and divide it by hyperbolic cosine we would get this this is another form of hyperbolic tangent e to the x minus e to the negative X over e to the X Plus e to the negative X now we could simplify that equation even further if we multiply the top and the bottom by each of the X notice what happens first I'm going to rewrite it e to the negative X is 1 over e to the x so this is what we have and we're going to multiply the top and bottom by e to the x e to the x times e to the x when you multiply by Common bases you need to add the exponents for instance a squared times a to the Third is a to the two plus three which is a to the 5. so e 3x times e to the X you have X Plus X you get 2X when we multiply these two ECX times 1 over e to the X they cancel and we're just going to get minus one here this is going to give us e to the 2X and this is just going to give us Plus 1. so hyperbolic sine not only equals hyperbolics I mean hyperbolic tangent doesn't just equal hyperbolic sine over hyper cosine it equals e to the x minus E to the negative X over e to the X Plus e to the negative X and it also equals e to the 2x minus 1 over e to the 2x Plus 1. so those are the different forms in which you could represent hyperbolic tangent now let's talk about the reciprocal functions hyperbolic cosecant is simply one over hyperbolic sine very similar to how cosecant is one of a sine hyperbolic secant is 1 over cosine and hyperbolic cotangent is one over hyperbolic's tangent so those are the basic formulas that you want to know when it comes to hyperbolic trig functions now let's talk about some of the graphs of the hyperbolic trig functions so this is the graph of hyperbolic sign we can represent it as Y is equal to hyperbolic sine of x the domain for this graph is all row numbers and the range is all real numbers next we have hyperbolic cosine it looks like an upward parabola and it starts at a y value of 1. so the domain is going to be all row numbers X could be anything if you analyze it from left to right it goes from negative Infinity to the left positive Infinity to the right now the range of hyperbolic cosine is limited the lowest y value is one the highest y value is infinity so it goes from 1 to Infinity next we have hyperbolic tangent which is bounded by two horizontal asymptotes y equals one and Y equals negative one hyperbolic tangent touches the origin at zero and then it's going to follow each asymptote so that's a rough sketch of hyperbolic tangent and this is hyperbolic cosine now the domain for hyperbolic tangent if we look at the X values the graph goes all the way to the left from negative Infinity and it goes all the way to the right to positive Infinity so the domain for all three of these functions is all real numbers now the range it's bounded by the two horizontal asymptotes so the lowest you can be is negative one and the highest it could be is one but it doesn't include those values so we don't have a close interval we have an open interval so it's negative one to one so that's basically it for this video I wanted to give you just a basic introduction into hyperbolic trig functions I'm going to have other videos on this topic so feel free to take a look at that so if you go to the YouTube search bar type in hyperbolic trig functions organic chemistry tutor all the videos that I have on this topic should show up in the search results so feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance so if you go to my website video Dash tutor.net it's going to take you to this page where you can check out my ebook on how to pass math and science classes or if you want to get the first chapter free you can join my email list so feel free to take a look at this when you get a chance if you're interested but now let's get back to the video
