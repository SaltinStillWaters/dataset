Transcript for: Limit Formulas - Calculus 1
in this video we're going to talk about the formulas of limits that you may need to know for your upcoming tests the first one is this the limit as X approaches zero of sin x /x now this is equal to 1 the reciprocal is also true the limit as X approaches zero uh the expression X over sin x is also equal to 1 now this is something that you just have to know now the next one is similar to the previous two the limit as X approaches zero for tangent x/x is also equal to 1 and for the reciprocal it will be the same for X over tangent X this also equals 1 by the way for those of you who want a print out of these formulas uh feel free to check out the links below this video in the description section I'm going to post the formula sheet there for those of you who are interested in it now here's the next Formula the limit as X approach which is z of the expression 1 - cosine x / X this is equal to zero now the limit as X approaches Infinity of sin x /x this is going to be zero as well the limit as X approaches Infinity of the expression 1 /x that's zero s and cosine they could vary between -1 and 1 so it's like s * 1 x which will end up being zero so so as X approaches Infinity the expression cine x/x also goes to zero now let's talk about some exponential Limits The Limit as X approaches zero of e to the X this is going to be one you could use direct substitution to get this now for the next one you just have to know it the limit as X approaches Z of the expression e ra to x -1 /x that's going to be one now the limit as X approaches Infinity of the expression 1 + 1 /x raised to the X this is going to equal e likewise the limit as X approaches Z for the expression 1 + x raised to the 1/x this two is equal to e now this's a few more that we can go uh through here's the next one the limit as X approaches zero for the natural log of 1 + x X and this is overx this is equal to 1 and the limit as X approaches zero for a to X - 1 / X this is equal to the natural log of a and the limit as as X approaches Z for 1 + x raed to the N - 1/x is equal to n now some of these formulas you may use in your calculus course others um you might never use so it really depends on your teacher and what they decide to test you on but these are some limit formulas that you can add to your notes now I didn't cover all of them there's a few more however you could find the rest of those formulas in the formula sheet that I'm going to post in the description section below so feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance and thanks for watching this video
