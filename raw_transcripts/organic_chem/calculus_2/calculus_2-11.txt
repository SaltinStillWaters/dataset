Transcript for: Graphing Quadratic Functions Using a Data Table | Algebra
now let's talk about how to graph quadratic functions using a table so let's start with y is equal to x squared for this graph we know that the vertex is going to be at zero it's centered at the origin so what you need to do is pick two points to the right of the vertex and two points to the left the left side is going to have the same y values as the right side for instance if you plug in 1 1 squared and negative 1 squared they both equal the same thing positive 1. if you plug in 2 squared you're going to get 4. if you plug in negative 2 squared you're going to get negative 4. because they're equally distant about the vertex these two points will have the same y value and the other two points will also have the same y value and then you could plot it so the vertex is at the origin we have the point one one and negative one comma one and then we have the point two four and negative two four and then we can graph it now what is the domain of this function and what's the range the domain is all of the possible x values all the values that x can be and for quadratic functions there's no limitation on x x can be anything so it's going to be from negative infinity to infinity it's all real numbers if you analyze the graph from the left side x the graph starts all the way from the left and it keeps going towards the right as it travels to the right it keeps going up now the range has restrictions the range represents all of the y values the lowest y value is zero and the highest is infinity so therefore the range is from zero to infinity and since zero is included we're going to use brackets for parentheses i mean for infinity you should always use parentheses the vertex for this graph is the origin 0 0 and what is the axis of symmetry sometimes you might get questions on this the axis of symmetry is basically the x coordinate of the vertex it's x equals 0. if you draw the axis of symmetry notice that the right side is symmetric across that line now anytime a graph opens upward it has a minimum value the minimum value is basically the y coordinate of the vertex the lowest y value is zero now let's talk about graphing a quadratic function in vertex form using a table in vertex form here's the general equation y is equal to a x minus h squared plus k the vertex is h comma k so let's make a table the first thing we want to do is find the coordinates of the vertex so you got to change this sign if you see a one it make a negative one whatever sign is out here don't change it the vertex is negative one negative three now choose two points to the right of the vertex and two points to the left and then find the y values now keep in mind negative two and zero because they're equally distant from the vertex they will share the same y values the same is true for negative three and one that's why you want to set it up this way it requires less work to graph it so let's plug in zero when x is 0 what is the value of y 1 squared is 1 1 minus 3 is negative 2. so when x is 0 or negative 2 y is going to be negative 2. now what about when x is one one plus one is two two squared is four and four minus three is one so that's it now let's go ahead and graph it let's start with the vertex which is negative one negative three then we have the point zero negative two and negative two negative two next is one one and negative three one so that's the graph now go ahead and find the domain the range the axis of symmetry the maximum or the minimum value and that's about it so the domain for any quadratic functions is all real numbers negative infinity to infinity now for the range let's identify the lowest y value which is basically the y coordinate of the vertex it's negative three and the highest is infinity so the range is from negative three to infinity including negative three the axis of symmetry is simply the x coordinate of the vertex so the aos is x is equal to negative one that's how you write it and because the graph opens upward there's going to be a minimum value which is the y coordinate of the vertex the minimum value is negative three the location of the minimum value is x equals negative one the x value represents the location the y value represents the minimum value or sometimes the maximum value if the graph opens downward now let's work on one more example let's say that y is equal to negative x squared plus four x plus one so this time we have a quadratic function in standard form let's graph it using a data table so the first thing we need to do is find the vertex the x coordinate of the vertex is negative b over 2a it's very useful to use this equation if you have the quadratic function in standard form b is the number in front of x which is 4. a is a number in front of x squared if you don't see one it's a 1 but since we have a negative sign it's negative one so negative four divided by negative two is positive two so that's the x coordinate of the vertex now choose two x values to the right of two and two to the left now let's plug in the vertex into this equation first so negative two squared plus four times two plus one that's negative four plus eight plus one which is four plus one that's five so that's the y coordinate of the vertex now let's plug in one one and three will have the same y value but it's easier to deal with one rather than three negative one squared is negative one four times one is four negative one and one cancels so it's gonna be four and that's gonna be the same thing now if we plug in zero zero squared is zero four times zero is zero plus one the whole thing is one so that's what we're gonna have now we can go ahead and graph at this point so the vertex is at two comma five the next point is that one four and we have one at three four and then zero one and four one and so we're going to get a nice symmetric graph as long as we pick two points to the right of the vertex and two points to the left now the domain is going to be everything negative infinity to infinity go ahead and find the range the axis of symmetry and then the maximum or minimum values the range let's see the lowest y value for the range is negative infinity and the highest is 5 which is the y coordinate of the vertex so the range is from negative infinity to positive five and it includes five so we're gonna put a bracket there the axis of symmetry is the x coordinate of the vertex which is two so it's x equals two and here it is now because the graph opens downward it's not going to have a minimum value rather it's going to have a maximum value the maximum value is the y coordinate of the vertex so it's five and so that's it for this lesson you
