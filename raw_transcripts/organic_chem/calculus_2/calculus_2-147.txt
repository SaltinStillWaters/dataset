Transcript for: Basic Integration Problems
in this video we're going to go over some basic integration rules so let's say if you want to integrate dx for example this will give you x plus some constant c if you wish to integrate d y this will give you y plus c or if you want to integrate dt that will give you t plus c and so this is the variable of integration and make sure you always add that particular variable based on what you see here now what if we have a constant so let's say if we wish to integrate a constant with a variable of x this is going to equal kx plus c so if i want to integrate 5 dx this is going to be 5x plus c if i wish to integrate let's say 12 d y that's going to be 12y plus c or 4 dt this is going to be 4t plus c now another rule that you need to be familiar with is the power rule the anti-derivative of x raised to the n dx is equal to x raised to the n plus one divided by n plus one plus some constant c so let me give you some examples of using this power rule so let's say if we wish to find the anti-derivative of x squared dx this is going to be x raised to the 2 plus 1 divided by 2 plus 1 plus c so it's x cubed over 3 plus c which you could write that as 1 3 x cubed plus c so let's try some more examples using the power rule go ahead and find the anti-derivative of x cubed 10 x to the fourth and also let's say one over x squared go ahead and try these problems so for this one 3 plus 1 is 4 so it's going to be x to the fourth over 4 plus c for the next one 4 plus 1 is 5 so it's x to the fifth over 5. but we could simplify it 10 divided by 5 is 2 so it's 2x to the fifth power plus c now what about the last one 1 over x squared what can we do for that example before you integrate it you need to rewrite it so we can rewrite it as x raised to the negative 2 dx and then use the power rule so it's x raised to negative two plus one divided by negative two plus one plus c and so negative two plus one is negative one and then we can rewrite the final answer as negative one over x plus c so anytime you have a rational function like this one make sure to rewrite it so let's try another simple example let's say if we want to integrate 7 over x to the fourth power try that one so first let's rewrite it as seven x raised to the negative four and then let's use the power rule so it's going to be negative 4 plus 1 divided by negative 4 plus 1 plus c and negative 4 plus 1 is negative 3. so then this is equal to negative seven divided by three x to the third power plus c and that's the final answer now you can also use the power rule when integrating radical functions let's say if we want to find the antiderivative of the cube root of x so first you need to rewrite it this is x to the one third and then use the power rule so this is going to be x raised to the one-third plus one divided by one-third plus one plus c so one-third plus one we need to get common denominators and one is the same as three over three and one plus three is four so we can write this as x raised to the four thirds divided by four over three plus c now we can multiply the top and the bottom by the reciprocal of four over three and that is three fourths so on the bottom the threes will cancel and the fours will cancel so we can rewrite the final answer as three fourths x raised to the four over three plus c now let's go over the anti-derivatives of six trigonometric functions the antiderivative of cosine x is sine x you should write these down and commit them to memory the antiderivative of sine x is negative cosine x now keep in mind if you know the derivative then you can know the anti-derivative the derivative of sine is cosine the derivative of cosine is negative sine so the derivative of negative cosine is positive sine now the anti-derivative of secant squared that's equal to tangent x and the anti-derivative of secant x tangent x dx that's going to be secant x plus c and the antiderivative of cosecant squared is going to be negative cotangent x plus c and the antiderivative of cosecant x cotangent x that's negative cosecant x plus c so hopefully you had a chance to write that down and let's work on some example problems go ahead and integrate this function eight cosine x plus three sine x dx so the antiderivative of cosine we said is sine so this is going to be 8 times sine and the antiderivative of sine is negative cosine and let's not forget to add plus c so the final answer is 8 sine x minus 3 cosine x plus c and so if you know the formulas it's very easy to integrate trigonometric functions that look like this here's another one that you could try find the antiderivative of four secant squared x minus secant x tangent x so the anti-derivative of secant squared we know it's tangent x and the anti-derivative of secant tan is secant x so this is the answer it's 4 tangent x minus secant x plus the constant of integration c let's work on one more example with regards to trig functions let's integrate cosecant x times cotangent x minus cosecant x now for this particular example we need to rewrite it before we integrate it let's distribute cosecant to cotangent minus cosecant so cosecant times cotangent that's just cosecant cotangent we still have the integration symbol and then cosecant times cosecant is cosecant squared now the antiderivative of cosecant cotangent is negative cosecant x and the antiderivative of cosecant squared is negative cotangent x so the final answer is going to be i'm going to reverse these two so i have positive cotangent x and negative cosecant x this part is positive because we have two negative signs now let's talk about integrating exponential functions like e to the u it's going to be e to the u divided by u prime plus c if u is a linear function or if u prime is a constant if u prime is not a constant this will not work so let's work on some examples let's say if we want to integrate e to the 4x it's going to be the same thing e to the 4x divided by the derivative of 4x which is 4. because this is a constant this will be the right answer now let's say if we want to integrate e to the seven x minus three let's not forget dx so it's going to be the same thing e to the seven x minus three and the derivative of seven x minus three is a constant like 7 and so that's going to be the answer now let's say if we want to integrate e to the x it's going to be the same thing divided by the derivative of x which is 1 so it's simply e plus some constant c now this one won't work we can't say it's e to the x squared divided by 2x this is not a constant so in this situation this will not be the answer if you try to find the derivative of this expression it will not give you e to the x squared now let's move on to logarithmic functions the antiderivative of one over u d u is going to be the natural log of u divided by u prime and the same is true u has to be a linear function and u prime must be a constant if it's a variable it won't work so let's say if we want to find the anti-derivative of one over x it's going to be ln x divided by the derivative of x which is one plus c so let's say if we want to integrate one over x plus five it's going to be the natural log of x plus 5 and the derivative of x plus 5 is 1 and so it's just ln x plus 5 plus c now try this one what's the antiderivative of one over four x minus three so it's going to be the natural log of four x minus three and the derivative of four x minus three is four now let's confirm the answer let's find the derivative of this expression so if we were to differentiate 1 4 natural log 4x minus 3 will we get the original answer the original problem i mean to differentiate the natural log of u it's equal to u prime over u so in this case u is 4x minus 3 and u prime is four so this is gonna be one fourth and then u prime over u so four over four x minus three and the derivative of a constant is going to be zero so in this case the fours will cancel and so this will give us the original problem one over four x minus three and so it works let's try one more example what is the antiderivative of seven over three x minus eight times dx so what i'm going to do is move the constant seven to the front and then apply the same process in the last problem so u is going to be 3x minus 8. so then this is going to be 7 times ln of u or ln of 3x minus 8 divided by the derivative of 3x minus 8 which is 3 plus c so the final answer is going to be 7 over 3 natural log 3x minus 8 plus c so that's it and let's confirm it with differentiation so let's find the derivative of this expression so it's going to be seven thirds times the derivative of ln three x minus eight and the derivative of c is zero so in this case once again we need to apply this formula the derivative of ln u is u prime over u so we can see u is the stuff inside of the natural log function so that's three x minus eight which means u prime is three so it's going to be 7 over 3 times u prime over u 3 over 3x minus 8 plus 0. and we can see that the 3s will cancel giving us the original problem of 7 over x minus eight so that's how you can confirm it you
