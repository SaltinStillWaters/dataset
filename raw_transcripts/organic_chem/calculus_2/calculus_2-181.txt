Transcript for: Integration By Parts - Tabular Method
in this video we're going to talk about how to perform integration by parts using a very quick method known as the tabular method so let's start with this problem what is the integral of x squared e to the x dx how can we use the tabular method to get the answer well first let's make a table in the first column we're going to put the signs and in the second column the derivative and in the third column integrals now when dealing with integration by parts you have this formula the integral of u dv is equal to u times v minus the integral of v d u notice that the first term has a positive sign and the second term has a negative sign so therefore the signs will alternate the first one is going to be positive the second one negative the third is going to be positive and for the fourth term it's going to be negative now to use integration by parts we need to make u equal to x squared and dv is going to be equal to e to the x dx but let's not worry about the dx term for now so for the derivative section u is going to be equal to x squared and then we're going to find the derivatives of u so u prime the derivative of x squared is 2x and then u double prime that's going to be 2 u triple prime the derivative of a constant is 0. now dv we said it's going to be e to the x and the integral of dv is v and the integral of e to the x is e to the x let's call this v1 the first integral v2 the second integral it's going to be the same the integral of each dx will change and the third integral is going to stay the same so now to get the answer for the first term you're going to start with the first sign and the first entry in the derivative column multiplied by the second entry in the integral column so it's going to be plus x squared times e to the x that's the first term of the answer now the second term it has a negative sign 2x and then it's going to be multiplied by e to the x so it's going to be negative 2x e to the x and for the third term it's going to have a positive side a 2 and e to the x as well so it's just plus 2 e to the x now the next term u triple prime is 0 and 0 times anything is 0 so we don't have to worry about that so we could just add plus c at this point so this is the answer and now you know how to do integration by parts the faster using the tablet method so let's work on some more examples let's try this problem find the definite integral or rather the indefinite integral of x cubed sine x dx feel free to pause the video if you want to try so let's begin with the table so we're going to have signs that's going to be in the first column then the derivative for the u term and then the integral for dv so the first term is going to have a positive sign the next one is going to be negative and then positive and negative and so forth so we can differentiate x cubed to zero so we want to make u equal to x cubed we can write that on the side u is going to be equal to x cubed dv that's going to be equal to sine x dx so u prime is going to be the derivative of x cubed which is 3x squared and then u double prime that's going to be the derivative of 3x squared so that's 6x and the derivative of 6x is six and if we differentiate it one more time it's going to be zero so let's put a positive sign here which we really don't need the fifth row i'm just gonna write it now let's focus on dv so dv is sine x and the integral of sine x that's going to be the derivative of cosine is negative sine so the derivative of negative cosine is positive sign so the integral of sine is negative cosine and the integral of cosine is sine so the integral of negative cosine is negative sine and the integral of negative sign is cosine and the integral of positive cosine is positive sine so just to check you could say the derivative of sine is cosine the derivative of cosine is negative sine the derivative of negative sign is negative cosine and the derivative of cosine is negative sine so the derivative of negative cosine is sine so you can go backwards and check to make sure if you did it correctly now the first answer is going to have the first sign the first term in the second column and the second entry in the third column so this is going to be negative x cubed cosine x because we have a positive sign here and a negative sign there now for the second term it's going to have a negative sign 3x squared and then we're going to multiply it by negative sine x so there's two negative signs we have to deal with so it's going to be positive 3x squared sine x now for the next one it's going to have a positive sign we're going to multiply it by 6x and cosine x so it's going to be positive 6x cosine x and for the next term let's use a different color it's going to have a negative sign we're going to multiply by 6 and sine x so it's going to be negative 6 sine x and once you get to 0 you can stop there and then plus c so this is the final answer that's the integral of x cubed sine x dx now let's work on another problem find the antiderivative of x to the fifth times ln x now for this problem i wouldn't recommend using the integration by parts tabular method because you can do this simply using the integration by parts formula once and it's best to use the original method instead of the tabular method now we're going to make u equal to ln x as opposed to x to the fifth because you need to do integration by parts to even find the integral of l and x so it's easier to find the derivative of ln x which is one of x so that means that dv has to be x to the fifth times dx since u is ln x now v that's going to be the integral of dv so the antiderivative of x to the fifth is going to be x to the sixth divided by six or one over six times x to the sixth so using the formula the integral of u dv is u times v minus the integral of v d u so u times v that's ln x times one sixth x to the sixth so that's going to be one over six x to the sixth l and x and then minus the integral of v which is one over six x to the sixth times d u and that's one over x dx notice that we can integrate the result of this expression so let's go ahead and do that but first let's rewrite the expression so let's take the constant one over six and move it to the front so it's going to be minus one over six and then the integral symbol x to the sixth divided by x that's gonna be x to the fifth power now the antiderivative of x to the fifth using the power rule is going to be x to the sixth divided by six plus some constant c so the final answer is one over six x to the six l and x and then we have six times six which is thirty six so it's going to be minus 1 over 36 x to the 6 plus c and so for this problem i would recommend using the tablet method because there's no need you only need to use the integration by parts formula just once now let's go back to that problem the integral of x to the fifth l and x dx and let's talk about why we can't use the tableau method so we're gonna have s for sines d for derivatives i for integrals now we need to make u equal to l and x because if we made dv ln x as we mentioned before we have to integrate ln x using integration by parts to find v so it's easy to make u l and x and so dv is going to be x to the fifth dx because it's easy to integrate x to the fifth so let's put our signs so u is l and x dv is x to the fifth the derivative of ln x is one over x and the derivative of one over x is negative one over x squared and if we differentiate negative one over x squared it's going to be we need to rewrite it and then use the power rule so it's positive two x to the negative three and so that's two over x to the third so notice that we're not going to get a zero in this column and for this column the antiderivative of x to the fifth is x to the sixth divided by six or 1 6 times x to the sixth and the antiderivative of this is going to be x to the 7 and 6 times 7 is 42 so that's going to be 1 over 42 and notice that the exponents are increasing so there's no way we can get a zero and whenever you see a situation like this it's best not to use the tabular method so i just want to make sure that you're aware of that so what about this problem the integral of e to the x sine x dx can we use the tabular method for this problem what do you think well let's try it so let's have signs derivatives and integrals let's make u equal to sine x because it's easy to find the derivative of sine and let's make dv e to the x to dx so first we have a positive sign and for the u terms we're going to put sine x here and for the for dv we have uh e to the x the derivative of sine is cosine and the integral of e to the x is e to the x and so this column is not going to change the derivative of cosine is negative sine and the derivative of negative sign is negative cosine so the derivatives and the integrals of sine and e to the x they're repetitive as you can see and so we're not going to get a zero anywhere in any of these two columns so let's not use the tablet method for this problem we need to use just integration by parts old style so we're going to keep u as sine x and dv as each dx dx so du is going to be cosine x dx and v is just e3x so let's write the formula first the integral of u dv is u times v minus the integral of v d u so u times v that's going to be e to the x times sine x and then minus the integral of v which is e to the x times d u cosine x dx so now we need to use the integration by parts formula for this integral so i'm going to make u equal to cosine and v is dv is going to be east dx dx so let's write that so u is going to be cosine x dv e to the x dx so v is e to the x and d u is going to be negative sine x dx so this is going to be the integral of e to the sine x i mean e to the x sine x dx and that's equal to e to the x sine x and then minus and then it's going to be u times v so e to the x cosine x minus the integral of v d u v is e to the x d u is negative sine x dx so let's simplify what we have let's begin by distributing the negative sign that we see here so this is going to be negative e to the x cosine x and then we have three negative signs to deal with so a negative times a negative times a negative it's simply a negative so this is going to be negative integral e to the x sine x now notice that we have common terms here so what we're going to do is we're going to add the integral of e sine x dx to both sides so on the right side these will cancel on the left side we have 2 times the integral of e to the x sine x dx and that's equal to e to the x sine x minus e to the x cosine x now all we need to do is multiply both sides by a half and so this will give us the final answer on the left side two times a half is one so the integral of e x sine x dx is going to be one half e to the x sine x minus e to the x cosine x and don't forget to add plus c and so this is the answer so sometimes it's best to use the integration by parts formula other times it's better to use the tablet method and i would use the tablet method for problems that look like this let's say if you have x to the 4 sine x this can go to 0 but this part repeats or if you have let's say the integral of x to the 7 e to the 4x x to the 7 you could differentiate it to 0 but e to the 4x is a repetitive function when you find the derivative for the integral so for problems like these two you can use the tablet method you
