Transcript for: Second Derivative Test
in this video we're going to use the second derivative test to determine if there's any relative extrema in a function if there's a relative maximum or a relative minimum so let's talk about a relative maximum or a local maximum in order to get a local max the critical number has to be found so the first derivative has to equal zero at some point c so c is the point where the local max will be located along the x axis so f prime of c has to be equal to 0 and the second derivative at c has to be negative or less than zero whenever the second derivative is negative at a critical number it's going to be concave down so you can have this shape and you could see clearly from the graph that there is a maximum at this point and that's going to be the c value that we need that's when we have the horizontal tangent which is typical of a local maximum or relative maximum now to use the second derivative test to identify the local minimum which will occur at a critical number f prime of c must be zero so that's how we could find the critical number and the second derivative at that critical number has to be greater than zero or it has to be positive which means that it has to be concave up so we're going to have that shape and so we could see that we have a minimum at the bottom now let's work on an example problem so let's say that f of x is 2x cubed minus 12x squared so go ahead and use the second derivative test to determine any relative extrema in this particular function so feel free to try it now let's determine the first derivative so we can identify any critical numbers the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared times two well let's do it one step at a time the derivative of x squared is two x and so two times three is six twelve times two is twenty four now to find the critical numbers we need to set the first derivative equal to zero next let's factor out the gcf which in this example is going to be 6x so 6x squared divided by 6x is x negative 24x divided by 6x is negative four and then set each factor equal to zero so if we set six x equal to zero and then divide by six we can see that the first critical number is at x equals zero and if we set x minus four equal to zero and then add four to both sides the second critical number is at x equal four so i'm going to write that at the top over here so i can erase the stuff on the bottom so we have two critical numbers now let's find the second derivative to determine the concavity so we said the first derivative was 6x squared minus 24x now for the second derivative it's going to be 6 times the derivative of x squared which is 2x and 24 times the derivative of x which is 1. and so that's going to be 12x minus 24. so now let's set the second derivative equal to zero and let's take out the gcf which is 12. so we have a potential inflection point at x equals two so let's create a sign chart now if we plug in a test point greater than two let's say three into the second derivative three minus two is positive if we plug in a number less than two let's say one one minus two is negative so it's concave down between negative infinity and 2 and concave up between 2 and infinity so therefore the second derivative at 0 we could say is less than zero it's negative because zero is between negative infinity and two now granted you could just take this number and plug it into this expression actually not that one but you could plug it into 12x minus 24. you really don't need to create a sign chart so just keep that in mind so for the second example instead of using the sign chart i can evaluate f double prime of 4. so that's going to be 12 times 4 minus 24. 12 times 4 is 48 48 minus 24 is 24 so that's positive and as you can see 4 is between 2 and infinity so that's going to be positive as well so f double prime of 4 is going to be greater than 0. when the second derivative is less than zero it's going to have a negative sign and when it's greater than zero that means it's positive when the second derivative is positive we have a graph that is concave up and when the second derivative is negative it's concave down so you can see that a concave up graph is associated with a minimum and a concave down graph is associated with a maximum so at x equals zero we have a maximum and at x equals four we have a minimum and that's how you can use the second derivative test to determine the relative extrema in the function you need to find the critical numbers and then find out what the second derivative is at those critical numbers but now let's confirm our answer using the first derivative test so let's put the critical numbers on this number line now we need to rewrite the first derivative in its factored form so it was 6x squared minus 24x and if we take out 6x it's going to be 6x times x minus 4. so let's say if we plug in a test point that is greater than 4 like 5. 6 times five is positive five minus four is positive if you multiply two positive numbers that will give you a positive result now let's plug in a number between zero and four let's try two 6 times 2 is positive 2 minus 4 is negative a positive and a negative equals a negative now if we plug a negative 1 6 times negative 1 is negative negative 1 minus 4 is negative a negative times a negative is a positive number so going from positive to negative the function is increasing and then it's decreasing so this indicates that we have a maximum at zero which indeed we do and going from negative to positive it's decreasing and then increasing so that's a minimum at 4 which we do have and so that's how you can use the first derivative test to confirm the results of the second derivative test now it's your turn let's say if we have the function f of x is equal to four x cubed minus six x squared minus 24x plus 1. use the second derivative test to determine the relative extrema of the function so first let's find the first derivative to identify all the critical numbers so it's going to be 12 x squared and the derivative of 6x squared that's 12x and for 24x it's just going to become 24. now let's set it equal to 0 and let's take out a 12. so it's gonna be x squared minus x minus two and so we need to factor this expression two numbers that multiply to negative two but add to negative one that's going to be negative two and positive one so to factor it's gonna be x minus two times x plus one so the critical numbers are positive two and negative one if you set each factor equal to zero so now that we have those critical numbers let's determine the sign of the second derivative at those points so first we need to find the second derivative the derivative of 12x squared is 24x and the derivative of 12x is just 12. but we have a negative sign in front so the second derivative at 2 that's going to be 24 times 2 minus 12. 24 times 2 is 48 minus 12 that's positive 36. now let's do the same for the other critical number negative one so it's 24 times negative one which is negative 24 minus 12 that's a negative 36. so at two it's positive therefore it's concave up and at negative one it's negative so if the second derivative is negative then it's concave down and anytime it's concave up it's associated with a minimum when it's concave down it's associated with a maximum this is a max and this is a minimum so we can write the answers over here so at 2 we have a minimum and at negative 1 we have a maximum so let's confirm the results with the first derivative test so let's make a sign chart so first let me get rid of this so the critical numbers are negative one and two so using the first derivative in its factored form let's plug in some test points so i'm going to try three three minus two is positive three plus one is positive next i'm going to try zero zero minus two is negative zero plus 1 is positive so that will give us the negative result and then negative 3 minus 2 is negative negative 3 plus 1 is negative so we're going to get a positive result so for negative 1 it's increasing and then it's decreasing so this is a maximum which we do have at negative one and at two it's decreasing then increasing so we have a minimum at two and don't let this negative 2 confuse you at 2 we do indeed have a minimum so this answer is confirmed and so that's it now you know how to use the second derivative tests to determine the relative extrema of the function and you can confirm it with the first derivative test so make sure you find the critical numbers and then see if the second derivative is positive or negative at those critical numbers if the second derivative is positive that means that it's concave up and so you have a minimum if the second derivative is negative that means it's concave down and you're going to have a maximum at that critical number and so that's it for this video hopefully you found it to be helpful thanks for watching you
