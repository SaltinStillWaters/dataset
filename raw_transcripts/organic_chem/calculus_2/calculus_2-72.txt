Transcript for: How To Find The Equation of the Normal Line
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the equation of a normal line so let me just give you some background information on this let's say we have the curve y is equal to x squared and we want to find the normal line at some point let's say at this point the tangent line is the line that intersects this curve at one point i'm going to put t for tangent the normal line which i'm going to draw on blue it is the line that is perpendicular to the tangent line so let's say that the slope of the tangent line is positive 4 over the slope of the normal line is going to be the reciprocal the negative reciprocal of this value negative five over four but the point of intersection is the same so that's what you need to know about this type of problem once you calculate the slope of the tangent line at let's say in this case x equals 2 you need to find the negative reciprocal of that that's going to give you the slope of the normal line and then using the point you can write the equation of the normal line with this formula all you need is the x y coordinate where the normal line touches the curve and you need the slope of the normal line so let me show you how to do that with this particular problem so first we need the point we have the x coordinate of the point but not the y coordinate to find the y coordinate we can plug in our x value into that formula so let's replace x with two so this is going to be two to the third minus four times two squared plus five two to the third power that's two times two times two that's eight two squared is four and then four times four is sixteen eight minus sixteen is negative eight negative eight plus five is negative three so the y coordinate is negative three thus we have the point two negative three now the next thing we need to do is calculate the slope of the tangent line which will help us get the slope with the normal line we can get the slope of the tangent line by taking the first derivative of the function keep in mind the derivative of a variable raised to a constant such as x raised to the n is going to be n times x raised to the n minus 1. so the derivative of x cubed is going to be 3 x 3 minus 1 or 2. the derivative of x squared is going to be 2x to the first power and the derivative of a constant like 5 is 0. so the first derivative of this function is going to be three x squared minus eight x now to get the slope of the tangent line we're gonna plug in x equals two so this is gonna be three times two squared minus eight times two so two squared is four four times three is twelve and eight times two is sixteen twelve minus sixteen is negative four so negative four is the slope of the tangent line to calculate the slope of the normal line we're going to change the sign from negative to positive and we're going to reciprocate four or flip it over one which will make it one over four i mean flip it under one rather so that is the slope of the normal line it's positive one over four so in order to write the equation of any line all we need is the slope of the line and a point on the line and we could define any line so let's use the point slope formula y minus y one is equal to m times x minus x1 so y1 is this is going to be y1 and that's x1 y1 is negative 3 m is 1 over 4 and x1 is 2. so two negative signs will change into a positive sign so this is going to be y plus three and then we're going to distribute the fraction to x minus two so this is gonna be one over four x one over four times negative two that's negative two over four which reduces to negative one half now the next thing we're gonna do is subtract both sides by three so we have y is equal to one fourth x negative one half minus three three can be written as six over two so this becomes negative seven over two this is the answer in slope intercept form by the way if you you can also leave your answer in point slope form especially if you're dealing with multiple choice tests so you could write your answer like this as well both answers are correct they're simply different ways of representing them and so that's basically it that's how you could find the equation of a normal line if you're given a curve and either the x value or the entire point at which you need to find the normal line now for the sake of practice let's go ahead and work on another example number two find the equation of the normal line to the curve y equal 3x squared minus 5x minus 7 at x equal 3. so let's begin by calculating the y value when x is three so we're gonna have three times three squared minus five times three minus seven three squared is nine five times three is fifteen and three times nine is twenty seven i'm going to reverse the order of these two to make the operation easier 27 minus seven is 20 and twenty minus fifteen is five so we got the point three comma five so that's where we want to find the equation of the normal line that's where it touches the curve so now the next thing we need to do is calculate the first derivative and use that to determine the slope of the tangent line the derivative of x squared is two x the derivative of x is one for those of you who want to know why here's what you can do so moving the one to the front and then we're gonna have x one minus one is zero anything raised to the zero power is one so you just get one and the derivative of a constant is zero using the power rule here's one way to show it so negative seven is equivalent to negative seven times x raised to zero moving to zero to the front we have negative seven times zero x to the minus one which will equal zero so right now we have that the first derivative is going to be six x minus five now let's replace x with three to get the slope of the tangent line so it's going to be six times three minus five six times three is eighteen eighteen minus five is thirteen now the slope of the normal line is going to be negative 1 of or divided by the slope of the tangent line so it's negative 1 divided by 13. so now we have everything that we need we got the slope of the normal line and we have the point at which it meets up with the curve so now let's use the point slope formula y minus y1 is equal to m times x minus x one y one is five m is negative one over thirteen and x one is three so if we want the answer in point-slope form we could leave it like this but let's get it in slope-intercept form so let's distribute negative 1 over 13 to x and to negative 3. so negative 1 times negative 3 that's going to be positive 3 but over 13. now the next thing that we need to do is add 5 to both sides so we're going to have y is equal to negative 1 over 13x now three over thirteen plus five i'm gonna write five as five over one and then i'm going to multiply the top and bottom by thirteen five times thirteen five times ten is fifty five times three is fifteen add in fifty plus fifteen gives us sixty five now that we have the same denominator we can add the numerators of the two fractions so 3 plus 65 is 68 so this is plus 68 over 13. so that's how we can write the equation of the normal line for this particular problem in slope intercept form so that's it for this video the next video that i'm going to create related to this topic is finding the slope of a secant line so if you want to do a youtube search on that just type in how to find the slope of a secant line organic chemistry tutor and it should come up but that's it for this video thanks for watching
