here is a question for you how can you estimate the value of 2.99 raised to the fourth power rounded to the nearest tenth place without the use of a calculator in this video we're going to talk about how to do that and we're going to confirm our answer with a calculator now this involves the use of calculus but it's not too complicated you can learn this the first thing we're going to do is replace 2.99 with a variable so we're going to choose x so we have x to the fourth power and that is going to be our function f of x now what we need to do in this problem is we need to write a linear equation that describes the behavior of this function near this value when x is 2.99 so first we're going to pick an integer value that is close to 2.99 and that's going to be 3. in order to write the linear equation that we want we need three things we need a point the x y coordinate of a point and we need the slope ideally the slope of the tangent line at the curve near this point so first we need to determine what our x value is going to be it's going to be an integer that is closest to this value and so the best thing to pick is 3. now we need to get y and the slope of the tangent line f of x is equal to y so y is going to be f of x when x is three and so that's going to be three to the fourth power three to the fourth power is equivalent to multiplying four threes three times three is 9 times 9 is 81. so now we have our y value which is 81. the next thing we need to do is calculate the slope of the tangent line and in order to do that we need to find the first derivative of the function known as f prime of x the derivative of a variable raised to a constant the derivative of x raised to the n power is going to be n times x raised to the n minus 1. so for example the derivative of x squared will be 2x to the first power the derivative of x cubed will be 3x to the second power the derivative of x to the fourth is 4x to the third power and the derivative of x to the fifth is 5x to the fourth power so this is what we need that's going to be f prime of x the derivative of x to the fourth power which we see here so now that we have f prime of x we can calculate the slope of the tangent line the derivative is a function that will tell us the slope of the tangent line at any x value now our x value is three so we need to calculate f prime of three and that's going to be four times three to the third power so this is four times three times three times three three times three is nine times three is twenty seven now four times twenty is eighty four times seven is twenty eight eighty plus 28 is 108 so that's 4 times 27 so the slope of the tangent line is equal to 108. so now we have everything that we need to write our linear equation that will approximate the curve f of x equals x to the fourth at x equals three and we're going to use the point slope formula y minus y one is equal to m times x minus x one so we have our m value x1 is 3 y1 is 81. so we're going to have y minus 81 is equal to 108 times x minus 3. now i'm going to move 81 from the left side to the right side it's negative on the left side but it's going to change to a positive value on the right side so y is equal to 108 times x minus 3 plus 81. so this equation describes the behavior of the curve x to the fourth when x is close to three so we could use that equation to estimate the y value when x is 2.99 so let's plug this in it's going to be 108 times 2.99 minus 3 plus 81. 2.99 minus 3 that's negative 0.01 now 0.1 times anything all we need to do to get the answer is move the decimal 2 units to the left so 108 times 0.01 is going to be 1.08 but it's going to be negative so what we have is negative 1.08 plus 81. let me clear away a few things so right now this is i'm going to reverse it it's 81 minus 1.08 now let's break down 1.08 into two numbers that's one and point zero eight eighty-one minus one is eighty now eighty minus point zero eight what do you think that's going to be well we can break this down into 79 plus 1 because 79 plus 1 is 80 and then minus 0.08 so what is one minus point zero eight well what is one hundred minus eight a hundred minus eight is ninety two so 1.00 minus 0.08 must be 0.92 so we have 79 plus 0.92 which is 79.92 whoops i'm not sure how that happened so we could say that 2.99 raised to the fourth power is we're going to round this to the nearest tenth so this is approximately 79.9 so let's see if our answer is accurate so we're going to use a calculator to get the exact answer or close to the exact answer so 2.99 raised to the fourth power here's what i got it's five 79.9253 eight eight zero one and my calculator stops there so 79.9 is very close to this number i mean it's the the rounded value 79.925 rounds to 79.9 so this method is acceptable so that's how you can estimate certain numbers like this if they're very close to some integer value i mean you could use it for anything but it's easier if they're close to a number like three four or five it just makes the math easier
