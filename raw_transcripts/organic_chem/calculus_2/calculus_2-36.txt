Transcript for: How To Evaluate Limits of Radical Functions | Calculus
consider the problem on the board what is the limit as x approaches 3 given the function that we have the square root of 12 minus x minus 3 over the square root of 7 minus x minus 2. how can we evaluate that limit feel free to pause the video if you want to try this problem yourself well we could start with direct substitution to see if that's going to work so let's replace x with three so we're gonna have 12 minus three minus three divided by the square root of seven minus three minus two now twelve minus three is nine seven minus three is four the square root of nine is three and the square root of four is two so three minus three is zero the same is true for two minus two zero divided by zero we don't really know what that's going to be we don't know if that's going to be 1 infinity 0 undefined so this is indeterminate we can't do anything with this right now so we're going to need to do something else now when you want to evaluate a limit that has radicals and fractions what you want to do is you want to multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate of that radical the conjugate of the square root of seven minus x minus two is going to be the square root of seven minus x plus two so all you need to do is change the sign from negative to positive you simply need to reverse it now since we're multiplying the denominator of the fraction by this value we need to do the same thing with the numerator of the fraction so that the value of the entire fraction doesn't change that's just one of those rules of algebra that we need to follow now the numerator we're not going to do anything there we're not going to foil these two expressions so we're just going to rewrite it the way it is now the stuff that's on the bottom that's a different story we want to foil it because it will simplify the square root of 7 minus x times itself is simply just seven minus x the square root function will cancel now the square root of seven minus x times positive 2 that's going to cancel with negative 2 times the square root of 7 minus x but for this example problem i'm going to write it down so you can see it so we're going to have these two which will cancel and then finally negative two times two is negative four so that's what we have at this point two minus two is zero so those will disappear so let's simplify the result so we have the limit as x approaches 3 of the square root of 12 minus x minus 3 times the square root of 7 minus x plus 2 and then we have 7 minus x minus four now seven minus four is three so this simplifies to three minus x at this point we cannot use direct substitution if we were to plug in 3 into this expression we're going to get 3 minus 3 which is 0 and having a 0 in the denominator of a fraction will make the entire expression undefined so we can't do anything right now with that but there is something else that we can do and we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of this radical that was the radical that was in the beginning so we're going to multiply the top by the square root of 12 minus x but instead of minus 3 it's going to be plus 3. and whatever you do to the top you must also due to the bottom as well so now what we're going to do is we're going to foil those two factors so we're going to have the limit as x approaches 3. now the square root of 12 minus x times itself will simply be 12 minus x and then this is going to be plus 3 square root 12 minus x and then minus 3 square root 12 minus x and then negative 3 times 3 is negative 9. now these terms cancel and also we can see that 12 minus 9 is 3. so that whole expression becomes 3 minus x whoops let's go back okay why is this acting like this so we're going to have 3 minus x on top now we still have this expression the square root of seven minus x plus two on the bottom we have three minus x and the square root of twelve minus x plus three so we can cancel those two factors now at this point we could use direct substitution to get our final answer so this is going to be the square root of 7 minus 3 plus two divided by the square root of twelve minus three plus two now seven minus three is four twelve minus three is nine the square root of four is two the square root of nine i made a mistake this should be a three somehow that two became a three i wasn't paying attention the square root of nine is three now two plus two is four three plus three is six and so this is our answer but we need to reduce the fraction four is two times two six is two times three two divided by two is one and so we're left with two over three so this is the final answer two over three is basically 0.6 repeating now we can check our work by plugging in numbers into the original expression so let me rewrite the original problem it was the limit as x approaches 3 of the square root of 12 minus x minus 3 and then divided by the square root of 7 minus x minus 2. so this method that we're going to use to check our work is very useful if you have a multiple choice problem or multiple choice tests and you're not sure how to evaluate the limit if you're allowed to use the calculator plug-in numbers can always help you to evaluate the limit so as x approaches 3 what we want to do is plug in a number that's very close to 3. so let's say that this is f x let's evaluate that function at 3.1 so this is going to be the square root of 12 minus 3.1 and then minus 3 divided by the square root of 7 minus 3.1 minus 2. so go ahead and plug this in to your calculator so i got point six six four three two four one two seven one which is close to point six repeating but just to make sure we want to try another value we want to make sure that it's approaching 0.6 repeating so let's pick a number that is closer to 3. so a number that's closer to 3 as opposed to 3.1 would be 3.01 so go ahead and type this in so i got point six six six four three four nine one one five as you could see it's definitely getting close to point six repeating and if you really wanna be sure you could tr you could try this number three point zero zero one so for this i got point six six six six four three five one five eight so clearly you can see a pattern here so that just confirms that the answer that we have is indeed correct so now you know how to evaluate a limit problem that has radicals in it we need to do is multiply the radical expression by its conjugate simplify and then evaluate the limit so that's it for this video thanks again for watching
