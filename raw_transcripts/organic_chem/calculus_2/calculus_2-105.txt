Transcript for: Related Rates - Gravel Dumped Into Conical Tank Problem
let's work on this particular related rates problem gravel falls off a conveyor belt onto a conical pile at a rate of 50 cubic feet per minute the diameter of the base of the cone is always five times the height of the power how fast is the height of the pile increasing when the pile is 12 feet high so let's draw a picture first so let's say this is the conveyor belt and we have some sand that's basically fallen off and it turns into a pow which forms the shape of a cone we need to determine how fast the height of this cone is changing so that's just a picture just to give you a visual illustration of what's happening here but let's focus on the shape of a cone so we have a circular base and it looks like this and so here we have the height of the cone let's call that h and this part is the radius of the cone and the diameter is going to be twice the length of the radius so we can say that d is equal to 2r now let's make a list of what we know what does the 50 cubic feet per minute represents any time you see cubic feet cubic meters cubic something it represents volume so this tells us the rate at which the volume is changing and so that is the quantity for dv dt it's 50 cubic feet per minute now we're told that the diameter of the base of the cone is always five times the height of the pile so the diameter which is d is always equal to 5 times h and d is 2r so we can say that 2r is equal to 5 times h now our goal in this problem is to determine the rate at which the height of the pile is changing when the pile is 12 feet high so we know that h is 12 and the rate at which the height is changing is represented by dhdt and that's what we're looking for in this problem so how can we calculate dhdt well first we need to relate the height to the volume because we have dv dt and we need to calculate dht the volume of a cone is represented by this equation it's 1 3 pi r squared times the height now if we try to differentiate this equation with respect to time we're going to have dr dt and the hdt so we're going to have two missing variables which we don't want to be in that situation therefore we need to get rid of this r and replace it with h fortunately we have an equation that relates r with h so solving for r let's divide both sides by 2 in that equation so r is equal to 5 over 2 times h so now let's replace r with 5 over 2 times h 5 squared is 25 2 squared is 4 and then we'll have h squared times h which is h cubed now let's go ahead and differentiate both sides with respect to time and i'm running out of space so let's just get rid of some stuff i'm always running out of space the derivative of v is going to be 1 times dv dt and then we can rewrite the constants so that's going to be 25 pi and here we have 3 times 4 which is 12. so 25 pi over 12 and the derivative of h cube is going to be 3 h squared times dh dt so now let's plug in everything that we have and let's calculate dht so dv dt that's 50 and h is 12 so this is going to be 12 squared and then dhdt so we could at least cancel a 12. that's good and so we have 50 is equal to 25 pi times 3 times 12 which is 36. now i'm going to divide both sides by 25 first because it goes nicely into 50. 50 divided by 25 is 2. so we have 2 is equal to 36 pi times dhdt now if we divide both sides by 36 pi we have dh dt is equal to 2 over 36 pi and 36 you can write it as 18 times 2. so we could cancel a 2. 2 divided by 2 is 1. so dhdt is going to be 1 over 18 pi with the units feet per minute and so that's the answer now let's work on another problem water is leaking out of an inverted conical tank at a rate of 7 500 cubic centimeters per minute the height of the tank is eight meters and it has a diameter of six meters at the top let's draw a picture so this is going to be the radius of the circle and then this is the diameter and here we have the height of the cone if the water level is falling at a rate of 15 centimeters per minute when the height of the water is 0.25 meters what is the rate at which water is flowing into the tank so we have water going into the tank and some of it is leaking out of the tank so we need to take into consideration those two things now the height of the cone or the height of the tank that's eight meters and we're told that the diameter is 6 meters at the top so d is 6 meters now the height of the water we're told is 0.25 meters so how can we find the rate at which water is flowing into the tank now we need to realize that the difference between let me start over the difference between the rate at which water is flowing into the tank minus the rate at which water is flowing out of the tank that's going to equal the net volume flow rate now this is what we need to solve for that's the rate at which water is flowing into the tank we have the rate at which it is leaking out of the tank that's 7 500 cubic centimeters per minute but how can we calculate this term because that's the part that we're missing so that's the net rate at which the volume of water inside the cone is changing we need to use this equation to calculate it the volume of a cone one third pi r cubed i mean pi r squared times h now let's write down what we know so we know the height of water in the cone is 0.25 meters we also know the rate at which the water level is falling and that's dhdt because the height is changing and because the height is decreasing it's going to be negative 15 centimeters per minute now notice that we have different units we have centimeters and we have meters now it's best to convert meters into centimeters because i really don't want to convert cubic centimeters into meters that's going to take more time so let's start with 0.25 meters one meter is equal to 100 centimeters so the unit meters will cancel 0.25 times 100 is 25 so h is 25 centimeters now notice that we don't have dr dt so we can't differentiate this function in this form because we'll have dv dt which we need to calculate we have the htt but we don't have drdt so we need to replace r with h how can we do that let's write a ratio between the height of the tank and the diameter so the height of the tank is eight meters and the diameter is six so if we cross multiply we're gonna have eight d is equal to six h and we know the diameter is twice the radius so if we replace d with 2r we're going to have 8 times 2 which is 16 so 16r is equal to 6h now we need to solve for r so we got to divide both sides by 16. so r is going to be 6h over 16. and if you divide both numbers by 2 we can say that r is 3h over 8. so let's replace r with three over eight times h three squared is 9 8 squared is 64. and then we have h squared times h which is h cubed one third of 9 is 3. so this is going to be 3 pi over 64 times h cubed so now in this form we could differentiate both sides with respect to t the derivative of v with respect to t that's going to be dv dt and then we're going to have the constant 3 pi over 64. and the derivative of h cube using the power rule is 3h squared and then times dhdt now it's important to understand that this is the net dv dt basically this value right here it tells us the net rate at which the volume of the water inside the cone is changing it's the difference between a rate of water flowing in and the rate of water flowing out so let's plug in what we know h is 25 and dh dt that's negative 15. now let's plug these numbers into the calculator so 3 pi times 3 times 25 squared times negative 15 divided by 64. so as a decimal dv dt the net value that's going to be negative 4142 and rounded to nearest whole number and it has the units cubic centimeters per minute keep in mind dhet is centimeters per minute and h is in centimeters but it's squared so now let's calculate this term so let's replace this value with negative 4142 and then we have dv dt the rate of water flowing in and the amount of water that's flowing out or the rate at which the volume of water is flowing out that's 7 500 so what we need to do is add 7 500 to both sides of the equation and so it's going to be negative 4142 plus 7 500. and so the final answer is 3358 so dv dt the rate at which water is flowing into the tank that's 3358 cubic centimeters per minute and the reason why it's positive is because this quantity will increase the volume of water whereas this quantity decreases the volume of water in the tank you
