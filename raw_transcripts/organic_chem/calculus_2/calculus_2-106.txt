Transcript for: Related Rates - Area of a Triangle
in this tutorial we're going to focus on related rate problems as it relates to triangles so let's start with this one the base of a right triangle is increasing at 3 centimeters per minute while the height of the triangle is increasing at a rate of 5 centimeters per minute how fast is the area of the triangle changing when the base and height are 8 centimeters and 10 centimeters long respectively so let's draw a picture so here we have a right triangle and this is the base of the right triangle this is the height the area of the right triangle is simply one half base times height now let's write down what we know so we know the base is eight centimeters and the height is 10 centimeters we also know the rate at which the base and the height are changing the base is increasing at three centimeters per minute and the height it's increasing at a rate of five centimeters per minute so with this information how can we determine how fast the area of the triangle is changing so basically what is da dt what's the value that corresponds to it now what we need to do is we need to differentiate this equation with respect to time so the derivative of a is one but times d a dt now how can we differentiate one half base times height the base and the height they're changing they don't have a fixed length and so they're variables not constants therefore we need to use the product rule now just recall let's say if you wish to differentiate f times g it's going to be the derivative of the first times the second plus the first part times the derivative of the second part so just keep that in mind let's say that f is one half times the base and g is going to be the height so f prime the derivative of the first part the derivative of one half b is one half times one and then the derivative of b is just one times db dt if we're differentiating with respect to time and then it's going to be times second part plus the first part times the derivative of the second part the derivative of h is 1 times dhdt so now we have everything that we need to calculate d80t so db dt that's 3 centimeters per minute and h is 10 and then b is 8 and then dhdt is 5. so ten times a half is five five times three is fifteen one half of eight is four four times five is twenty and then fifteen plus 20 is 35. now let's focus on the units so let me just get rid of this real quick what are the units for d80t so what's the unit for area we're dealing with centimeters but area is always in square units so this is going to be 35 square centimeters and for time the time is in minutes so it's going to be 35 square centimeters per minute if you look at db dt the unit was centimeters per minute and then for h it's going to be times centimeters and that will give you square centimeters per minute so there's different ways in which you can employ to find the unit for your final answer so that's it 35 square centimeters per minute now let's work on another problem a triangle has two sides of fixed length which are five meters and eight meters long the angle between the two sides is increasing at a rate of point 15 radians per minute how fast is the area of the triangle changing when the angle between the two sides is pi over three so let's draw a picture first now we don't have a right triangle so we're going to draw simply a generic triangle this is going to be angle a b and c across angle a we have side a and then across angle b is side b and then here we have side c so anytime you have a generic triangle this is what you want to draw and for this particular triangle we have this formula the area is equal to one half a b sine of angle c so all of the capital letters represents angles and the lowercase letters represents sides now let's make a list of what we know so we have two sides of fixed length five meters and eight meters let's call that a and b so we're gonna say a is five meters b is eight meters now we also know the angle between the two sides you can call it theta if you want or you can call it angle c let's call it angle c an angle c which is between those two side lamps a and b it's pi over three now we also have the rate at which the angle is changing and the angle between the two sides which is dc dt that's changing at a rate of point 15 radians per minute all we need to do now is calculate how fast the area of the triangle is changing now notice that we don't have d a d t and d b d t why is that not given to us why don't we have that and the reason is that a and b are not variables in this problem rather they're constants and the key expression that we need to focus on is those sides are of a fixed length because a and b do not change dadt is zero and db dt is zero so we don't have to worry about differentiating a and b we'll have to treat it as variables simply as constants and that's gonna make this problem a lot easier so let's go ahead and differentiate this equation with respect to time so the derivative of a is going to be d80t and then this is going to equal the constant based on the constant multiple rules so we could just rewrite that one half a b and then c is the variable so the derivative of sine c the derivative of sine is cosine so we're going to have cosine of angle c and then according to the chain rule you need to differentiate the inside function of sine so the derivative of c is one times dc dt now let's plug in what we know so a is five b is eight and then we have cosine of c or cosine of pi over three times dc dt which is point fifteen now eight times five is forty and half of forty is twenty cosine pi over three is one half so half of twenty is ten and ten times point fifteen is 1.5 now what are the units so we know this is going to be square units and the lengths are in meters so this is going to be square meters and then dt that's a unit of time we're dealing with minutes so it's square meters per minute so that's how fast the area is changing it's increasing by 1.5 square meters every minute so that means that in two minutes it's going to increase by three square meters in 10 minutes if we multiply by 10 minutes the unit minutes will cancel and so in 10 minutes it will increase by 15 square meters and that's basically it for this video so now you know how to find the rate at which the area is changing for a right triangle or just any regular triangle thanks for
