Transcript for: Integral of absolute value of x or abs(x)
today we're gonna talk about how to integrate the absolute value of X function now before you do so let's draw a graph of the absolute value of x and the graph looks like this so that's the function absolute value of x on the right side we have y is equal to positive x and on the left side y is equal to negative x so you can break it down this function into two parts so the absolute value of x is equal to X when X is greater than or equal to zero and it's equal to negative x on the left side when X is less than zero so thus we have the integral of two separate parts so we need to integrate X when X is greater than or equal to zero and negative x when it's a less than zero so we need to use the power rule the antiderivative of X is going to be x squared over two plus C so that's we're going to have 1/2 x squared plus C when X is equal to a greater than zero and the antiderivative of negative x is going to be negative 1/2 x squared plus C when X is less than zero and so this is the answer that's the integral of the absolute value of x
