Transcript for: Introduction to Related Rates
now before we start this problem let's go over a few basic things associated with related rates particularly derivatives you need to be familiar with implicit differentiation for instance what is the derivative of y Cub with respect to X the derivative of y Cub with respect to X is 3 y^2 * dydx now let's say if we want to differentiate s to the 4th power but with respect to R the derivative of s to the 4th power is going to be 4S Cub but times DS over Dr R let's say if we want to differentiate x to the 5th power with respect to X this will be 5 x 4th time DX over DX which will cancel and we'll simply get 5x 4 now if we want to differentiate x to the 5th with respect to time it's going to be 5 x 4th * DX DT and with related rates that's what you're doing you're going to differentiate the equation with respect to time so let's say if we differentiate with respect to time y to the 7th power this is going to be 7 y 6 * dydt so when dealing with related rates you're going to have things like dydt dxdt and something with DT in it depending on what the variable is because you're dealing with uh units of time when you're dealing with rates a rate is basically how fast something changes with respect to time now let's focus on this problem if x^2 + y^2 = 25 and DX over DT is 7 find dydt when X is 3 now it's always good to make a list of what you have and what you need to find so we know the value of x x is three but we don't know the value of y now we have the value of dxct that tells you how fast the variable X is changing with respect to time so that's postive 7 if it's positive that means that X is increasing with respect to time at this instant our goal is to find dydt so let's calculate the value of y first using this equation so x^2 + y^2 is 25 let's replace x with 3 and let's solve for y 3^2 is 9 and 25 5 - 9 is 16 now we need to take the square root of both sides the square root of 16 is four now it can be positive4 or it can be ne4 so we have two possible answers so I'm going to put plus or minus 4 now how can we calculate dydt using this equation what do you think we need to do at this point we need to find the derivative with respect to time so we have to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time the derivative of x^2 with respect to T is going to be 2x * DX DT and for y^2 is going to be something similar it's going to be 2 y * dydt 25 is a con Conant and the derivative of a constant is zero now we can plug everything in into this equation and get the answer now because there's two possible answers for y let's try both let's try positive 4 for now so X is 3 DX DT is 7 so that part won't change Y is going to be four and now let's see what dydt is going to be 2 * 3 is 6 and and 6 * 7 that's 42 2 * 4 is 8 and now let's move the 42 to the other side of the equation so 8 dydt is equal to 42 and then let's divide both sides by 8 now 42 over 8 if we divide by 2 this becomes 21 / 4 so dy over DT is equal to 21 over 4 when Y is pos4 now I almost made one little mistake and when I move the 42 from the left to the right it should now be42 so this is -21 over 4 when Y is positive4 now let's see what's going to happen when y is4 so this time I'm going to solve for dydt so let's take this term move it to the other side so I have 2 y dydt on the left on the right -2X DX DT so now let's divide both sides by 2 y so dydt will equal the twos will cancel so it's going to Bex * DX DT / y so X is still pos3 DX CT is 7 and Y this time is -4 3 * 7 is 21 and -21 / -4 is POS 21 over4 so the magnitude is the same the only difference is the sign is different so when Y is pos4 dydt is - 21 over4 and when Y is-4 dydt is a POS 21 over4 let's try another problem if x^2 + y^2 = z^2 DX DT = 3 and dydt = 5 find dzdt when X is equal to 8 and Y is 15 so let's write down what we know so X is 8 Y is 15 and we don't have the value of Z Now DX DT so that's positive3 d ydt is 5 and our goal in this problem is to calculate dzdt so let's calculate Z first using this formula x^2 + y^2 = z^2 so 8^ 2 + 15^ 2 is equal to z^2 8 * 8 is 64 15 * 15 is 225 and 64 + 2 25 that's 289 now let's take the square root of both sides so the square root of 289 is 17 so Z is equal to 17 now just like before Z could be plus or minus 17 but we're going to choose just positive 17 just to keep things simple let's not worry about the -7 value so let's calculate dzdt when Z is pos7 so first we need to differentiate both sides of this equation with respect to time the derivative of x^2 is 2X and then times DX DT and for y^2 it's going to be 2 y * dydt and then Z ^2 2 Z * dzdt so notice that we can divide each term by two so basically we can get rid of the two and now plug in what you know and solve for the missing variable so X is 8 and dxdt is three Y is five and dydt actually Y is 15 and dydt is 5 Z is 17 so let's calculate dzdt 8 * 3 is 24 and 15 * 5 10 * 5 is 50 5 * 5 is 25 50 and 25 adds up to 75 24 + 75 that's 99 and that's equal to 17 * dzdt now let's divide both sides by 17 so dzdt is 99 over 17 when Z is positive 17 and so this is just a basic introduction into related rates it helps you to focus on the analytical part of solving problems now for other problems you need to design the equation yourself you have to figure out what equation applies to certain situations and it's best to draw a picture so I'm going to post some other videos on related rates and you could take a look at those if you need help in that area so that's it for this video and uh thanks again for watching
