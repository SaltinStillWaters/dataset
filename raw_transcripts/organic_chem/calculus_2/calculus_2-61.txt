Transcript for: The Constant Multiple Rule For Derivatives
in this lesson we're going to go over the constant multiple rule for derivatives so here's what you need to know the derivative of a constant times the function is equal to the constant times the derivative of the function so all you need to do is find the derivative and multiply it by that constant so let me give an example let's say if we want to differentiate 3x to the fifth power now the constant is three the function of x is x to the fifth now you can differentiate x to the fifth using the power rule so let's rewrite the constant three and let's take the derivative of x to the fifth power if you recall the derivative of a variable raised to a constant like x to the fifth is n times x raised to the n minus one so that's going to be 5 times x raised to the 5 minus 1. now 5 minus 1 is 4 and now we can multiply the 5 by the 3. 3 times 5 is 15. and so this will give us 15 x to the fourth power and that's the answer go ahead and try these examples find the derivative of 4x to the seventh power and also differentiate 5x to the 9th power using the constant multiple rule so the constant is 4. and we need to differentiate x to the seventh power so using the power rule it's going to be seven x raised to the seven minus one 7 minus 1 is 6 and then 4 times 7 is 28 so it's going to be 28 x to the sixth power now for the next example we have a constant of 5 and we need to find the derivative of x to the ninth power so it's going to be nine x raised to the nine minus one and nine minus one is eight and five times nine 9 is 45 so we get 45 x to the a power so that's a simple way in which you can use the constant multiple rule in order to find the derivative of a function now what is the derivative of x divided by seven what do you think we need to do for that particular problem so we have a fraction we have a variable divided by a constant what should we do if you're confused by this problem you don't need to be it's not that hard you just have to see it from a different perspective let's rewrite the expression this expression is equivalent to 1 over 7 times x so now it's very similar to this problem like the first three problems that we did for example if i want to find the derivative of 5x to the seventh power i have a constant times a variable this is just what i have here this is going to be 5 times 7 x raised to the 7 minus 1 and that's 5 times 7 x raised to the 6 5 times 7 is 35 so i'm going to follow the exact process all i need to do in this problem is to separate the x and the seven so the constant is one over seven so this is going to equal the constant times the derivative of the function and this is x to the first power so if we use the power rule it's going to be 1 x raised to the 1 minus 1. 1 minus 1 is 0. so we have x to the 0 power anything raised to the zero power is one so one over seven times one is simply one over seven so that is the derivative of x divided by seven here's another one you could try what is the derivative of x cubed divided by 15. let's go ahead and get the answer for that one so first let's rewrite it so the constant in this example is 1 over 15 and it's multiplied by x cubed so using the constant multiple rule it's going to be 1 over 15 times the derivative of x cubed which is 3 x to the three minus one three minus one is two and so it's going to be three x squared divided by fifteen now keep in mind 15 is 3 times 5 and 3 divided by 3 is 1 so we can cancel the 3. so you can write your final answer as x squared over 5 or you can write it as 1 5 times x squared now what about this example what is the derivative of negative seven x to the sixth divided by four go ahead and try that so let's separate the variable from the constant so the constant is negative seven over four it's a fraction and the variable or the function f of x is x to the sixth power so we're gonna rewrite the constant and differentiate x to the sixth power which is going to be six x to the fifth power six minus one is five negative seven times six is negative 42 so we have negative 42 x to the fifth power divided by four now we could simplify 42 over four 42 is 21 times two and four is two times two so we can cancel a two so the final answer is negative 21 x to the fifth power divided by two now let's apply the constant multiple rule with square root functions so what is the derivative of 4 square root x so we can clearly see that the constant is 4. but we need to rewrite the square root function the square root of x is x raised to the one half and we need to use the power rule on that expression so it's going to be the constant times the derivative of x to the one-half which is going to be one-half x raised to the n minus one or one-half minus one now one-half minus one if you get common denominators one is basically two over two so one over two minus two over two is negative one over two now we can multiply four and a half half of four is two so we have two x to the negative one half now we need to convert the negative exponent into a positive exponent and we can do so if we take the variable x and move it to the bottom so this is equal to two divided by x to the one half now we know that x to one half is basically the square root of x so the final answer is two divided by the square root of x and that's it let's use the constant multiple rule with rational functions so differentiate 5 divided by x now just like the other problem we need to rewrite this expression so i'm going to take the x variable and move it to the top right now it's x to the 1 power on the bottom but it's going to be x to the negative 1 when x is in the numerator so we can see that the constant is 5 f of x is x to the negative 1. so now let's differentiate x to the negative 1 power using the power rule so it's negative 1 x to the negative one minus one and negative one minus one is negative two so five times negative one that's going to be negative five now let's move the variable to the bottom so we can convert the negative exponent into a positive exponent so this is equal to negative 5 over x squared and that is the answer now what about this one what is the derivative of five divided by two and let's say it's the seventh root of x to the fourth go ahead and try that so let's separate the constant from the variable so the constant is five over two and it's multiplied by one over the seventh root of x to the fourth now before we could find the derivative of that expression we need to rewrite it so first let's convert it from radical form to exponential form the seventh root of x to the fourth is x raised to the four over seven now if you need some more examples the ninth root of x to the fifth is x to the five over nine the fourth root of x cubed is x to the three fourths just in case if you have a question about how i got that answer now we need to move the variable to the top so this is going to be 5 over 2 times x raised to the negative 4 over 7. and now we can find the derivative of this expression using the power rule so this is going to be 5 over 2 and then we're going to take the exponent move it to the front so that's going to be negative 4 over 7 times x and then we need to subtract the exponent by one so what's negative four over seven minus one one is the same as seven over seven and negative four minus seven is negative eleven so what we now have is five over two times negative four over seven x to the negative eleven over seven 5 times negative 4 is negative 20 and 2 times 7 is 14. and so this is what we now have now i'm going to convert this back into radical form but first i'm going to take the variable and move it to the bottom right now we have this expression negative 20 x to the negative 11 over 7 divided by 14 but that's equivalent to negative 20 over fourteen x to the positive eleven over seven now twenty is basically ten times two and fourteen is seven times two so we can get rid of a two and at the same time we can convert this back into its radical form where it's the seventh root of x to the eleventh power so the final answer is negative 10 divided by seven and then the seventh root of x to 11. that's it now i'm sure someone is going to ask me if we could simplify this expression further and it turns out that we can so i'm going to go ahead and do that so this is going to be negative 10 over 7 and then i'm going to break down x 11 as x to the seven and x to the four because four plus seven is eleven and i'm going to separate this radical into two radicals so the first one is the seventh root of x to the seventh and the second one is seventh root of x to the fourth now because these two both contain a seven seven divided by 7 is 1. and so the final answer fully simplified is negative 10 divided by 7 times x multiplied by the 7th root of x to the fourth power and that is it if you want to rationalize the expression you can but i don't think it's necessary but if you want to here's what you could do you can multiply the top and the bottom by the center fruit of x cubed if you really want to take it to the next level and so it's going to be negative 10 7 fruit x cubed over 7x x to the fourth times x cubed is x to the seventh power so you have the seventh root of x to the seventh which is about to be simplified into another x so these sevens will cancel and we're going to get another x and so you can also write your answer as negative 10 seventh root of x cubed divided by seven x squared if you're told to rationalize any radicals in the denominator you
