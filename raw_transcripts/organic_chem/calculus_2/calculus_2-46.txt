Transcript for: Limits and Logarithms
here's a question for you how would you evaluate this limit what is the limit as n goes to infinity of a 1 plus 1 over n raised to the n power well in this video we're going to talk about how to evaluate this limit so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to set the entire expression equal to y so our goal is to solve for y if we can do that we could find the value of this expression now the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to take the natural log of both sides so we're going to have ln y is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity and then the natural log of 1 plus 1 over n raised to the n now a property of logs let's say we have log x raised to the a we can take the exponent and move it to the front so ln x raised to the a power is a times ln x so we're going to take this variable move it to the front so we're going to have the natural log of y is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity n times the natural log of one plus one over n now we still have some more work to do here right now we have the product of two expressions n times ln one plus one over n we need to convert this expression from being a product of two expressions to a quotient of two expressions and here's how we can do that for instance a times b is equal to b divided by one over a so here we have a product of two expressions now we have a quotient of two expressions you can illustrate this with real numbers four times five which is twenty is equivalent to five divided by one fourth they both equal twenty so based on that we're going to convert this expression from n times the natural log of 1 plus 1 over n to ln 1 plus 1 over n divided by 1 over n the mathematically equivalent so now in this format we could use something called a l'hopital's rule which is useful for evaluating limits that approach infinity so we're going to take the derivative of the top and of the bottom let's start with the numerator the derivative of the natural log of u is equal to u prime over u so since the u variable is going to be the stuff inside of the natural log function that's going to be 1 plus 1 over n u prime is going to be the derivative of that expression the derivative of 1 is 0. now the derivative of 1 over n first we need to rewrite that as n to the minus one and then we need to use the power rule so it's going to be negative one n to the minus two and then we can rewrite that as negative one over n squared so using the formula u prime over u we're going to have ln y is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity and the derivative of that expression is going to be u prime which is negative 1 over n squared divided by u which is what we see here that's 1 plus 1 over n and all of that is divided by the derivative of one over n which is this again negative one over n squared whoa what just happened now let's get rid of that now the next thing that we need to do is cancel the two negative signs a negative divided by a negative sign is a positive sign and then we can multiply the numerator by n squared and the denominator by n squared so one over n squared times n squared this is just one and this becomes one so in the end we're going to get the natural log of y is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity this is one divided by one plus one over n all divided by one which we don't really need to write that so this is the expression that we now have now as n goes to infinity what happens to one over n let's say n is ten one divided by ten is point one if n increases to a hundred one divided by a hundred is .01 as n increases to a thousand one divided by a thousand is point zero zero one as n gets larger and larger one over n gets smaller and smaller as you can see it's getting close to zero so as n goes to infinity one over n approaches zero so applying this limit expression we can replace one over n with zero so we're gonna have ln y is equal to one over one plus zero which is basically one so the natural log of y is equal to one now the base of a natural log function is equal to e that's important because that's going to help us get the answer that we need here's a property of logs that you need to be familiar with log base a of b let's say that's equal to c to convert this from a logarithmic expression into an exponential expression here's what you can do a race to c is equal to b now applying that same process to the expression that we have in the upper right corner we could say that e raised to the first power is equal to one so therefore y is equal to e now going back to the original problem where we had this we said that y was equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of 1 plus 1 over n raised to the n because that's equal to y and y is equal to e this limit expression is equal to e so this right here is the answer to the problem so that's how you can get the number e e is equal to 2.71828 1 8 2 8 and then that continues on we can plug in numbers to get this result for instance let's make n equal to a large number let's say a thousand so if you type this in your calculator one plus one over a thousand raised to a thousand this is what you're going to get you're gonna get two point seven one six nine two three nine three two which is close to this answer but not quite now let's increase n from a thousand to a million a million is basically one times ten to the sixth it's easier to type it that way so if you plug in this number you're going to get one 2.718 two eight zero four six nine so this is really getting close to e now let's try one more let's try a billion a billion is one times ten to the nine so this is a very large number and this will give you at least according to my calculator 2.718281827 so the only thing that's different here is the last eight and the last seven but it's very very close so you can clearly see that as n gets larger and larger as an increase in let me say that again as n increases in value this entire expression approaches e and so that's one way in which we can get the number e using limits and natural logs so that's basically it for this video that's all i got and if you like this video don't forget to
