Transcript for: Calculus - Integration By Parts
here is a question for you how do you find the indefinite integral of that we have a three product term expression how do you integrate that perhaps you're familiar with integration by parts and you've seen this formula the integral of u dv is equal to u times v minus the integral of vdu now this works for a two product term expression but what about a three product term expression well before we can derive the formula that will help us get the answer let's talk about how we can derive this formula because if we can understand that process we can apply it to a three product term expression we need to start with the product rule the integration by parts is basically a reverse or the reverse process of finding the derivative using the product rule so let's say we have a two product term expression u times v the derivative of u times v is going to be you take the derivative of the first part u which becomes u prime times v plus u times the derivative of the second part v prime so that's the product rule now u prime if we differentiate it with respect to x is going to be d u d x and v prime is going to be dv over dx so what i'm going to do at this point is multiply every term by dx so i now have uv prime dx is equal to v d u plus u dv so at this point what i'm going to do now is i'm going to move this term to the other side so i have uv prime dx minus vdu is equal to u dv now i'm going to reverse the equation i'm going to take this move it to the other side and this move it to that side so reversing the equation we're basically just switching it i have u dv is equal to uv prime dx minus v du so now let's take the integral of both sides so this becomes the integral of u dv the integral of uv prime is just going to be uv because here you're taking the derivative and then you're integrating it which are basically reverse processes of each other so it's like a double reverse so you just get u v minus the integral of v to u so that's a simple way in which we can derive the integration by parts formula from the product rule of finding derivatives now let's apply that same process to a three product term expression so let's find the derivative of u v w so first we need to differentiate the first part so we're going to get u prime leaving the other two the same next we need to differentiate the second part that is v so that's going to be v prime leaving u and w the same and then we're going to differentiate the third part leaving the first two variables the same so that's how we could find the derivative of the three product term expression so now at this point let's replace u prime with du dx and we're going to replace v prime with dv dx and w prime with dw dx and like before we're going to multiply every term by dx so these will cancel and so we're going to get u v w prime times dx and that's going to equal v w d u plus u w d v plus uv dw now i'm going to take these two terms and move it to the other side so i'm going to have u v w prime d x minus v w d u minus u w d v and that's going to equal u v d w and i'm going to reverse both equations so we're going to have u v d w is equal to u v w prime times d x minus v w d u minus u w dv now we're gonna integrate every expression or integrate both sides of the equation so the final answer is this the integral of u v dw is going to be this becomes just uvw minus the integral of v w d u minus the integral of u w dv so this is the integration by parts formula for a three product term expression so let's apply this formula to the original problem so we have the integral of x sine x e to the 2x dx so u is going to equal x v is going to be sine x dw is going to be e to the 2 x dx so if u is equal to x d u is going to be the derivative of x which is 1 times dx which we can simply write as dx v is equal to sine x the derivative of sine x is cosine x so dv is going to be cosine x dx dw is e to the 2x dx the anti-derivative of e to the 2x is going to be e to the 2x divided by 2. the derivative of 2x is 2. so now this is going to be uvw so that's x sine x times w which is e to the 2x over 2 minus the integral of v which is sine times w which is e to the 2x over 2 times dv which is dx minus the integral of u which is x times w times dv dv is cosine x dx so we have a lot of integrals to deal with here but what we're going to do now is we're going to focus on this integral that we see here so that is one half the integral i took the two and move it to the front so there's the one half symbol one half the integral x e to the two x cosine x dx now we need to use this formula again so we're going to make u equal to x so d u is dx again and let me rewrite it i'm going to write it as x cosine x e to the 2x so v is going to be cosine the derivative of cosine is negative sign and then dw is e to the 2x dx so w is going to be the same thing e to the 2x divided by 2. so now let's put it together so we have uvw that's x cosine x e to the two x over two minus the integral of v w d u v is cosine w is e to the two x over two and d u is d x and then minus the integral of u w d v u is x w is e to the two x over two and dv is negative sine x dx so notice that this expression is similar to the original one so therefore we can combine those two integrals later so we just need to worry about this one but now let's move on and deal with this integral it's a two product term expression so we're going to have one half the integral of sine x e to the 2x so we're going to use this formula the integral of u dv is equal to uv minus the integral of vdu so u is going to be sine x d u is going to be the derivative of sine which is cosine x dx dv is going to be e to the 2 x dx and so v is e to the 2 x over 2. so this becomes u times v so that's one half sine x e to the two x minus the integral of v to u so that's e to the two x over two times d u which is cosine x dx so notice that eventually we're going to be able to combine these two expressions so at this point what we want to do right now is take these terms and plug it in to their respective formulas now one thing that we have yet to do is distribute the one half so let's go ahead and do that now so multiplying everything by a half this becomes one-fourth and this becomes e to the two x over four now we need to do the same with this expression so let's replace all the twos with a four so this would equate to dividing every term by 2 or multiplying it by a half so now the original expression x sine x e to the 2x dx is going to equal this so that's one half x sine x e to the 2x and then minus now replacing this expression with what we see here it's going to be minus 1 4 sine x e to the 2x and minus minus that expression so that's going to be plus 1 4 the integral of cosine x e to the 2x and let's not forget dx so now we can move on to this one we do have a negative sign so keep that in mind so it's going to be minus so we're going to replace this with everything that we see here so it's minus that term so that's going to be 1 4 x cosine e to the 2x and then we have minus and another minus so that's going to be positive which i'm going to put right under this expression because we can add them so positive 1 4 integral cosine x e to the 2 x and then we have minus minus minus 3 negatives that's a negative so minus let's move the 4 to the front 1 4 the integral of x sine x e to the 2 x dx so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to take this and move it to the left side of the equation so we have 1 plus 1 4 that's 4 over 4 plus 1 over 4 which is 5 over 4. so 5 over 4 integral x sine x e to the two x dx is going to equal one half x sine x e to the two x minus one fourth sine x e to the two x one fourth plus one fourth is a half so plus one half integral cosine x e to the two x dx and then minus one fourth x cosine x e to the two x so now let's eliminate this and let's focus on this integral the integral of cosine x e to the 2x dx we'll deal with the one-half later so we're going to make u equal to let's put this on the bottom here let's make u equal to cosine x so d u will be negative sine x dx and dv is e to the 2x dx so v is going to be e to the 2x divided by 2. so using the formula for two product term expression it's going to be the integral of udv is uv minus the integral of vdu so u times v that's going to be one half cosine x e to the two x minus the integral of v d u so this is v this is d u that's going to be negative sine x e to the 2 x over 2 dx so the two negative signs will cancel that's going to be positive and we can move the one half to the front so this becomes plus one half the integral of sine x e to the 2x dx now we need to use integration by parts one more time so this time we need to make u equal to sine x d u is going to be cosine x dx and dv is going to be the same so this is equal to one half cosine x e to the two x plus one half and now let's apply this formula so it's uv that's going to be one half sine x e to the 2x minus the integral of v to u which is one half cosine x e to the 2x dx now let's put this all together so the integral of cosine e to the 2x dx is going to be one-half cosine x times e to the two x and then one half times one half that's going to be plus one fourth sine x e to the two x and then we have one-half times negative one-half so that's negative one-fourth integral cosine x e to the two x dx so now we can combine these two expressions so add in 1 4 integral cosine x e to the 2x this is going to be 1 plus 1 4. so we have 5 over 4 integral cosine x e to the 2 x dx which is equal to this now we're not trying to solve for 5 over 4 cosine x e to the 2x we want to find the value of just one of it so to turn this back into a 1 we need to multiply everything by 4 over 5. so the 4's cancel the 5's cancel and we're going to get our original expression four over five times one over two four over two is two so this becomes two over five cosine x e to the two x here the fours cancel so that becomes one over five sine x e to the two x so the integral of cosine x e to the two x is two over five cosine x to e to the two x plus 1 over 5 sine x e to the 2x so we need to replace this expression with what we have here and then combine like terms so 5 over 4 integral x sine x e to the 2 x dx that's going to be one half x sine x e to the 2 x minus 1 4 sine x e to the 2 x and then we have plus one half times everything here so times two over five cosine x e to the two x and then plus one half times this that's times one over five sine x e to the two x and then that one minus one fourth x cosine x e to the two x so we can combine those expressions so that is negative 1 4 plus this is 1 over 10. so getting common denominators so we need to get to 20. we're going to multiply that by 2 over 2 and this by 5 over 5. so we get negative 5 over 20. plus 2 over 20 which becomes negative 3 over 20. in case you're wondering why the screen looks a little different there's no cause for concern i just had to do some video editing so let's put everything together at this point so these expressions combined we said it's negative 3 over twenty sine x e to the two x and then these will cancel so we're gonna get plus one over five cosine x e to the two x and then minus one fourth x cosine x e to the two x now we need to replace the five over four with a one so we're going to multiply every expression by four over five so the fours will cancel the fives will cancel on the left we're going to get the integral of x sine x e to the two x these will cancel four divided by two is two so this will give us two over five x sine x e to the two x three over twenty times four over five that requires some work twenty can be written as four over five and so we can cancel the 4 which will give us 3 over 25 and then we can multiply these two four over five times one over five that's going to be four over 25 cosine x e to the two x and then these will cancel giving us negative one over five x cosine x e to the two x plus c so thus we have our final answer which i'm gonna write on the top of the screen because we're going to check our work soon so the integral of x sine x e to the 2 x dx is equal to 2 over 5 x sine x e to the 2x and then minus 3 over 25 sine x e to the 2x minus 1 over 5 x cosine x e to the 2 x and then plus 4 over 25 cosine x e to the 2 x plus c so this is the final answer so that's how you could find the indefinite integral of a three product term expression using integration by parts now in order to make sure that this answer is indeed correct we're going to take the derivative of the right side of the equation and make sure we get what is on the left side so let's take the derivative of the first term 2 over five x sine x e to the two x so we're going to use the product rule given this three term expression first we're gonna differentiate the first part two over five x the derivative of x is one so it's two over five times one and then we're just going to multiply by the other two products sine x e to the two x next we're going to leave the first part the same we're going to take the derivative of the second part the derivative of sine is cosine and we're going to leave the third part the same for the last one we're going to differentiate the third part which is e to the 2x times two leaving these two the same so two times this will be four over five x sine x and then e to the 2x now let's take the derivative of the next term that is of negative 3 over 25 sine x e to the 2x so we need to use the product rule again but for a two product term expression let's say this is u this is v so the derivative of the first part is going to be negative 3 over 25 times the derivative of sine which is cosine and we're going to leave the second part the same next we need to differentiate this part e to the 2x which is just e to the two x times two so negative three over twenty five times two that's gonna be negative six over twenty five sine x e to the two x now moving on to the next term the next one is going to be negative one over five x cosine x e to the two x so we have a three product term expression the derivative of negative one over five x is just negative one over five and then we're gonna have cosine times e to the two x the derivative of cosine is negative sine so this is going to be positive one over five x sine x e to the two x and the derivative of e to the two x is the same thing times two so it's gonna be negative two over five x cosine x e to the 2x now for the last one 4 over 25 cosine x e to the 2x we have a two product term expression the derivative of cosine is negative sign so we're going to have negative 4 over 25 sine x e to the 2x and then the derivative of e to the 2x is going to be that times 2 so 4 times 2 that would be 8 over 25 cosine x e to the 2x so what we're going to do is add these terms and see if we get this so let's think about what cancels so these two terms cancel let's see what else let's focus on d stream negative 3 over 25 negative one over five if you multiply that by five over five you get negative five over twenty five plus eight over twenty five that adds to zero so therefore we can cancel these three terms now let's talk about these numbers here two over five multiplying that by 5 over 5 that's going to give us 10 over 25 and then we have minus 6 over 25 minus 4 over 25 that's going to give us 0 as well so we could cancel these those three terms so what we have left over is the sum of these two four over five plus one over five is five over five which is just one so we get one x sine x e to the two x which is our original expression so therefore this is indeed the correct answer so that is the integral or the antiderivative of x sine x e to the 2x so now you know how to apply the integration by parts formula when you're dealing with a three product term expression so that's it for this video thanks again
