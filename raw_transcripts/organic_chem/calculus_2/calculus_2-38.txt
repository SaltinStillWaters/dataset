Transcript for: Limits of Exponential Functions | Calculus
here's a question for you what is the limit as x approaches 0 of the expression 4 raised to the 3x minus 3 raised to the 4x divided by x feel free to take a minute if you want to try this problem yourself so we could start with direct substitution let's replace x with zero three times zero is zero and four times zero is zero now what is four raised to the zero power anything raised to the zero power is one so four to the zero is one three to the zero is one 1 minus 1 is 0. and 0 divided by 0 we really don't know what that is that could be 0 it could be infinity it could be 5 it could be negative 8. we just don't know so this is called indeterminate we can't determine what it is now whenever you have one of the indeterminate types such as zero over zero or infinity over infinity and when you're dealing with limits you could use something called l'hopital's rule or l'hopital's rule and what you need to do in order to apply l'hopital's rule is you need to take the derivative of the numerator and of the denominator separately you're not using the chain rule or i mean i meant to say the quotient rule you're not using that here you just need to differentiate the numerator of the fraction and the denominator of the fraction separately so what is the derivative of 4 raised to the 3x to find the derivative of a constant raised to a variable let's say a to the u it's equal to the same thing a to the u times the derivative of the exponent u prime times the natural log of the constant a so the derivative of 4 to the 3x is going to be 4 to the 3x times the derivative of 3x which is 3 times the natural log of 4. likewise the derivative of 3 to the 4x is going to be the same thing 3 to the 4x times the derivative of the exponent 4x which is 4 times the natural log of the base which is ln 3. and then the derivative of x is 1. now i need to rewrite my limit expression so we still have the limit as x approaches zero and now at this point we could use direct substitution because we're not going to get zero over zero anymore so replacing x with 0 we're going to have 4 raised to the 0 power times 3 times ln 4 minus 3 raised to the 0 power times 4 times ln 3 and divided by 1 is the same thing as the expression that we currently have so 4 to the 0 power is 1 leaving behind 3 ln 4 and 3 to the 0 power is 1. and so we get 4 ln 3. now let's get the decimal value of these expressions so 3 times the natural log of 4 that's 4.15883083 then 4 ln 3 that's 4.394449155 so subtracting those two numbers or simply just type in three l and four minus four l and three gives us this result negative point two three five five six six zero seven so this is i guess it's a rounded answer but this is the exact answer if you want to leave it in that form but that's how you can evaluate this exponential or this limit involving exponential expressions now let's make sure the work is correct so what we're going to do is we're going to substitute values into this expression so as x approaches 0 let's see what's going to happen let's plug in a small number like 0.1 4 raised to the 3 times point one minus three raised to the four times point one divided by point one so i got negative point three six one two nine now let's try another one let's try point zero zero one let's see what happens as x get very close to 1. so 4 raised to the 3 times 0.001 and then minus 3 raised to the 4 times that value divided by zero one so for this i got negative point two three six five seven which is close if you try an even closer number you're going to get a more accurate result so for this i got negative point two three five five seven six so as you can see as x gets closer and closer to zero it's going to approach this answer which means this answer is indeed correct now let's try one more example it's going to be similar to the previous example so let's say we have the limit as x approaches 0 of e to the x minus e raised to the negative x and this is going to be divided by x so for the sake of practice feel free to try this problem based on what we did in the last problem so let's begin using direct substitution we're gonna have e to the zero minus e to the negative zero which is still zero divided by zero so e to the zero is one and once again we're going to get zero over zero so we have an indeterminate type thus we need to use l'hopital's rule so let's take the derivative of the numerator and of the denominator so what is the derivative of e to the x so using this formula the derivative of a to the u is going to be a to the u times u prime times ln a so the derivative of e to the x e is a constant x is the variable it's going to be e c x times the derivative of x which is one times the natural log of e the natural log of e is equal to one so all of that is simply equal to e to the x the derivative of e to the negative x is going to be the same thing e to the negative x times the derivative of negative x which is negative 1 times ln e ln e is one so this just equals negative e to the negative x so the derivative of e to the x is the same thing e to the x minus the derivative of e to the negative x which is negative e to the negative x all divided by one now the two negative signs can be cancelled so we could change that to a positive sign and then at this point we could use direct substitution so it's e to the zero plus e to the zero or negative zero divided by one e to the 0 is 1. so we have 1 plus 1 divided by 1 which is 2 over 1. so the answer is 2. so that is the limit as x approaches 0 of e to the x minus e to the negative x over x now to confirm our answer let's plug in 0.1 for x let's see what we get using the original expression so e to the point one minus e to the negative point one divided by point one this is equal to two point zero zero three three three five which is very close to two so we don't have to try a smaller number like point zero one this is good enough but we can see that the answer is indeed two and so that's it for this video so now you know how to find the limit of exponential functions now for those of you who want other examples like more videos on limits let's say limits of inverse trig functions or rational functions or just other topics involving limits i'm going to post some videos i mean some links to those other videos in the description section below in this video so if you're interested in more problems feel free to take a look at that when you get a chance and that's it so thanks again for watching this video and don't forget to subscribe to this channel
