Transcript for: Midpoint Rule & Riemann Sums
in this video we're going to go over some examples dealing with the midpoint rule so let's begin so let's say if we have the graph y equals x squared and let's graph it so it looks something like this we're just going to focus on the right side of this graph now let's determine the area under the curve from 0 to 8. let's see if we can estimate it using the midpoint rule and we're going to break it into four subintervals to calculate the length of each sub-interval you can use this formula delta x is b minus a divided by n so we want to find the area over the closed interval from zero to eight so a is zero b is eight so eight minus zero divided by four is two so the left of each sub interval is two so that's delta x by the way before watching this video i recommend watching my other video on riemann sums left endpoints and right endpoints and you could find it in my new calculus video playlist or you could search it in youtube so let's continue now what we're going to do is we're going to draw four rectangles using the midpoint rule and you need to draw the rectangles starting from the midpoint of zero and two which is here and the midpoint of two and four which is three the midpoint of four and six that's five and the midpoint of six and eight that's seven so we're going to draw a rectangle where the line intersects that point so a portion of the rectangle will be outside of the curve and a portion of it will be inside or within the curve so the midpoint rule it calculates the area of those four rectangles and it approximates the area under the curve from zero to eight now as you can see there's some parts that has not been accounted for in white and also there's some parts that have been that shouldn't be accounted for also in white and so the midpoint rule is a good approximation for estimating the area under curve compared to the area using the left endpoints and the right endpoints to calculate the area of each rectangle we need to multiply the width of the rectangle which is delta x times the height of each rectangle which is the y value that corresponds to a certain x value or you could say that's basically f x at some sample point x or x sub i the area is going to be the width which is the same for each rectangle times the height of all the rectangles so we're going to sum up the individual heights for each rectangle starting from 1 to some value n now n is 4 in this example because it's 4 rectangles we need to do is create a number line so going from a to b 0 to 8 and it's 4 sub intervals this is the first sub interval this is the second one the third and the fourth one now if you were to calculate the area using the left endpoints we need to choose four out of the five points listed so that would be zero two four and six for an increasing function that would be an under approximation or a lower sum if we were to calculate the area using the right endpoints we would use 2 4 6 and 8 so this would lead to an over approximation or an upper sum for this example but using the midpoint rule we're going to get the points in the middle of each sub interval so that's going to be at 1 3 5 and 7. so the area is going to be delta x times the sum of all of those the heights of the rectangles so it's going to be at 1 and 3 5 and 7. so it's the midpoint of each sub interval now we know that delta x is 2 and f of 1 we know that f of x is x squared for this example so this is gonna be one squared which is one three squared is nine five squared is twenty-five and this is supposed to be a seven i don't know why i put a six here seven squared is forty-nine so first let's add one and 49 one plus 49 that's going to be 50 and then 9 plus 25 is 34. 50 plus 34 is 84. and 2 times 84 is 168. so this is the area using the midpoint rule let's see how close we are to the actual answer so to calculate the actual answer the exact area under the curve is simply equal to the definite integral evaluated over that interval so it's going to be from 0 to 8 x squared dx the antiderivative of x squared using the power rule it's x cubed over three evaluated from zero to eight so this is going to be eight to the third over three minus zero to the third over three eight to the third is 5 12 and 512 divided by 3 is 170.67 so as you can see the midpoint rule is a good approximation of the actual area under the curve now let's try another example let's say we have the function x to the third and i want you to estimate the area under the curve over the closed interval zero to ten and choose five rectangles you can break down that interval into five sub intervals so go ahead and use the midpoint rule first and then calculate the definite integral from 0 to 10 to see if the answers are close to each other so let's start with a graph so x cubed has a similar shape as x squared the only difference is it rises faster so we need to calculate the area of the shaded region so let's start with the midpoint rule so let's create a number line from 0 to 10 and let's calculate delta x so delta x is going to be b minus a over n a is 0 b is 10. so this is going to be ten minus zero divided by five which is two so these numbers will differ by two now to use the midpoint rule we need to get the midpoint of each sub interval so that's at 1 3 5 7 and 9. so the area is going to equal delta x times the sum of f of x at these different values going from 1 to five so we're gonna have five values because n is five now delta x we calculate it to be two and then this is going to be times f of one plus f of three and then f of five plus f of seven plus f of nine now f of x is x cubed so this is going to be one to the third power which is one three to the third power that's 27 5 cubed five times five times five is 125 and then seven to the third power that's 343 and then 9 raised to the third power is 729 so go ahead and plug those numbers in your calculator 1 plus 27 plus 125 plus 343 plus 729 that's 1225. if you multiply that by 2 this is 2450. so that's the area using the midpoint rule that's the approximation for the area under the curve now let's get the actual area by calculating the definite integral of x cubed from 0 to 10. so the anti-derivative of x raised to the third power is going to be x to the fourth power divided by four so this is going to be ten to the fourth power over four minus zero to the fourth power over four if we multiply ten ten i mean four times ten times ten is a hundred times ten is a thousand times another ten that's going to be ten thousand so it's one with four zeros and ten thousand divided by four is twenty five hundred and so twenty four and 2500 they're pretty close to each other they're not too far apart and so as you can see the midpoint rule is a very good approximation of the area under the curve you could use it to estimate the value of a definite integral you
