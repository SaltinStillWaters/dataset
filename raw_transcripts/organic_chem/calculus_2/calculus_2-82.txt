Transcript for: Quotient Rule For Derivatives
let's say if we want to find the derivative of this function seven x plus four divided by x squared plus five how can we do so how can we find the derivative of a function in a fraction so we need to use something called the quotient rule and here's the formula that you need to be familiar with the derivative of f divided by g is equal to g times f prime minus f times g prime divided by g squared so f is the numerator of the fraction and g is the denominator so we could say that f is equal to seven x plus four and g is equal to x squared plus five so what's f prime and what's g prime f prime the derivative of f that's going to be the derivative of seven x plus four the derivative of seven x is just seven and the derivative of any constant is zero now for g prime the derivative of x squared plus 5 is 2x so using this formula this is going to be equal to g where g is x squared plus 5. multiplied by f prime and so that's seven and then minus f which is seven x plus four times g prime which is 2x divided by g squared and g squared is x squared plus 5 but squared so now let's get rid of this now some teachers will allow you to leave your answer like this because this represents the derivative of this expression other teachers will want you to go further and simplify it so we're going to do that in this example let's distribute the seven so x squared times seven is seven x squared and then we have seven times five which is thirty five now two x times negative 7x that's negative 14 x squared and then we have 2x times 4 with the negative sign in front so that's negative 8x divided by this so now let's combine like terms 7x squared minus 14x squared that's negative 7 x squared and then we have negative 8x plus 35 divided by x squared plus 5 squared and so this is the answer to the problem so that's how you can use the quotient rule to find the derivative of common expressions in the form of a fraction let's try a similar example go ahead and find the derivative of x squared divided by x minus five so feel free to take a minute pause the video and give this problem a shot so let's identify f and g so f is going to be the numerator of the fraction which is x squared and g is going to be the denominator x minus 5. so f prime the derivative of x squared that's going to be 2x and then g prime the derivative of x which is 1 and the derivative of negative 5 is 0. so g prime is 1. now i'm going to rewrite the formula so the derivative of f over g is going to be g f prime minus f of g prime over g squared now let's go ahead and apply it so g in this example is x minus five f prime that's 2x and then minus f is still x squared and then g prime that's 1 divided by g squared or x minus 5 squared so now let's simplify let's distribute 2x to x minus 5. so x times 2x is 2x squared negative 5 times 2x is negative 10x and then we have negative x squared two x squared minus x squared is one x squared so the final answer is x squared minus ten x divided by x minus five squared you could leave your answer like this if you want to or you could also take out the gcf in the numerator which is x so you could write your answer like this x times x minus 10 divided by x minus 5 squared if you want to factor it completely so both answers are acceptable let's try another example so let's say if we have sine x divided by x use the quotient rule to find the derivative of that expression so let's write the formula first so we know it's going to be g f prime minus f g prime over g squared this helps you to prevent making mistakes now let's define what f and g are f is going to be sine x and g is x f prime what is the derivative of sine x the derivative of sine is cosine as for g prime the derivative of x is one so now let's use the formula so it's going to be g which is x times f prime so that's cosine x minus f which is sine x and g prime is one divided by g squared or x squared now for this problem that's basically it there's not much we can do in terms of simplification so the final answer is simply x cosine x minus sine x all divided by x squared and so that's it for this problem the derivative of tangent x is equal to secant squared go ahead and use the quotient rule to prove that the derivative of tangent is secant squared now tangent is sine divided by cosine so we have a fraction so f in this example is sine x g is cosine now f prime the derivative of sine that's cosine and what's the derivative of cosine x the derivative of cosine is negative sine so using the formula the derivative of f over g as always is going to be g f prime minus f g prime over g squared so g is cosine x f prime is also cosine x minus f which is sine x times g prime and that's negative sine x now g squared that's going to be cosine squared now let's see what we can do to simplify this expression cosine x times cosine x is cosine squared x negative sine x times another negative sine x that's going to be positive sine squared this is all divided by cosine squared which we can write like that if we want to now what is cosine squared plus sine squared that's another trigonometric identity cosine squared plus sine squared is equal to one and one over cosine is secant so one divided by cosine squared is secant squared and that's how you can show that the derivative of tangent is secant squared you can do so by using the quotient rule but you got to convert it from tangent to sine over cosine the derivative of secant x is secant tangent x go ahead and use the quotient rule to prove this statement now secant is one over cosine so how can we show that the derivative of one over cosine is secant tangent well let's define f and g so f is going to be the numerator f is one g is going to be cosine x f prime the derivative of one is zero and the derivative of cosine is negative sine so using the formula it's going to be g f prime minus f of g prime over g squared so g is cosine x and then f prime is zero minus f which is one times g prime that's negative sine x all divided by g squared or cosine x squared cosine times zero is zero so that's going to disappear and we're gonna have negative one times negative sine x which is positive sine x all divided by cosine squared now i'm going to rewrite this as 1 over cosine x times sine over cosine so these expressions are the same because one times sine is still sine and cosine times cosine is still cosine squared now the reason why it's separated this way is because one over cosine will give me secant x and sine over cosine is tangent x so that's how you can show that the derivative of secant is secant tangent using the quotient rule
