Transcript for: How To Find The Limit of a Composite Function - Calculus
in this lesson we're going to talk about how to find the limit of a composite function so for the first example we have the inner function X over 3 and the outer function PSI so we're going to evaluate this limit and for this problem we could use direct substitution so we can write sine and we could put the limit on the inside the limit as X approaches pi of the expression X over 3. using direct substitution we could replace x with pi so this becomes sine I over 3. now Pi is equal to 180 degrees if you divide that by 3 that becomes 60. so this is equivalent to sine of 60 degrees which is equal to the square root of 3 over 2. so that's all we need to do for the first example now for the next example we have another composite function and so what we can do is write it like this we have the natural log of the limit as X approaches zero of cosine of x now cosine of zero we know it's 1. and as you approach Zero from the right side or zero from the left side it will still be one cosine of positive point zero one is approximately positive one and cosine of negative point zero one if you type in your calculator that's still approximately positive one so using direct substitution we get that cosine of zero is one and we know the natural log of one is zero now let's work on another example let's say we have the limit as X approach is zero but it's going to be from the right side and this is going to be of the natural log of x cosine gets now this one is going to be a little bit more trickier than the last one but still doable so feel free to pause the video and try this example now for this problem what I'd like to do is set y equal to the inner function so I'm going to make y equal to x cosine X now in order to evaluate the limit as X approaches 0 from the right of the inside function it's helpful to know what these values are independent of each other so the limit as X approaches 0 of X that's going to be zero so specifically zero to the right and the limit as X approaches Zero from the right of cosine that's going to be 1. so sine of 0 is 1. now if we put these two together zero to the right times one we get x cosine X well this is going to be zero so specifically zero to the right meaning it's going to approach zero from the right side so it's going to be approximately it's going to be above zero but getting closer to zero so it's not going to be less than zero it's going to be above it if it was less than zero it would be approaching Zero from the left we don't have that so what I'm going to do is I'm going to say this we have the limit as well of Ln I'm going to replace this with y now as X approaches 0 from the right x cosine X which is y and that is going to approach a zero from the right so what I'm going to have here is as y approaches 0 from the right because that's what we have here as X approaches 0 from the right we get that y approaches 0 from the right so now we have to apply that to the outer function Ln now we know that Ln 1 is equal to zero and Ln 0 does not exist it's like undefined but what about Ln as we approach Zero from the right as we approach 0 from the right this is going to be negative Infinity if you have your calculator with you if you were to type in Ln of a small number but just above zero or to the right of zero so Ln point zero one this will give you negative 4.6 now if we were to type in Ln 1 times 10 to the negative 30 . so that's still above zero but very close to zero you would get Negative 69. so as you can see as you get closer and closer to zero it's becoming more negative so this is going to be the final answer it's a negative Infinity now let's work on another example what is the limit as X approaches pi over 2. of this composite function e raised to the tangent X feel free to try that one so for this problem I'm going to make y equal the tangent now notice that this is not from the right or from the left side and for this one for tangent it matters because tangent 90 it's undefined and the left side and the right side they have different values if we were to take the limit as X approaches pi over 2 which is 90 degrees from the right side we would get a different value and this is for tangent X we would get a different value compared to if we were to take the limit as X approaches pi over 2 from the left side and to confirm this if you were to type in tan 90 in your calculator it will be undefined foreign if you were to plug in 1091 you would get Negative 57.2 91 is in quadrant two and tangent is negative in quadrant two but if we were to plug in 10 89 degrees you would get positive so these 7.2 because it's positive in quadrant one if we were to create a number line 91 would be equivalent to PI over 2 approaching from the right side 89 will be equivalent to PI over 2 but approach to the left so the limit as X approaches pi over 2 from the right side AKA 1091 that's going to give us negative Infinity and the limit as X approaches pi over 2 from the left side of tangent X AKA tan 89 that's going to give us positive Infinity so that's what we want to understand from this so what we're going to have is the limit as y approaches we're gonna have to figure out what goes here and I'm going to replace tangent with y so the limit as X approaches pi over 2 for tangent accurate notice that it's different so what this means is I'm going to have to break this problem into two parts so let's start with this one let's see what it is as we approach from the right this is going to be e to the Y so as X approaches pi over 2 from the right tangent X will become negative Infinity so in other words y approaches negative Infinity since Y is defined to be tangent X now what is the limit as y approaches negative infinity or e to the Y so this is going to be e to the negative Infinity which is the same as 1 over e to the infinity e to the infinity is infinity and one over infinity is zero whenever you divide a constant by a very large number you're going to get a smaller number so this is going to go to zero so that's the value for the right sided limit now let's check the value for the left-sided limit so we can get rid of this so the limit as X approaches pi over 2 from the left of e tangent X says X approaches pi over 2 from the left tangent is going to go to positive Infinity so we could say that we have the limit as y goes to positive Infinity of e and we'll replace tangent with y so this becomes e to the infinity which is infinity now notice that the right sided limit and the left side limit as two different values they're not the same because they don't equal to each other because they're not equal to each other the limit does not exist so this is going to be the answer so sometimes you have to be careful when you don't have a one-sided limit you need to track to see if the right side limit and the left side limit if they lead to the same value so that's basically it for this video by the way
