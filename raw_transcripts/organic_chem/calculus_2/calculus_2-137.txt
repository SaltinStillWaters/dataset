Transcript for: First Derivative Test
in this video we're going to talk about how to use the first derivative test to determine the relative extrema of a function so here is a relative minimum and this is a relative maximum and this graph has no relative minimum or maximum so let's talk about these graphs now for the first one on the upper left corner notice that of the left side of the minimum the function is decreasing so it's decreasing when the first derivative is negative and here the function is increasing it's increasing when the first derivative is positive so according to the first derivative test if the sign of the first derivative changes from negative to positive then you have a minimum in order to have a maximum the function has to be increasing first and then decreasing later so then the first derivative has to change from positive to negative now for the other two graphs the sign will not change notice that the function is increasing and then it stops the slope is zero at this point and then it increases again so notice that the sign doesn't change and for the second one it's always decreasing so therefore the sign doesn't change either so if the sign of the first derivative does not change there is no relative maximum or relative minimum but if it changes from negative to positive then according to the first derivative test a minimum exists or if it changes from positive to negative then there's a local maximum or a relative maximum now let's work on some practice problems consider the function f of x is equal to x squared minus four x plus five so go ahead and use the first derivative test to determine the relative extrema of this function so the first thing we need to do is find the first derivative the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of 4x is 4 and for a constant is 0. once you have the first derivative set it equal to 0 i'm going to factor out 2 and so i could see that my critical number is x equals 2. if you set the factor x minus 2 equal to 0 then x is equal to 2. now once you have the critical number make a sign chart so draw a number line and put the critical number on it and then plug in some test points so to the right of two let's say at three if we plug it into the first derivative will give us a positive number or a negative number three minus two is positive now if we plug in a number less than one i mean less than two like one let's see what's going to happen one minus two is negative so that will give us a negative result so notice that the first derivative it changes from negative to positive so on the left side the function is decreasing and on the right side is increasing and so this correlates to a relative minimum so we have a relative minimum at x equals two now to find the relative minimum value you could plug it back into the function and get the y coordinate so f of two is equal to two squared minus four times two plus five two squared is four four times two is eight four minus eight is negative four plus five that's one so as an ordered pair x is two y is one so these are the coordinates of the relative minimum so the relative minimum is located at x equals two but it has a value of one now let's try this one let's say that f of x is equal to x cubed minus 12x go ahead and use the first derivative test to determine all of the relative extrema in this function so we're going to follow the same process we're going to find the first derivative set it equal to zero and get the critical points so the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and the derivative of 12x is 12. now let's take out the gcf which is 3. 3x squared divided by 3 is x squared negative 12 divided by 3 is negative 4. and so we could factor x squared minus four using the difference of squares technique so the square root of x squared is x the square root of four is two one is going to be positive and the other will be negative so we have two critical numbers positive two and negative two so now let's create a sign chart and let's put the critical numbers in ascendant order so let's pick a number that's greater than two let's try three three plus two is positive three minus two is positive if you multiply two positive numbers it will give you a positive result now if we pick a number that's between negative two and two let's try zero for example zero plus two is positive and zero minus two is negative a positive number times a negative number that will give you a negative number and then if we pick a number that's less than negative two like negative three negative three plus two that's negative one so that's negative negative three minus two is another negative number if you multiply two negative numbers you'll get a positive number now let's get rid of some stuff so which of these two critical points is the relative maximum and which one is the relative minimum so let's consider negative two the function is increasing and then it decreases so that is a maximum and for positive two it's a decrease and it's negative first and then it's increasing it's positive later that is a minimum and that's a quick and simple way to determine the relative extrema of the function so now let's get the y coordinates so let's start with f of positive two two to the third that's two times two times two that's eight and twelve times two is twenty four so 8 minus 24 is negative 16 which is a relatively low number so that can correspond to the minimum now let's try f of negative 2 so it's a negative 2 to the third minus 12 times negative 2. negative 2 times negative 2 times negative 2 that's negative 8 negative 12 times negative 2 is positive 24 so this gives us positive 16. so the maximum is located at x equals negative 2 but it has a value of 16 and the minimum is positive 2 negative 16. so we can see that the minimum has a much lower value than the maximum and so that's it for this particular example that's how you can use the first derivative test to determine the relative extrema of this function let's work on one more example given the function 3x to the fourth minus 8x cubed plus 6x squared find the relative extrema of this function so just like before let's start with the first derivative the derivative of x to the fourth is 4x cubed and the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared and for x squared the derivative of that is two x so three times four is twelve eight times three is twenty four and six times two is twelve so let's set it equal to zero and let's begin by taking out the gcf the greatest common factor is 12x so 12x cubed divided by 12x is x squared negative 24x squared divided by 12x is negative 2x and then 12x divided by itself is one so how can we factor this trinomial so we need to find two numbers that multiply to one but add up to negative two and so that's going to be negative one and negative one so this is gonna be x minus 1 times x minus 1. so the first derivative is going to be 12x times x minus 1 squared so i'm just going to rewrite that up here so let's set each factor equal to zero so if we set 12x equal to zero the first critical number is x is zero and if we set x minus one squared equal to zero we can clearly see that when x is one the whole thing will equal zero so we have two critical numbers zero and one in this example now let's make a sign chart and let's put the critical numbers in ascendant order so the critical numbers are zero and one now let's pick a number that's greater than one let's try two so twelve times two that's a positive number and two minus 1 squared is going to be positive now what do you think the next one is going to be what sign should we put here so we're traveling across this particular critical number and notice that the multiplicity is even if the multiplicity is even it will not change sign but for this one the multiplicity is odd so it's going to change the sign across the zero which means this is going to be negative if you plug in let's say 0.5 12 times 0.5 is positive 0.5 minus 1 is a negative once you square it it's positive if you multiply 2 positive numbers you'll get a positive result but let's say if you plug in negative 1 negative 1 minus 1 is negative but squared is positive 12 times negative 1 is negative a negative times a positive will give us the negative result and so you could use the multiplicities to figure out the rest if you know the first sign so you don't have to use three test points only one now looking at this particular critical number it changes from negative to positive so we have a minimum at zero and at one it's increasing and then it increases again so we don't have a minimum or maximum at one so we just have a minimum at zero and to find the y value if we plug in zero into this there's no constants everything contains an x so y would also be zero so the minimum is located at the origin it's zero comma zero for this particular example and so that's it for this video now you know how to use the first derivative test to determine the relative extrema of a function you
