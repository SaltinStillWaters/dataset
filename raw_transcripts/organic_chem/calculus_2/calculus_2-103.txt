Transcript for: Related Rate Problems - The Cube - Volume, Surface Area & Diagonal Length
the edges of a cube are increasing at a rate of 10 meters per hour how fast is the volume of the cube changing when the side lamps are 5 meters well let's draw a picture first i know my drawings are not that great but bear with me for one moment so we have this cube and the side length of the cube are all the same let's call it x now let's make a list of what we know in this problem the edges of the cube that is x they're increasing at a rate of 10 meters per hour so dx dt is 10 meters per hour how fast is the volume of the cube changing so we're looking for dv dt when the side lengths are five so when x is five meters so how can we calculate dv dt first we need to write an equation that relates the volume of the cube to x now the volume of a rectangular prism is the length times the width times the height in this case the length of the cube is x the width is x and the height is x so x times x times x or one plus one plus one is three so the volume is x cubed so now that we've related v to x we could differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time so the derivative of v is going to be 1 times dv dt and the derivative of x cubed using the power rule is 3x squared times dx dt so that's the formula that we need to use right now but let's get rid of some stuff so we can see that x is 5 and dx dt is 10 meters per hour now let's do the math 5 squared is 25 and 3 times 25 is 75 and 75 times 10 is 750. so dv dt is equal to 750. now what are the units for dv dt so notice that we have meters squared times meters per hour meters squared times meters that's going to be cubic meters so it's cubic meters per hour and since the edges of the cube are increasing dv dt is increasing so it's equal to a positive number and that's it for part a of this problem so that's how you can calculate the rate at which the volume of a cube is changing now let's move on to part b how fast is the surface area of the cube changing when the edge lamps are eight so x is no longer five but it's eight meters so let's change that number so how can we find the answer to this question how can we determine the rate at which the surface area is changing how can we find ds80t so first we need to come up with an equation that relates the surface area of a cube to x the surface area is going to be the area of all six sides so notice that we have a side in the front one in the back so that's two sides here's the one on the left and here's the one on the right so that's four sides and then we have the bottom face of the cube and the top face of the cube so there's six faces now the area of each face the area of a square is the length times the width or simply x squared so the surface area of the q because there's six faces all of which are going to be the same it's going to be 6 times x squared because you have to add up the area of each face each of which is x squared now let's find the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to t so the derivative of s a is going to be 1 times d s a dt and then for the right side we need to rewrite the constant based on the constant multiple rule and then differentiate x squared based on the power rule which is going to be 2x to the first power times dx dt so 6 times 2 is 12 and then we can replace x with 8. well let's put 8 meters so we can pay attention to the units and then dx dt that's 10 meters per hour so what's 12 times 8 10 times 8 is 80 2 times 8 is 16 so 80 plus 16 is 96 and so 12 times 8 is 96 and then 96 times 10 is 960. so dsa dt is going to be 960. now what are the units so we have meters times meters which is going to be square meters and for dt it's going to be in hours and it makes sense because the volume is usually in cubic meters area is going to be in square meters which we do have here so that's the value of ds80t it's 960 square meters per hour so that's it for part b now let's move on to part c how fast is the length of the diagonal in the cube changing when the edge lengths are 12. so let's replace this number with 12 meters so first let's draw the diagonal that we're focused on so it's the distance between these two points and i'm going to draw it in basically a red color so let's call it z diagonal z so we're looking for how fast z is changing so we need to calculate dz dt now how can we come up with an equation that relates the diagonal z to x now first we need to draw another diagonal which is going to be at the bottom face of the cube let's call that diagonal l notice that it forms a right triangle so if you want to redraw it looks like this so this is x x l what is the relationship between x and l well according to the pythagorean theorem which is uh c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared c being the hypotenuse l is the hypotenuse in this example and a and b are x so l squared is basically x squared plus x squared now let's focus on another triangle which i'm going to highlight in blue and that is this triangle here notice that it forms another right triangle so i'm going to redraw it and for that triangle we have l at the bottom x and z this time z is the hypotenuse so this is z squared is equal to x squared plus l squared and now we can replace l squared with x squared plus x squared so therefore z squared is going to be x squared plus x squared plus x squared so 1 plus 1 plus 1 is 3 so z squared is equal to 3 times x squared and so this is the equation that we need to relate z and x now let's go ahead and find the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to t so the derivative of z squared is going to be 2z times dz dt and the derivative of 3x squared is going to be 3 times 2x times dx dt so now we can calculate dz dt but first let's divide both sides by 2 just to get rid of that too now we need to find z as well because we don't have that so let's use this equation to get z so we know that z squared is equal to three times x squared and in this example x is 12. so i recommend taking the square root of both sides at this point so z is going to be the square root of 3 times the square root of 12 squared the square root of 12 squared is the square root of 144 which is 12. so z is basically 12 times the square root of 3 which i'm going to write over here now let's plug in everything so this is z 12 square root 3 we need to solve for dz dt and then we have 3 times x where x is 12 and then dx dt that's still 10. so if we divide both sides by 12 we can get rid of this and then on the right side we have 3 times 10 which is 30. so the square root of 3 times dz dt that's equal to 30. now let's divide by the square root of three so dz dt is equal to 30 divided by the square root of three and then we need to rationalize the fraction so let's multiply the top and the bottom by the square root of three the square root of three times the square root of three is the square root of nine which is three and thirty divided by 3 is 10. so dz dt is 10 square root 3 and the units will be the same as dx of t so it's going to be meters per hour because x is a unit of length just as z is a unit of left so that's the final answer for d dt you
