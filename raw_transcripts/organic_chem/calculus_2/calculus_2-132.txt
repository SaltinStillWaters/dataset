Transcript for: Finding Absolute Maximum and Minimum Values - Absolute Extrema
in this lesson we're going to focus on identifying the location of the absolute maximums and minimums of a function so let's start with a graph so you can visually see it and let's say if we have a function that looks like this so let's call this point a point B C and D identify the location of any absolute and relative extrema of this particular graph so the absolute maximum is the highest point on a graph and the absolute minimum is the lowest point now this peak right here it's not the highest point but it's the highest point in this local area so it's called a local Max or a relative maximum and this point is a relative or a local minimum now to identify the location of the absolute extrema you simply have to compare the Y values so you may need to make a data table to do so to identify the relative extrema you need to identify the locations where the slope is 0 since we have a horizontal tangent line f prime of B will be equal to 0 and F prime of C will also be equal to 0 so you need to use the first derivative to find the location of any relative extrema now let's work on a practice problem so let's say that f of X is equal to x squared minus 4x plus 9 and identify any absolute and relative extreme values of the function anywhere in the interval between 1 and 4 so the first thing I would recommend doing is identifying the critical points that's where the first derivative is equal to 0 at those locations you could find any relative extrema values like a relative min or max the derivative of x squared is 2x the derivative of negative 4x is negative 4 and the derivative of a constant is 0 so let's set this equal to 0 now let's take out a 2 so this is going to be X minus 2 if we divide both sides by 2 and 0 is equal to X minus 2 and if we add 2x is equal to 2 so we have 2 as the critical number and we need to identify if this is going to be a relative maximum or a relative minimum so we need to create a sign chart so let's make a number line now we need to determine what the slope is going to be to the left and to the right of 2 so let's pick a number that's greater than 2 let's try 3 if we plug in 3 into the first derivative 3 minus 2 is positive so the result will be positive if we plug in a number that's less than 2 like 1 into the first derivative 1 minus 2 will be negative and then if we multiply that by 2 that will give you a negative result so notice that the slope changes from negative to positive across the critical point so a to do we have a relative and Maxima or a relative minimum when a slope is negative the function is decreasing and when it's positive the function is increasing and so this is a minimum so we have a relative minimum at x equals 2 so now let's move on to the absolute extreme values so once you have all of the critical points make a table now on the table you want to put the endpoints of the interval so run in 4 and then in between that any critical numbers that you have now we need to determine the Y values for each of these x-values so we need to plug in the values into this function to get one so let's start with one F of one is going to be 1 squared minus 4 times 1 plus 9 so this is 1 minus 4 plus 9 1 plus 9 is 10 10 minus 4 is 6 so f of 1 is equal to 6 now let's evaluate the function when X is 2 so this is 2 squared minus 4 times 2 plus 9 2 squared is 4 4 times 2 is 8 4 minus 8 is negative 4 negative 4 plus 9 is 5 now let's evaluate the function when X is 4 4 squared is 16 4 times 4 is the same thing 16 minus 16 is 0 0 plus 9 is 9 so f of 4 is equal to 9 so notice that 9 is the highest Y value therefore 9 is the absolute maximum value of the function 5 is the absolute minimum value because 5 is less than 6 and 9 in addition it's also the relative minimum so it's both the absolute minimum and the relative minimum on the interval of 1 to 4 and so that's how you could find the absolute extreme values of the function as well as the relative extreme values now let's work on another problem so let's use a different function so f of X will be equal to let's say 4 X cubed minus 30 9 x squared plus 90 X +2 so identify all of the absolute and relative extreme values of the function on the interval 1 to 6 so feel free to pause the video if you want to try this problem so let's begin by finding the critical numbers of the function so we need to find the first derivative in order to do that the derivative of X cube is 3x squared and the derivative of x squared is 2x the derivative of X is 1 and the derivative of a constant is 0 so f prime of X is going to equal 4 times 3 which is 12 so that's 12x squared 39 times 2 is 78 and then plus 90 so let's set the first derivative equal to 0 now notice that all of the coefficients are even so we can divide everything by 2 if we do so if we divide both sides by 2 on the left 0 divided by 2 is 0 on the right half of 12 is 6 half of 78 is 39 and half of 90 is 45 now 639 and 45 they are divisible by 3 so let's divide everything by 3 so this is going to be 0 and then 6 divided by 3 is 2 39 divided by 3 is 13 45 divided by 3 is 15 so now let's factor the expression that we have by the way if you want the first derivative in its factored form we divided everything by 6 so you can write it like this if you want to so how can we factor 2x squared minus 13x plus 15 how can we do that so first we need to multiply the leading coefficient by the constant term you need to do that anytime this number is anything but 1/2 times 15 is 30 now we need to find two numbers that multiply to 30 but add to the middle coefficient of negative 13 so this is going to be 10 and 3 both of which are negative because negative 10 times negative 3 is positive 30 but negative 10 plus negative 3 adds up to negative 13 so what we're going to do is replace the middle term negative 13x with negative 10x minus 3x and then we need to factor by grouping so take out the GCF in the first two terms the greatest common factor is 2x 2x squared divided by 2x is X negative 10x divided by 2x is negative 5 in the last two terms take out the greatest common factor which is going to be negative 3 negative 3x divided by negative 3 is X positive 15 divided by negative 3 and it's negative 5 so now we need to factor out X minus 5 so this term divided by X minus five these two will cancel leaving behind 2x and if we take this term divided by X minus five these will cancel giving us negative three so this is the first derivative in its factored form now we need to set each factor equal to zero so FLE set X minus 5 equal to zero and add 5 to both sides this is the first critical number X is equal to 5 and then let's set the other factor to X minus 3 equal to 0 so add 3 to both sides and then divide by 2 so the second critical point is 3 over 2 so now we need to make a sign chart to determine which of those critical points represent the relative maximum and which one is the relative minimum 3 over 2 comes before 5 so let's pick a number that's greater than 5 and then you should rewrite this expression so let's try 6 if we plug in 6 we'll the first derivative be positive or negative 6 minus 5 is positive 2 times 6 minus 3 is also positive so if we multiply two positive numbers this will give us a positive result now notice that for each factor we have an odd exponent that means the signs will change across each critical number so if you pick a number between one point five and five it's going to be negative so let's try 2 2 times 2 minus 3 that's positive that's equal to positive 1 2 minus 5 is negative a negative number times a positive number will give us a negative ezel and if we pick something that's a less than 2 we have a 2 like zero that will be positive zero minus 5 is negative two times zero minus 3 is also negative if you multiply two negative numbers that will give you a positive result now which of these critical numbers represents a maximum and which one is a minimum well let's focus on 3 over 2 the function is increasing and then it's decreasing so that represents a maximum and for five its decrease in first and then is increasing so that's a minimum so now let's make a table so let's put the endpoints so we have one and six and make sure that the critical numbers are in this interval if they're not you can't use them so 3 over 2 is 1 point 5 that's between 1 and 6 and so it's 5 now let's identify the y-values for each of the X values so let's start with one this is going to be 4 minus 39 plus 90 plus 2 and I'm going to use the calculator for this one so I got 57 when X is 1 now when X is 3 over 2 or 1.5 this is going to be 4 times 1.5 to the third power minus 39 times 1.5 squared + 90 times 1.5 plus 2 so hopefully you're allowed to use calculators on a test because this will take a while we could do it without a calculator but I'm not gonna do it in this video so I got as the decimal 60 2.75 now for F of five I'm just going to type it in I got negative 23 and then for F of 6 I got two now which of these points represent the absolute maximum in this interval sixty two point seven five is the highest value so this is the absolute maximum what about the absolute minimum negative twenty three is the lowest Y value listed so five comma negative twenty-three that's the absolute minimum so the absolute minimum of the function is located at x equals five but the absolute minimum value that represents the y-coordinate the value is negative twenty three so typically the location is associated with the x coordinate but the value is associated with the y coordinate now we said that three over two was also the relative maximum it was a critical number and five was a relative minimum so sometimes the endpoints they may be an absolute Max or an absolute minimum you don't know you have to check it other times the absolute max can be the relative Max and the absolute minimum can be the relative minimum so you need to make the table make sure you put the endpoints of the closed interval and their critical points in the table and then just compare the y-values so that's it for this video
