in this video we're going to work on some related rates problems associated with distance let's start with this one a particle moves along the curve y equals x squared plus 2. the x-coordinate increases at a rate of 4 centimeters per second how fast is the distance between a point and the origin changing when x is two so let's start with a picture let's graph the function so x squared is basically a parabola and it's been shifted up two units so it looks like this that's a generic shape let me draw in red now let's say at this point x is equal to one let's call that point p and here is the origin so we need to find out how fast the distance between the origin and point p is changing so let's make a right triangle so this is going to be x y and the distance between point p and the origin let's call it z so we need to determine how fast z is changing so our goal in this problem is to calculate dz dt now let's make a list of what we know so we know that x is equal to one we don't know the value of y and we currently do not know the value of z now all of these are variables x y and z change none of them are fixed or constants now we have dx dt that's the rate at which the x coordinate is changing and that's four centimeters per second we don't have dy dt nor do we have dz dt but dz dt is what we're looking for that's the goal of this problem so let's put a question mark here so how can we calculate dz dt what do we need to do in this problem well let's find out the missing pieces first let's start with why how can we calculate y now we're given this equation y is equal to x squared plus two and we have x so let's replace x with one one squared is one and one plus two is three so y is equal to three now using that same equation we can calculate d y dt so let's differentiate this function with respect to time the derivative of y is going to be 1 times d y dt the derivative of x squared is going to be 2x times dx dt and 2 is a constant the derivative of a constant will be 0. so x is one dx dt is four two times four is eight so dydt is eight so now we need to calculate z and dz dt so we have this right triangle that we can use so based on the pythagorean theorem we know that c squared is equal to a squared plus a b squared and the hypotenuse is z so z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared first let's use this formula to calculate z so x is one y is three so one squared plus three squared that's one plus nine which is ten so z squared is equal to 10. if z squared is 10 then all we need to do is take the square root of both sides to calculate z so z is equal to the square root of 10. so now that we have z we could determine dz dt so let's start with this equation and let's differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time the derivative of z squared is 2z times dz dt and the derivative of x squared is going to be 2x dx dt and for y squared it's going to be 2y dy dt now let's divide everything by 2 so we can get rid of these and then plug everything in and solve for dz dt so z is the square root of 10 dz dt is what we're looking for x in this problem is one dx dt is four y is three d y dt is eight so 3 times 8 is 24 and 4 plus 24 is 28 so now we need to divide both sides by the square root of 10. so dz dt is equal to 28 divided by the square root of 10. now let's go ahead and rationalize this problem so let's multiply the top and the bottom by the square root of 10. so this is going to be 28 square root 10 divided by 10. now let's divide the top and the bottom by 2. half of 28 is 14 half of 10 is 5. so dz dt is 14 square root 10 over 5 and the unit will be the same as c x dt which is centimeters per second so that's the rate at which the distance between the point and the origin is changing when x is equal to one number two two cars begin moving from the same starting point at noon one travels east at 60 miles per hour and the other travels north at 80 miles per hour how fast is the distance between the two cars changing at three o'clock so let's draw a picture so the first car let's say this is the starting point travels east the second car travels north and the distance between them at some time later is going to be represented by that mark or that line so let's say x is the distance that the first car travels east y is the distance that the second car travels north and the distance between the two cars at three o'clock let's call that z now we have the rate at which x is changing the first car is traveling east at 60 miles per hour so that's dx dt now the second car is traveling north at 80 miles per hour so that's dy dc we need to find out how fast the z is changing the distance between the two cars so our goal is to calculate dz dt now what is x and what is y and z as well now the cars they begin traveling at noon that's at 12 o'clock and the current time is 3 o'clock so that means that 3 hours has passed so if the first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour how many miles did it travel in three hours so every hour it's doing 60 miles so in three hours it's going to do 60 times 3 or 180 miles now for the second car it's going at 80 miles every hour so in three hours eighty times three it's going to do 240 miles in distance now that we have x and y we can easily calculate z using the pythagorean theorem z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared now x is 180 and y is 240. so let's get a calculator for this square that's 32 400 and 240 squared is 57 600 so if we add those two numbers this will give us ninety thousand and that's equal to z squared so what is the square root of ninety thousand can we do that without a calculator ninety thousand is basically nine times ten thousand and the square root of nine is three the square root of ten thousand is a hundred so z is going to be three hundred so now that we have z we can calculate dz dt so it's going to be 2z well first we need to differentiate both sides with respect to time if we do so we're going to get 2z dz dt and that's equal to 2x dx dt plus 2y dy dt so dividing everything by two we're gonna have this equation left over so z is 300 we need to calculate dz dt x is 180 times dx dt which is 60 y is 240 times dy dt which is 80. so 180 times 60 that's 10 hundred and then two forty times eighty that's nineteen thousand two hundred and once again i am running out of space so now we have 300 times dz dt and if we add 19 200 plus thousand eight hundred that's equal to thirty thousand so now let's divide both sides by three hundred so we could cancel two zeros and three divided by three is one so we're going to have a one with two zeros left over so dz dt is a hundred and it has the same units as dxct and dydt which is miles per hour now it turns out that there's a simpler way in which you can get the same answer without drawing any pictures and just as z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared for this particular type of problem it turns out that dz over dt squared is equal to dx over dt squared plus dy over dt squared so dx dt that's 60 so we have 60 squared dy dt is 80 and 60 squared 60 times 60 that is 3600 and 80 squared is 6400 i put 64 000. 3600 plus 6400 is 10 000. so that's equal to dz dt squared which means we need to take the square root of both sides and we know the square root of ten thousand is a hundred so that's another way a much simpler way in which you can get the same answer to z to t number three at 2 pm ship b is 160 kilometers east of ship a so let's draw a picture so these are the two ships and b is east of a so b is to the right of a and the distance between these two points is 160 kilometers so this is the situation at 2pm now ship a is sailing south at 12 kilometers per hour ship b is selling north at 18 kilometers per hour how fast is the distance between the two ships changing at six pm so that is four hours later so what is the situation at four hours later or at six pm so the horizontal distance will still be the same now b has moved 18 kilometers per hour times four because the difference between 2 pm and 6 pm is 4 hours so 18 times 4 is 72 so b has traveled 72 kilometers north and a has traveled let's see 12 kilometers per hour so for four hours that's going to be 48 kilometers and then if we add 72 and 48 that's 120 so we can redraw this picture like this so the horizontal distance is still 160 but the vertical distance is now 120 and that is not drawn to scale so this is x and this is y now z is the distance between ships a and b so b is over here at this instant and this is a so our goal is to calculate dz dt now what's dx dt and what is d y dt notice that x does not change at two o'clock x was 160 and at six o'clock x is still 160. so therefore dx dt is zero the change in x with respect to time is zero now what about d y dt how can we determine d y dt so this is the rate at which y is changing with respect to time so notice that at 2 pm y is 0 because a and b they were horizontally apart from each other there was no vertical distance between a and b they're at the same horizontal line so y is zero at 6 p.m y is now 120 so the change in y is 120 minus zero and that's kilometers so i changed 120 kilometers in four hours so if we divide 120 by 4 we can see that dy dt is 30 kilometers per hour another way in which you can determine that same answer is to add up 12 and 18 because both of these values they act in such a way to increase the y value so 12 plus 18 will give you 30. now let's organize the data so we have a right triangle this is x y and z and then here is ship a and this is ship b so we said that x is 160 kilometers y is 120 kilometers and we don't currently have the value for z now dx dt since x doesn't change dx dt is zero dy dt is 12 plus 18 so it's 30 kilometers per hour and the goal in this problem is to calculate dz dt so let's begin so first we know that z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared x is 160 and y is 120. 160 square that's 25 600 and 120 squared is 14 400. so adding up these two numbers and this is equal to forty thousand so that's z squared the square root of forty thousand is two hundred so now we have z so at this point what we can do is differentiate both sides with respect to time so the derivative of z squared is 2z times dz dt the derivative of x squared is zero because x is a constant and for y squared is going to be two y d y dt dividing both sides by two we have z dz dt is equal to y d y dt so z is 200 and y is 120 d y dt is 30. so let's divide both sides by 200. so the z dt is going to be 120 times 30 divided by 200 which is 18. so the zdt is 18 kilometers per hour that's how fast it's changing you
