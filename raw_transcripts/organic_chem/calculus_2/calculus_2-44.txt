Transcript for: Limits at Infinity With Radicals & Fractional Exponents
consider this problem what is the limit as x goes to infinity of the x root of x feel free to try this problem so what would you recommend is our first step here what's the first thing we need to do in order to solve this problem what i recommend doing is setting the original expression equal to y so we have y is equal to the limit as x goes to infinity of x root of x now the next thing that we could do is change the radical into a fractional exponent this is x to the first power and so we can write this as this is equal to the limit as x goes to infinity of x raised to the 1 over x so now what do you think we should do whenever you have a variable raised to another variable in order to bring this exponent down you need to use logarithms we're going to use the natural log so let's take the natural log of both sides so we're going to have the natural log of y is equal to the limit as x goes to infinity of the natural log of x raised to the 1 over x and for instance ln x to the fourth power is equal to 4 times ln x that's just one of the properties of logs you could take the exponent and move it to the front so we're going to do the same thing here we're going to take 1 over x and move it to the front and so we're going to have ln y is equal to the limit as x goes to infinity 1 over x times ln x and we can write that as the natural log of x divided by x now if we were to use direct substitution at this point we would get the natural log of infinity over infinity which is infinity divided by infinity and infinity divided by infinity you really don't know what that is that could be infinity it could be zero it could be five it's indeterminate so whenever you have an indeterminate type like this one or zero over zero you can evaluate the limit using l'hopital's rule which is what we're going to do since direct substitution didn't work at this point and in order to use lobital's rule we need to take the derivative of the top and the bottom part of the fraction so we have ln y is equal to the limit as x goes to infinity and the derivative of ln x is one over x the derivative of x is one one over x divided by one is just one over x so now at this point we could use direct substitution the limit as x goes to infinity of one over x is zero one divided by a very large number is going to give us a very small number so one of infinity is virtually zero so we have ln y is equal to zero now whenever you have a log expression let's say log base a of b is equal to c you can convert it into an exponential expression a raised to the c power is equal to b now the base of a natural log is always e so we could say e to the zero power is equal to y and anything raised to let me say that again anything raised to the zero power is one so our answer is one so y is equal to our original expression the limit as x goes to infinity of the x root of x all of that is equal to one and so that is our answer now let's confirm the answer with the use of a table so let's say if x is 10 we're going to have the tenth root of 10 or 10 to the 1 over 10. if we plug that into our calculator 10 raised to the 1 over 10 it's going to give us 1.2589 let's see what happens when x gets larger let's try 100 so 100 raised to the 1 over 100 that's going to be 1.04713 so notice how the numbers are getting smaller if we try a thousand this is going to be one point zero zero six nine three and let's try one more ten thousand so ten thousand raised to the one over ten thousand and that's going to be 1.000921 so we can see that as x gets larger and larger that is as it goes to infinity that expression the x root of x approaches one and so that is the answer to this problem
