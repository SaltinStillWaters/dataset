Transcript for: Derivatives of Inverse Hyperbolic Functions
in this video we're going to talk about how to find the derivative of inverse hyperbolic functions so let's go over some formulas that you need to know you may want to write these down the derivative of the inverse hyperbolic sine function of the variable U where U is a function of x it's equal to U Prime over the square root of U squared plus 1. next we have the derivative of the inverse hyperbolic cosine function of U and this is equal to U Prime over the square root of U squared minus 1 as opposed to plus one now moving on to tangent the derivative of the inverse hyperbolic tangent function of U is going to be U Prime over 1 minus U squared there's no square root for that now the derivative for the inverse hyperbolic cosecant function of the variable U is going to be negative U Prime over the absolute value of U times the square root of 1 plus u squared now for secant it's going to be very similar negative U Prime over U times the square root of 1 minus U squared so for some reason it doesn't have the absolute value here as in the case of inverse hyperbolic cosecant and then we have one more the derivative of the inverse hyperbolic cotangent function of U is equal to U Prime over 1 minus U squared which is exactly the same as the inverse hyperbolic tangent function of U now let's work on some practice problems go ahead and find the derivative of this function of the inverse hyperbolic sine function of 4X feel free to work on that problem so what I'm going to do first is I'm going to write the formula the answer is going to be U Prime over the square root of U squared plus 1. now the variable U is whatever we see inside of the inverse function so in this case that's going to be 4X U Prime is the derivative of 4X which is 4. so all we got to do is plug that into that formula and it's going to give us the answer so it's 4 over the square root 4x squared Plus 1. 4x squared that's 4X times 4X which is 16x squared plus 1 and that's it let's try another example so let's find the derivative of hyperbolic cosine the inverse hyperbolic cosine function of X cubed so using the formula it's U Prime over the square root of U squared minus 1. so in this problem U is equal to X cubed U Prime the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared so this is going to equal let's plug it into that formula so it's 3x squared divided by the square root of U squared which is X cubed squared minus 1. so that's going to be 3x squared over the square root of 3 times 2 is 6. so we get x to the 6 minus 1. so that's it for that particular problem now let's move on to our next example let's find the derivative of the inverse hyperbolic tangent function of the square root of x so for hyperbolic tangent the formula is U Prime over 1 minus U squared so U is equal to the square root of x which is if you rewrite it it's x to the one-half U Prime is going to be using the power rule it's going to be one half X one half minus one is negative one-half if we rewrite it it's 1 over 2 square root X so plug in all that into this formula we're going to get U Prime which is 1 over 2 square root X all divided by 1 minus U squared so 1 minus U is the square root of x and then we're going to square it so this simplifies to 1 over 2 square root X over 1 minus the square root of x squared is simply X now what we're going to do is we're going to multiply the top and bottom by 2 square root X so these will cancel giving us our final answer which is 1 over 2 square root x times 1 minus X so that is the derivative of the inverse hyperbolic tangent function of the square root of x now let's try another example go ahead and find the derivative with respect to X of the inverse hyperbolic cosecant function of x but it's going to be raised to the third power go ahead and try that so for this one we need to use the chain rule we need to differentiate this as if it's X cubed or Y cubed so we're going to work on the outside part this is going to be 3 and then we're going to keep everything on the inside the same and then the exponent we're going to subtract it by 1. much as if you differentiate X cubed you get let me say that again if you differentiate X cubed you get 3x squared but now we need to differentiate the inside part cosecant the formula for that where did I put that paper so here's the formula for the inverse hyperbolic cosecant function it's negative U Prime over absolute value of U times the square root of 1 plus u squared in this case U is equal to X U Prime is going to be just one so it's going to be times negative U prime or negative one over the absolute value of x times the square root of 1 plus x squared so putting it all together we can multiply 3 and negative one so it's going to be negative 3 times what we have here inverse hyperbolic cosecant of x and that's going to be raised to the second power all divided by the absolute value of x times the square root of 1 plus x squared so that is the final answer now let's work on one more problem let's say we have this equation Y is equal to 6 times the inverse hyperbolic sine of 3x and then Plus actually let's make this 6x and then minus 2 square root 1 plus 9x squared go ahead and find the derivative of that expression so what we have here for this part is a product rule problem the derivative of FG is going to be the derivative of the first part times the second plus the first part times the derivative of the second part so we're going to apply that for this portion so the derivative of the first part 6X is just 6. we're going to keep the second part the same and then we'll keep the first part the same which is 6x now we're going to differentiate the second part so to do that we need to know the formula for the derivative of inverse sine and we know it to be U Prime over the square root of U squared plus 1. so in this example U is 3x U prime minister 3. so this is going to be times 3 over the square root of U squared which is 3x squared and then plus one now we need to differentiate this expression so it might be good to rewrite it first we could take away the square symbol and replace it with a one-half exponent so using the power rule we're going to move this to the front it's going to be negative 2 times the half we'll keep the inside part the same subtract this by one and then multiply by the derivative of the inside the derivative of one is zero but for nine x squared that's going to be 18x the 2 and the one-half will cancel so this is going to be minus 18x on top now because we have a negative exponent this expression is going to go on the bottom of the fraction now positive a half was a square root on the numerator negative one-half will be a square root in the denominator so this is going to be the square root of 1 plus 9x squared so now let's simplify what we have so here we have 6 times the inverse hyperbolic of sine of 3x 6X times three dots positive 18x 3x squared is 9x squared but we can rewrite it as 1 plus 9x squared and we can just rewrite this so these two are opposites to each other if you add them you get zero therefore the final answer is six inverse hyperbolic sine of 3x so that's it for this lesson now you know how to find the derivative of inverse hyperbolic functions
