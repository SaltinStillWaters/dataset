in this video we're going to talk about how to find the derivative of a few common trigonometric functions that you'll see on a typical homework problem or if you're studying for a test so let's start with this example problem what is the derivative of sine of 2x here's what you could do to find the answer first find the derivative of sine the derivative of sine is cosine now the angle inside of sine will be the same angle of cosine next work your way towards the inside what is the derivative of 2x the derivative of 2x is 2. so you could simply write the final answer as 2 cosine 2x so that's the derivative of sine 2x now let's move on to the next problem what is the derivative of tangent 3x feel free to try that problem and while you're working on that i'm going to write another one find the derivative of cosine 4x so let's start with the first one first we need to find the derivative of tangent the derivative of tangent is secant squared and the angle is going to be the same whatever you see inside here that needs to go in there next we need to find the derivative of the inside function 3x the derivative of 3x is 3 so the answer is going to be 3 secant squared 3x now let's move on to the next example what is the derivative of cosine the derivative of cosine is negative sine we're going to keep the angle the same and then the derivative of 4x is 4. so the final answer is negative 4 sine 4x now let's work on some harder problems let's say we want to find the derivative of sine squared of 2x how can we do so what would you recommend that we do in this problem the first thing that i would recommend doing is rewriting the problem like this this expression is equal to sine of 2x raised to the second power in order to differentiate that expression we need to work with the outside function more specifically the exponents so when you differentiate x squared it becomes 2 x to the first power we're going to do something similar here so we're going to move the 2 to the front we're going to keep the inside part the same so we're going to be right side of 2x and then we're going to subtract the exponent by 1. 2 minus 1 is 1. next we can work our way towards the inside the derivative of sine is cosine and the derivative of two x is two so the final answer is four sine two x cosine two x one problem that i wanted to give before that was this one the derivative of sine squared of x but now that you know how to do the previous one you can certainly do this one so just like before i would recommend moving the exponent to the outside it makes the whole problem a lot easier so we're going to move it to the front we're going to have 2 and then we're going to keep the inside part the same subtract the exponent by 1 so it's 2 sine raised to the first power and then we're going to take the derivative of the inside function which is cosine now 2 sine x cosine x is also equal to sine 2x it's a double angle formula so you can write your final answer like this if you want or you could leave it like this now what about this problem what is the derivative of sine of tangent x squared go ahead and try that so we're going to begin by differentiating sine the derivative of sine is cosine and whatever is inside of sine that's going to be inside of cosine now let's move on to the next one the derivative of tangent is secant squared and the angle of tangent is x squared so the angle of secant squared will be x squared next let's work our way in the derivative of x squared is 2x and so that is the answer to the problem which we can write as 2x cosine of tangent x squared times secant squared x squared
