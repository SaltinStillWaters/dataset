Transcript for: Mean Value Theorem
so let's talk about the mean value theorem what's the basic idea behind it so let's say if we have a function f of x let's say it looks like this let's call this point a and point b now if the function f of x if it's continuous on the closed interval a b and if it's differentiable on the open interval a b then there's some number c where f prime of c is equal to f of b minus f of a divided by b minus a so what does this mean on the left side this represents the instantaneous rate of change which is the same as the slope of the tangent line on the right side this is the average rate of change which represents the slope of the secant line now the secant line is the line that touches two points on a curve so we're going to focus on the points a and b to draw the secant line draw a line that passes through both points now the secant line has to be parallel to the tangent line because they're equal to each other they have the same slope and notice that here the tangent line will have the same slope as the secant line they're both horizontal in this case now keep this in mind the secant line touches the curve at two points the tangent line only touches the curve at one point so therefore c is right in the middle between a and b in this example so anytime you have a closed interval if the function is continuous on a closed interval and if it's differentiable on the open interval there's always going to be some number c where the slope of the tangent line is equal to the slope of the secant line where those two lines will be parallel to each other now let's look at another graphical example so let's say this time we have a graph that looks like this and let's say here's a and here's b now is the function continuous on the closed interval a b yes it is there's no jumps no discontinuities no vertical asymptotes is it differentiable on the open interval a b yes it is there are no sharp turns in this graph so therefore we could say that the instantaneous rate of change at c will equal the average rate of change between a and b so in other words the tangent line is going to be parallel to the secant line so the slopes of the tangent line and the secant line will be equal to each other now you've seen this equation in this form the slope between two points is y2 minus y1 divided by x2 minus x1 and f of x is always equal to y so this is x1 and x2 a and b are x values whereas f of b that's going to be y2 and f of a is y1 so this is basically the slope between two points that's where it comes from now let's draw the secant line so the secant line as you mentioned before touches two points on the curve now what do you think point c is such that it's going to be parallel to the secant line c has to be somewhere in this region because if we draw the tangent line it can only touch the curve at one point so notice that these two lines are parallel to each other so that's what the mean value theorem helps us to do it helps us to find some value c between a and b where the slope of the tangent line is equal to the slope of the secant line so now let's work on some problems so let's say that f of x is equal to x squared minus four x plus one on the interval one to five so first can we apply the mean value theorem to this function on this interval now the parent function x squared looks like this it's basically a parabola now it's been shifted to the right and so we could still see that for any parabola it's always going to be continuous everywhere and differentiable everywhere there's no sharp terms in this graph and there's no discontinuities so for any type of polynomial function be it a cubic function a quadratic function a linear function they're all continuous and differentiable so the mean value theorem can be applied to those functions so all we need to do now is apply this formula f prime of c is equal to f of b minus f of a over b minus a so to find this we need to find the first derivative so the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of negative 4x is negative 4 and for a constant and 0. so f prime of x is going to be two x minus four and then a is one b is five so f of b minus f of a that's gonna be f of five minus f of one over 5 minus 1. now let's evaluate f of 5 separately so that's going to be 5 squared minus 4 times 5 plus one five squared is twenty-five four times five is twenty twenty-five minus twenty is five plus one that's six and then f of one that's going to be one squared minus four plus one so one minus four is negative three negative three plus one is negative two so we have two x minus four is equal to f of five which is six minus f of one which is negative two divided by five minus one which is four so six minus negative two that's six plus two so that's eight eight divided by four is two so let's add four to both sides two plus four is six and then if we divide both sides by two we can see that x is equal to three and three is between one and five so therefore we could say that c is equal to three so this is the value of c that satisfies the mean value theorem over the interval one to five for this function now here's another example that we can work on so let's say that f of x is x raised to the two thirds over the interval zero to one can we apply the mean value theorem to this particular function well let's find out so let's start with a graph x to the two thirds has this general shape so we have a cusp at zero so what that means is that it's not differentiable at x equals zero so can we apply it well to apply the mean value theorem it has to be continuous on the closed interval a to b so a is zero and b is one is it continuous from a and b yes it is there's no jumps no holes no infinite discontinuities no vertical asymptotes is it differentiable on the interval a b that is is it differentiable between zero and one yes or no think about that one so we said that it's not differentiable at x equals zero because at x equals zero we have a cusp now is 0 included in this interval no it's not 0 is included in the closed interval but not on the open interval this interval tells us that x is greater than zero but less than one but doesn't include zero so therefore we can apply the mean value theorem because zero is not included so between zero and one it is differentiable it's not differentiable at exactly when x is zero now let's find the value of c that satisfies the mean value theorem for this problem so let's start with this formula f prime of c is equal to f of b minus f of a divided by b minus a so on the left side let's find the first derivative let's use the power rule so it's going to be two thirds x and then two-thirds minus one that's two over three minus three over three which is negative one over three so that's the first derivative on the right we have f of one minus f of zero over one minus zero now let's rewrite this we can rewrite it as two divided by three x to the positive one third by moving x to the bottom we could change the negative exponent into a positive one now f of one that's going to be one raised to the two thirds one raised to anything is one f of zero zero raised to anything is zero and that's over one minus zero which is just one so on the left we have two over three x to the one third on the right we just have one over one which is one i'm going to cross multiply so two times one is two and then on the other side we'll have three x to the one third so now let's divide both sides by three so two thirds is equal to i wrote x too soon x to the one third is the same as the cube root of x now to get rid of the cube root symbol we need to cube both sides two to the third power is eight three to the third power or 3 times 3 times 3 that's 27 so x is 8 divided by 27 and to get that as a decimal that's approximately 0.296 which is between 0 and 1. and so that's the value of c that satisfies the mean value theorem for this problem now let's work on this problem an absolute value expression let's say if we have the absolute value of 4x minus 5 over the interval 0 to 2. can we apply the mean value theorem to this particular function well let's start with the parent function of the absolute value of x so it has a slope of one and it looks like this so notice that it's not differentiable at zero so keep that in mind now how can we graph this particular function how can we identify the vertex to identify the vertex set the inside part equal to zero and so if we add five to both sides and then divide by four the vertex is going to be five over four which is as a decimal one point two five so let's say that's one and this is two so one point two five will be in that region and the slope is 4. so that's just a rough sketch for this particular graph so is the function continuous on the closed interval a b yes it is there's no holes no vertical asymptotes no type of discontinuities is it differentiable on the open interval a b that is is it differentiable between 0 and 2 now we have a sharp turn at x equals 1.25 so it's not differentiable there and this point lies inside this interval so therefore it is not differentiable on the open interval a b as a result because the second condition wasn't met we cannot apply the mean value theorem to this problem and so there's nothing we can do here all we could say is that it's not differentiable at x equals 5 over 4 or 1.25 and so the mean value theorem cannot be applied let's work on one more problem so let's say that f of x is equal to the square root of x minus 4 over the interval 4 to 8. can we apply the mean value theorem in this example well let's start by drawing the graph so let's start with the parent function the square root of x looks like this and so the square root of x minus 4 is going to be shifted 4 units to the right so we have a graph that looks like that so from 4 to 8 is the function continuous on the closed interval a to b and the answer is yes is it differentiable on the open interval a b since there are no sharp turns the answer is yes so therefore we can apply mean value theorem uh to this particular problem so let's start with this equation f prime of c is equal to f of b minus f of a divided by b minus a so in this example we can see that a is four and b is eight so first let's find the first derivative we can rewrite it as x minus four raised to the one half so it's going to be one half x minus four and then one half minus one is negative one half and then the derivative of the inside function x minus four is one and that's equal to f of b minus f of a over b minus a so now let's rewrite this expression we're going to move this to the bottom to make the negative exponent positive and so it's going to be 1 divided by 2 times x minus 4 raised to the one-half and that's going to equal f of 8 which is the square root of eight minus four and then f of four which is the square root of four minus four and then eight minus four is four so on the left we can rewrite that as the square root of x minus four and then eight minus four is four and the square root of four is two four minus four is zero and so this is what we now have and if we cross multiply now one times four is four and then two times two is four and then we could divide both sides by four four divided by four is one now to get rid of the square root we need to square both sides one squared is one and so that's equal to x minus 4 and then if we add 4 to both sides 1 plus 4 is 5. so x is equal to 5 in this case so that is the value of c which is in between a and b it's between four and eight so always make sure c is between a and b and so that's it now you know how to apply the mean value theorem and you know how to use it to find the number c that satisfies the mean value theorem on a closed interval a to b so remember to apply the mean value theorem it has to be continuous on the closed interval a to b and it has to be differentiable on the open interval a to b and if that's the case then you need to find the value of c where the slope of the tangent line is equal to the slope of the secant line you
