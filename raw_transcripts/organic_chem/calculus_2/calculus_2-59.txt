now let's start the video quiz for each of these problems pause the video and work on it once you have your answer unpause it to see the solution so let's go ahead and begin for number one if we plug in 2 notice that we will get 4 in the bottom we won't get a 0 in the denominator of the fraction so therefore we can use direct substitution to get the answer so let's replace x with 2 so it's going to be 2 squared plus 7 times 2 plus 6 divided by 2 plus 2. now 2 squared is 4 7 times 2 is 14 plus 6 and 2 plus 2 is 4. now 4 14 plus 6 is 20 and 20 plus 4 that's 24 and 24 divided by that number was supposed to be 4. 24 divided by 4 is 6. so this is the value of the limit which means that answer choice b is the correct answer number two find the value of the limit shown below now if we try to use direct substitution in the denominator we're going to get a zero so we don't want to do that what we need to do is factor so how can we factor the numerator what two numbers multiply to negative 15 but add to the middle coefficient of positive two this is going to be positive five and negative three so to factor it's gonna be x plus five times x minus three now on the bottom we can factor x squared minus nine because they're perfect squares the square root of x squared is x and the square root of nine is three one of them is going to be plus the other is going to be minus notice that we can cancel x minus 3. so now we can evaluate the limit as x approaches 3 of x plus 5 divided by x plus three so it's going to be three plus five divided by three plus three and so that's eight divided by six which reduces to four divided by three if you divide both numbers by two so therefore d is the right answer number three calculate the value of the limit shown below so whenever you have a complex fraction what you want to do is multiply the top and the bottom by the common denominator the common denominator being 4x so on the top you want to distribute 4x times one over x is four four x is the same as four x over one and you can see the x variables will cancel leaving behind four so therefore we now have is the limit as x approaches four and on top we have positive four now if we multiply four x by one over four you can see that the fours will cancel leaving behind x and there's a negative sign in front so it's going to be minus x and on the bottom we're just going to rewrite x minus 4 and 4 minus x now these two factors look very similar but they're not exactly the same so what we're going to do is we're going to factor out a negative 1. if we do so negative x will change into positive x and positive 4 will change into negative 4. and it's at this point that we can get rid of the x minus four so now we have the limit as x approaches four of negative one divided by four x now we can use direct substitution so this is going to be negative 1 over 4 times 4 which gives us a final answer of negative 1 divided by 16 which means c is the right answer number four find the value of the limit so here we have a rational function with a square root on the top in a situation like this you need to multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate of the numerator the conjugate is going to be the same thing but you got to change the negative sign into a positive sign and whatever you do to the top you must also do to the bottom now on top we're going to foil the square root of x times the square root of x is equal to x the square root of x times 4 that's going to be positive 4 square root x and negative 4 times the square root of x is going to be what you see here and finally we have negative 4 times 4 which is negative 16. in the denominator we're not going to foil we're just going to rewrite what we have so we can see that the two middle terms add up to zero and they're going to disappear so now what we have is the limit as x approaches 16 of x minus 16 divided by x minus 16 times the square root of x plus four so now we can cancel x minus sixteen and at this point we can replace x with sixteen so this is going to be one divided by the square root of sixteen plus four the square root of sixteen is four and four plus four is eight so the answer is one divided by eight which corresponds to answer choice a number five evaluate the limit so we can't plug in seven if we plug in seven it's gonna be zero over zero which is indeterminate and we don't know if that's equal to zero infinity doesn't exist or one or negative one so we need to check the left side and the right sided limit so let's start with the left side as x approaches seven from the left let's call this f of x so we're going to substitute a number that's close to 7 but from the left let's use 6.9 6.9 minus 7 is negative point one and the absolute value of negative point one is positive point one and when you divide that by negative point one you're going to get negative one so therefore that is the limit as x approaches seven from the left side it's equal to negative one now what about from the right side what is the limit as x approaches seven from the right side so let's plug in a number that's greater than 7 but close to it let's try 7.1 so 7.1 minus 7 is equal to positive 0.1 and the absolute value of positive 0.1 is positive 0.1 divided by itself that's going to equal positive 1. so notice that the left side and the right side do not match so therefore the limit does not exist which means e is the answer number six what is the value of the limit of the trigonometric function shown below just by looking at it it's going to be 3 divided by 5 for those of you who just want a quick answer so it turns out answer choice b is the right answer but let's do some work to get our answer so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to replace tangent with sine divided by cosine so tan 3x is sine 3x divided by cosine 3x and we still have this 5x on the bottom so i can write it as 1 over 5x now what i need to have under sine 3x is a 3x i'm going to multiply the top and the bottom by 3. so i'm going to trade places with the cosine and the 3 i'm also going to move the x in that position as well so this is all equal to the limit as x approaches 0 sine three x divided by three x times the limit as x approaches zero i still have a three on top and already move the 3x to the left so on the bottom i have a 5 and a cosine 3x which i'm going to write as 1 over cosine 3x so now i'm going to use substitution let's say that y is equal to 3x so therefore this limit expression becomes the following expression the limit as y approaches 0 of sine y divided by y times the limit as x approaches zero and here this is a function based on x so this is gonna be one over cosine three x times three over five now the limit as y approaches zero of sine y divided by y that's equal to one you just need to know that formula you can always plug in a small value of x and you can confirm that as one cosine zero if we replace x with zero three times zero is still zero cosine zero is equal to one but i'll replace that in the next step so what we have is one times one times three over five which gives us a final answer of three divided by five so therefore answer choice b is the right answer number seven find the horizontal asymptote of the function shown below using limits to do so we need to find the limit as x approaches infinity of the function 5x plus 8x squared divided by three x plus two x squared plus five now keep in mind when x becomes very large five x is insignificant compared to eight x squared if you replace x with a thousand five thousand is not significant to eight million and three is not significant to two million so therefore this expression becomes equivalent to the limit as x approaches infinity of eight x squared divided by two x squared plus five you can only do this when x becomes very large mathematically it works out eight divided by two is four and you can cancel the x squares because they're the same so what we now have is four plus five which is equal to nine so therefore nine is the final answer and that's going to be the horizontal asymptote it's an equation and y equals nine so e is the right answer number eight which the following is equivalent to the limit shown below so go ahead and take a minute and try this problem now we need to know is that the sine function oscillates between one and negative one this is the graph of sine x now the only difference between sine x and sine one over x is how fast it oscillates as you approach an x value of zero it begins to oscillate faster and faster however the amplitude still varies between one and negative one so it really doesn't matter the angle or the fact that we have a one over x within sine because as x approaches zero one over x does not exist as x approaches zero from the left 1 over x becomes negative infinity and as x approaches 0 from the right 1 over x becomes positive infinity but that doesn't matter for the sine function because it's always going to alternate between negative 1 and 1. so we can make this statement sine of one over x will always be between negative one and one now if we multiply everything by x we can get this expression negative x is between sine is between x sine one over x and it's between positive x so x sine 1 over x is between negative x and positive x that's what i meant to say now what we can use is the squeeze term so basically the squeeze term states that let's call this h of x and let's say f of x is between h of x and g of x if the limit as x approaches zero of h of x and g of x if they're the same then the limit as x approaches f of x must also be the same so that's the main idea behind the squeeze term so the limit as x approaches zero for h of x which is really negative x well that's equal to zero now the limit as x approaches zero of g of x which in this case is positive x that two is equal to zero so therefore the limit as x approaches x sine of one over x since it's between negative x and x it too must also equal zero so therefore b is the right answer according to the squeeze term number nine verify that the intermediate value theorem applies to the indicated interval and find the value of c guaranteed by the theorem so based on the intermediate value theorem you need to know that it states that f has to be continuous on the closed interval a to b and that f of a cannot equal f of b and there is some number k which is between f of a and f b such that f c is equal to k and c has to be in the interval of a and b so we got to find that value of c such that k is between f and f b notice that we have the value of k k is whatever number f c is equal to so therefore k is zero so first we've got to show that f of a and f of b well we have to show that zero is between f and f b we have to prove that the ivt term applies so let's find f of a where a is zero and b is two so f of zero is going to be zero squared plus four times zero minus five so f of zero is negative five now let's calculate f of b which is f of two so that's gonna be two squared plus four times two minus five two squared is four four times two is eight four plus eight is twelve minus five that's seven so the intermediate value theorem does apply to the indicated interval as we can see k which is zero is in between negative five and seven so now that we know that the ivt theorem applies we can now find the value of c so let's set f of c equal to zero so basically set the function f of x replace it with zero and find the value of x so zero is equal to x squared plus four x minus five now we need to factor two numbers that multiply to negative five but add to positive four are positive five and negative one therefore we can see that x is equal to negative five and positive one if you reverse the signs if you set x plus five equal to zero x will equal negative five and if you set x minus one equal to zero x will equal positive one now one of these values is the c value that we're looking for so c has to be in the interval a to b that is between zero and two negative five is not between zero and 2 but 1 is so therefore c is equal to 1 which means d is the right answer number 10 find the value of c that will make the function continuous at x equals two the first thing we need to do is set these two functions equal to each other so seven x squared plus c x is equal to two x cubed plus five c plus three now we need to find the value of c when x is two so let's replace x with two and then after that all we have to do is just algebra two squared is four four times seven is twenty-eight two to the third is eight times two is sixteen so now let's subtract both sides by 2c so these will cancel on the left we have 28 and we can combine like terms 16 plus 3 is 19. and 5c minus 2c is 3c now let's subtract both sides by 19. 28 minus 19 is 9. so 9 is equal to 3c so if we divide both sides by 3 we can see that c is nine divided by three which is three and that is the answer so answer choice c is correct
