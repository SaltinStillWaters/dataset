consider this problem what is the limit as x approaches infinity of the function that is the inverse tangent of x how can we find the answer it helps to know what the graph of inverse tan or arc tangent of x looks like there's two horizontal asymptotes the first one is y equals pi over two and the second horizontal asymptote is y equals negative pi over two and the graph of arc tangent of x looks like this it stays in between these two asymptotes so knowing that as x approaches positive infinity this is the x-axis this is the y so as x increases we just follow the graph as it goes to the right notice that the y value approaches pi over two and this is the answer the limit as x approaches infinity of arc tangent of x is equal to pi over two now let's say if we want to find the limit as x approaches negative infinity of the same function our tangent of x well in this case negative infinity lies towards the left positive infinity is on the right side so we need to follow the curve all the way to the left and notice that it approaches negative pi over two this graph will continue to travel horizontally staying within the lower horizontal asymptote so the answer is negative pi over two and it's very easy to evaluate a limit if you know the graph of a function so when evaluating limits of inverse trigonometric functions it's very very helpful if you can if you memorize the shape of the graphs or if you have access to them now let's try another example what is the limit as x approaches two of arc tangent of x and this is going to be let's see one divided by x minus two in this problem we can't use direct substitution because we're going to have our tangent of one over two minus two and getting a 0 in the denominator of a fraction will make it undefined so direct substitution is not going to work in this example now when x approaches 2 what's going to happen the expression 1 over x minus 2 can go to infinity but we need to be careful with this one we need to break it up into one sided limits let's start with when x approaches 2 from the left side so imagine if x was 1.999 if you type in 1 divided by 1.999 minus 2 this will give you negative 1 000 so you get a very large negative number this tells us that the limit approaches well this expression 1 over x minus 2 approaches negative infinity so we have the limit as well rather let me take that back we have our tangent of negative infinity and we know that our tangent of a negative infinity value that's going to give us negative pi over 2 based on this limit now we need to check not just the left-sided limit but the right-sided limit as well so that is when x approaches 2 from the right side of arc tangent 1 over x minus 2. so from the right side if we were to plug in two point zero zero one one over two point zero zero one minus two make sure to put those last two numbers in parenthesis this will give you positive a thousand which indicates that one over x minus two approaches positive infinity and what you could do is you can graph the rational function so we have a vertical asymptote at x equals 2. now this rational function is bottom heavy meaning that the degree of the denominator is higher than the degree of the numerator so therefore we have another horizontal asymptote which is y equals zero any time you have a rational function as bottom heavy now if we plug in 3 we would get 1. so let's say this is a y value of 1 and if we were to plug in 1 1 over x minus two will be negative one so this indicates that the shape of the graph looks something like this so it's bounded by the vertical and the horizontal asymptotes so as x approaches 2 from the left side we can see that it's going towards a y value of negative infinity which is what we get here and as x approaches 2 this is the vertical asymptote x equals 2. from the right side notice that it goes up towards positive infinity because plug-in 2.001 gave us a large positive answer and we see the graph agrees with that so as x approaches 2 from the right the expression 1 over x minus 2 approaches positive infinity so we have our tangent of positive infinity or if you want to you can write it this way you can now say this is equal to the limit as x approaches positive infinity of arc tangent of x and we know that's going to equal posit positive rather pi over 2 based on this answer now notice that the left sided limit and the right side of the limit are not the same because they're different the original limit does not exist and so that is the answer for this problem the limit doesn't exist now let's work on another example what is the limit as x approaches infinity of arc cosine one over x go ahead and try that so let's begin with the graph of one over x the graph of one over x looks like this it has a vertical asymptote at x equals zero which is here and a horizontal asymptote of y equals zero which is here because it's bottom heavy so if we follow the curve as x increases towards positive infinity this curve approaches a y value of zero so the limit as x approaches infinity for the expression one over x becomes zero so this is equal to arc cosine of zero now what is the arc cosine of zero well we could start with the graph of arc cosine of x arc cosine of x has a limited domain the domain varies from negative 1 to positive one and a range is from zero to pi so i'm going to extend this so let's say this is pi over two and this is pi now hopefully you remember your trigonometric values cosine of zero is one so in this case when x is one the y value will be zero cosine of pi over two is equal to zero so when x is zero y will be pi over two and then cosine of pi is equal to negative one so when x is negative one y will be equal to pi and so the graph looks something like that so what is arc cosine of zero all you need to do is basically reverse that equation if cosine pi over 2 is 0 r cosine of 0 is pi over 2. so here's 0 0 is basically the y axis that's when x is zero as we approach zero from the left you can see the y value approaches pi over two as we approach zero from the right the y value approaches pi over two so the left sided and the right side limits are the same so that's r cosine of 0 is just going to be pi over 2. so that's the answer for that particular problem let's work on one more example let's say we have the limit as x approaches positive infinity of the expression arc sine 5 plus 2 x cubed divided by four x cubed minus eight go ahead and try when we're dealing with limits at infinity what we can do with the rational function is we can multiply the top and the bottom by 1 over x cubed and so if we do that we're going to have the limit as x approaches infinity of arcsin and then we're going to have 5 over x cubed plus 2 divided by 4 minus 8 over x cubed now the limit as x approaches infinity for 1 over x cubed times some constant that's gonna be zero because it's bottom heavy a constant divided by a thousand raised to the third power will be approximately zero so this will become zero that will become zero so what we're going to have is the arc sine of two over four which is equal to the arc sine of one half now sine of what angle is equal to one half keep in mind sine has a limited domain and range i mean arc sine the domain for arc sine is negative i mean yeah negative one to one and the range is negative pi over two to pi over two now sine on the other hand has an unlimited domain negative infinity to infinity and the range is negative one to one that's sine but for arc sine it has a limited domain so you need to pick an answer between quadrant one and quadrant four so sine of what angle is one half this is sine pi over six so therefore the arc sine of one half is gonna equal pi over six you simply need to swap these two so this is the answer to the problem here is the graph of arc sine it has a domain from negative one to one and a range from negative pi over two to pi over two so it only exists in quadrants three and four of the unit circle sine of pi over two is one sine of negative pi over two is negative one and sine of zero is zero and the graph looks something like this so pi over six will be somewhere in this region which is my graph is not perfect but it's supposed to be around a half so as you approach pi over six you get a value of one half or as you approach one half on the x-axis the y-value is pi over six now one thing you need to be careful with is that sine five pi over six is one half but you wouldn't say the arc sine of one half is five pi over six because five pi over six is not in the range of arc sine so just be careful with that so the answer for this problem is just pi over six so that's it for this video so now you know how to solve uh limits dealing with inverse trigonometric functions thanks again for watching
