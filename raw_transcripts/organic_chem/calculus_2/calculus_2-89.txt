Transcript for: Higher Order Derivatives
in this video we're going to focus on finding higher order derivatives so let's say if we have the function f of x and it's equal to 3x to the fifth power plus 2x cubed minus 6x plus 4. and in this problem go ahead and determine the second derivative of the function well we need to find the first derivative to begin so the derivative of x to the fifth using the power rule is 5x to the fourth and the derivative of x cubed is three x squared and the derivative of x is one and the derivative of a constant is zero so this is going to give us 15 x to the fourth two times three is six and so this is the first derivative now we need to differentiate this expression one more time to get the second derivative so if we differentiate x to the fourth that's going to be 4x cubed and the derivative of x squared is 2x so the second derivative is going to be 15 times 4 which is 60 and 6 times 2 is 12. so it's going to be 60x cubed plus 12x now let's try another problem let's say that h of x is x squared cosine x go ahead and determine the second derivative of this function now for this problem we need to use the product rule the derivative of f times g is going to be the derivative of the first part f prime plus or times the second part plus the first part times the derivative of the second part so we could say that f is x squared and g is cosine so if f is x squared f prime has to be 2x and if g is cosine g prime the derivative of cosine is going to be negative sine so using this formula h prime of x is going to equal the derivative of the first part which is 2x times the second part that's cosine plus the first part which is just f4 x squared times the derivative of the second part which is negative sine x now we could factor the expression or we could leave it like this right now it's best to leave it the way it is so we have 2x cosine x minus x squared sine x now let's go ahead and find the second derivative so we're going to have to use the product rule twice for this term and for that one so for the first term let's separate it into two functions so this is the first part that's f and here's the second part g so h double prime is going to be the derivative of the first part the derivative of two x is two and then times second part which we're going to leave the same cosine plus we're going to keep the first part the same that's f times g prime the derivative of the second part the derivative of cosine is negative sine now let's focus on x squared sine x so let's say this is f and this is going to be g so the derivative of the first part x squared is 2x times the second and then plus the first part x squared times the derivative of the second part which is cosine so now let's rewrite everything so we have 2 cosine x minus 2x sine x and don't forget to distribute this negative sign so minus another 2x sine x minus x squared cosine x so it looks like we can combine like terms so the final answer is going to be 2 cosine x minus 4x sine x minus x squared cosine x so that's h double prime now let's say if f of x is equal to the square root of x and we need to find the third derivative f triple prime of x how can we do so so go ahead and try that problem now first we need to rewrite the expression so the square root of x is the same as x to the one half and let's use the power rule so keep in mind the power rule is n x raised to the n minus one so it's going to be one half x raised to the one half minus one now one half minus one is basically one half minus two over two which is a negative one over two so this is the first derivative now i wouldn't recommend rewriting it and simplifying it yet until you find the third derivative so let's go ahead and find the second derivative while it's in this form so the derivative of x to the negative one-half that's going to be negative one-half x and then negative one-half minus one now one-half times negative one-half that's negative one-fourth and negative one-half minus one think of negative one-half minus two over two negative one minus two is negative three so this is going to be x raised to negative three over two now let's find the third derivative so using the constant multiple rules can be negative 1 4 times the derivative of that expression so that's negative 3 over 2 x raised to the negative three over two minus one now negative one times negative three that's going to be positive three and then four times two is eight now negative three over two minus one or negative three over two minus two over two that's negative five over two so this is the answer all we need to do is simplify or rewrite it so right now the third derivative is equal to 3x to the negative 5 over 2 divided by 8. now to make the negative exponent positive we need to move the variable to the bottom so it's going to be 3 over 8 x raised to the positive 5 over two now we can convert this into its radical form so it's three over eight square root x to the fifth power now we could still simplify this expression further if we want to x to the fifth is x to the fourth times x and the square root of x to the fourth keep in mind the index number is two so it's four over two which is two so it's going to be x squared that's the square root of x to the fourth now we could still rationalize the denominator if you want to so if we multiply the top and the bottom by the square root of x we're going to have 3 square root x over 8 x squared times the square root of x squared which is x and x squared times x is x cubed so you can write your answer as 3 square root x divided by 8 x cubed if you want to fully simplify it and rationalize the denominator at the same time now let's work on one more problem let's say if you're given the second derivative and it's 5 over x squared go ahead and determine the fourth derivative of the function now first we need to rewrite the expression so i'm going to move this to the top so this is the same as five x to the negative two so we already have the second derivative let's find a third so we need to find the derivative of five x to the negative two so it's going to be five times the derivative of x to the negative two which is negative two x to the negative two minus one which is negative three and so five times negative two that's negative ten so the third derivative is negative ten x to the negative third so now we need to find the fourth derivative so it's going to be negative 10 times the derivative of x to the negative third which is negative 3 x to the negative 3 minus 1 which is negative 4. and negative ten times negative three is thirty so we have thirty x to the negative four which we can rewrite as thirty divided by x to the fourth power and so if you're given the second derivative you need to differentiate it two more times to get to the fourth derivative and so that's just the basis of higher order derivative problems you just gotta find the second third or fourth derivative
