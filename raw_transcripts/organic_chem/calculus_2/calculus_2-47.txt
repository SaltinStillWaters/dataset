Transcript for: Logarithms - e - Euler's Number
have you ever wondered what is e and where it comes from perhaps you've been exposed to this letter in math where you see the function f of x is equal to e to the x or maybe you've seen it when dealing with logarithms for instance let's say if we have log five if you don't see a base the base is always base ten but what about natural logs let's say ln5 the base of a natural log is e so this is the same as log base e of 5. so e is found in many areas of math but what is e e is a number e is equal to 2.718281828 and there's some other numbers after that but that's what it is but let's talk about where it comes from and how we can calculate that number so one way in which we can get this number is through this formula the compound interest formula where a is the future amount p is the principal or the original investment times 1 plus the interest rate received divided by n raised to the n t n is the number of times that you are paid interest in a year and t is the number of years so let's say that you invest a dollar for one year so t is going to be equal to one and we're going to say that the interest rate is a hundred percent 100 as a decimal is just one so if you are paid once in this year how much money will you have at the end well your one dollar investment will grow to two dollars at 100 interest but what about this is when n is one because you're paid once a year what if you're paid 100 but semi-annually that is two times in a year so n would be two in this case plugging everything into this formula you'll have p is one r is one n is two and t is going to be one so it's just gonna be one plus one half raised to the second power so after the end of the year you're going to have two dollars and 25 cents now instead of being paid the 100 interest twice a year what if was broken up into four times a year let's say if you receive quarterly payments in this case n would be four so it's going to be one plus one over four raised to the fourth power at the end of the year you'll have two dollars and 44 cents now what about if it's compounded monthly let's say if you receive 12 interest payments in one year so it's going to be 1 plus 1 over 12 raised to the 12 power which is 2.61 cents and then let's say if the interest was paid out daily that is if n is 365 this is going to be one plus one over 365 raised to the 365. you'll get two dollars and 71 cents now it turns out that as n approaches infinity that is if it's compounding continuously you'll get e which is 2.718 2 8 and so forth and you could test it out if you plug in a very large number for n you're going to get e so for instance if you plug in one plus one over let's say n is a million or one times ten to the sixth if you type this into your calculator you're going to get 2.718280469 which is approximately e so that's we could say that the limit as n goes to infinity of the expression 1 plus 1 over n raised to the n is e so that's where the number e comes from at least that's one way in which you can calculate it there are some other mathematical expressions that will give us the value of e here's another one the limit as n goes to zero of 1 plus n raised to the 1 over n is also e so if we were to make a table of values you can test this out if n is one you're gonna get two now if n is point one you'll get this number two point five nine three seven four two four six if n is point zero one you'll get two point seven zero four eight and then if you put .001 this will be 2.716924 0.0001 or one times ten to the minus four it'll give you a number that's close to e two point seven one eight one four five nine two and then if you use one to times ten to the minus six you'll get a number that's very close to e so as you can see for this particular expression as n gets very very small as it gets closer and closer to zero the expression one plus n raised to the one over n approaches e as we can see here in this table so that's another formula that can help you to calculate the value of e but we're not quite done yet because there is another way in which you can get the value of e it turns out that if you take the sum of one over n factorial from n equals zero to infinity this will also give you e so zero factorial if we have one plus i mean one over zero factorial plus one over 1 factorial plus 1 over 2 factorial we're not going to add all of it but we're just going to get a few numbers to see how close this gets to e let's stop at one over eight factorial zero factorial is one so one over one is one one factorial is also one two factorial is two so we get one half three factorial that's three times two times one which is six so this is gonna be one over six four factorial is four times three times two times one which is 24. 5 factorial just multiply 24 by 5 and that will give you 120 6 factorial just multiply 120 by 6 you get 720 7 factorial multiply seven twenty by seven you should get five thousand forty and eight factorial multiply five thousand forty by eight and you'll get forty thousand three hundred twenty now go ahead and plug these numbers into your calculator and see what value you get so this is equal to two point seven one eight two seven eight seven which is approximately e now granted if you keep adding more numbers like one like plus one over nine factorial plus one over ten factorial it's going to get closer and closer to e but as you go to infinity you'll get the value of e now there are also some other applications of e which is also known as euler's number for instance consider the graph y equals e to the x which looks like this the derivative of e to the x is also e to the x so what this means is that if you take the slope at any point of this function the slope of the tangent line is going to equal the y value at that point so y is going to equal m at some value of x so that's one interesting property of e or e to the x another one has to do with the area it turns out that the area is also equal to the y value of the graph so let's say let me draw another picture so let's say we want to find the area all the way from the left to some value x the area under the curve can be calculated by taking the definite integral of f of x from a to b in this case since we're starting all the way from the left a would be negative infinity so the area will be the integral from negative infinity to x of e to the x dx the antiderivative of e to the x is e c x now evaluated from a to b this is going to be e to the x minus e to the negative infinity e to the negative infinity is basically eats its zero or one over e to the infinity so you just get e to the x and since y is equal to e to the x thus we could say that y is equal to the area so the height of the graph at some value of x is equal to the area under the curve from negative infinity to x for this particular function so that's basically it so now you know what the value of e is how to calculate it and some applications associated with the number e thanks for watching
