Transcript for: Extreme Value Theorem
in this video we're going to focus on the extreme value theorem and it says that if f is continuous on a closed interval a to b then the function f has both a minimum and a maximum on the interval so let's illustrate it so let's say if we have some graph and we have a curve on a graph and both of these are endpoints because it has to be a closed interval so the first point is a the second point is b according to the extreme value theorem there's going to be a minimum and a maximum on this interval and there is so this point represents the absolute maximum because it's the highest point on the closed interval a to b and this point here represents the absolute minimum because it is the lowest point on the interval a to b for the function f now let's go over some more examples where you need to identify the extrema on a graph here's another one so let's say if we have a graph that looks like this identify all of the extrema on this graph so let's call this a b and this point c and d so at b we have the absolute actually that is not the absolute maximum the absolute maximum is here that's the highest point on the graph it's not the end point b anymore but it still exists in the interval a to b since we have a closed interval and a is the lowest point of the graph so that's the absolute minimum but in this example we have two other things that we need to pay attention to notice that at point d this is known as a local minimum also known as a relative minimum and at c we have another relative extra so that's a local max or a relative max now notice that we can draw a horizontal tangent line at c and at d and there's something called fermat's theorem if f has a local maximum or a local minimum at some point c or it could be another letter and if f prime of c exists then f prime of c is zero so here's c and here's d so at point c we have a relative maximum and according to fermat's theorem f prime of c is going to equal zero because we do have a point that exists in a function so anytime you have a horizontal tangent line the derivative will be zero at that point so f prime of d is also zero and any time you have the first derivative function being equal to zero then those points are known as critical numbers so c and d are critical numbers of the function so anytime f prime of c is equal to zero or even if it doesn't exist you have a critical number at that point now let's look at some more examples go ahead and identify the extrema for this one let's say this is point a let's call this b and c and also let's focus on this one so let's call this point a b c and d feel free to pause the video identify all of the extreme values in this function so notice that at point c we have a absolute maximum it's the highest point but we don't have an absolute minimum and it makes sense why we don't have both because we do not have a closed interval in fact we have an open interval from a to b since we have open circles at both point a and b so notice that a appears to be the lowest point in the graph but it's not actually a point so therefore this is not an absolute minimum if it was a closed circle then it would be an absolute minimum now on the graph on the right b represents an absolute minimum because we do have a closed point at b but we don't have a closed interval because there is a break between c and d so the extreme value theorem would not apply in this example notice that there is no absolute maximum this point appears to be the highest point even though it's a whole but it's not an absolute max if it was a closed circle then it would be an absolute max so watch out for the open circles whenever you have a graph you
