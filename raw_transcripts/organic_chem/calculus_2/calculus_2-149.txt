Transcript for: Indefinite Integral
in this video we're going to focus on integrating polynomial functions and just some basic functions in general so what is the anti-derivative of 3x minus x to the fourth go ahead and try this problem now we could use the power rule the anti-derivative of x to the n is going to be x raised to the n plus one divided by n plus one plus c so this is three x to the first power and if you want to you could separate it into two separate integrals you don't have to do this but you could do it if you want to so the antiderivative of x is x squared divided by two but multiplied by three and for x to the fourth it's going to be x to the fifth over five plus some constant c and so that's it for the first example and let's try some other problems so go ahead and determine the antiderivative of 6x squared plus the square root of x now the first thing i would recommend doing is rewriting the expression the square root of x is x to the one half now let's use the power rule so first let's determine the antiderivative of x squared it's x cubed divided by three and four x to the one half one half plus one is one point five or three over two and instead of dividing it by three over two you can multiply by two over three one divided by three over two is the same as two over three now we can simplify six divided by three is two so the final answer is two x cubed times two thirds x raised to the three halves plus c and so that's it for this problem now let's find the indefinite integral of this expression x plus 5 times 2x minus 3. so what do you think we need to do for this problem well we can't use like a product rule for integration if you see a problem like this it's best to foil before you integrate so x times 2x that's going to be 2x squared and then x times negative 3 we have negative 3x and then 5 times 2x is 10x and then 5 times negative 3 is negative 15. and now let's combine like terms so negative 3x plus 10x that's going to be 7 x so this is what we now have so now we can find the anti-derivative the anti-derivative of 2x squared is 2x to the third power divided by 3 and for x to the first power it's going to be x squared over 2 and if you find the anti-derivative of any constant it's always going to be just add an x in front of it so the anti-derivative of negative 15 is negative 15 x and then plus c and that's it for this problem try this problem go ahead and find the antiderivative of three x plus four squared now you don't want to integrate it in this form instead you want to foil three x plus four so this is equivalent to three x plus four times another three x plus four so 3x times 3x that's 9x squared and then we have 3x times 4 which is 12x and 4 times 3x that's also 12x and then 4 times 4 which is 16. now let's combine like terms 12 plus 12 is twenty four so we now have nine x squared plus twenty four x plus sixteen so now we can find the anti-derivative so for x squared it's going to be x cubed over 3 and 4 x to the first power is going to become x squared over 2 and the antiderivative of a constant like 16 is just 16x and don't forget to add c the constant of integration now let's simplify what we have so the final answer is going to be 9 divided by 3 which is 3 24 divided by 2 is 12 plus 16x plus c and so this is the answer now what if you're given a fraction for instance let's say if we have x to the fifth power plus 4x cubed minus 5x all divided by x squared how can we integrate this particular function now the first thing you should do is divide every term in the numerator by x squared this works if this is a monomial if there's only one term in the denominator and so you want to separate it into three fractions and then you want to integrate the expression so x to the fifth divided by x squared 5 minus 2 is 3 so that becomes x cubed and then 4x cubed divided by x squared that's 4x and then 5x over x squared x squared you can see it as x times x so you can cancel the next variable and so you're left with 5 over x with the negative sign as well now before we integrate because we have a rational function we need to rewrite the expression so let's move the x variable to the top so it's going to change from x to the positive one to x raised to the negative one so we have x cubed plus four x to the first power minus five x raised to the negative one power actually you know what we don't need to do that i take that back i'm gonna leave it as one over x the reason for this is because the anti-derivative of one over x is the natural log of x and that's something that you should keep in mind so the anti-derivative of x cubed is going to be x to the fourth over four and for four x is going to be four x squared over two and then minus five times the natural log of x plus c so we can write the final answer as one-fourth x to the four four divided by two is two and this is it minus 5 ln x plus c now let's work on finding the indefinite integral of trigonometric functions what is the antiderivative of 1 plus tangent squared x dx so go ahead and take a minute and try that problem now this is one of the pythagorean identities that you need to be familiar with 1 plus tangent squared is equal to something and that something is secant squared now what is the antiderivative of secant squared the derivative of which trigonometric function is secant squared the antiderivative of secant squared is tangent so the answer is going to be tangent x plus c and so that's it for this problem let's try another one find the antiderivative of sine x divided by one minus sine squared go ahead and try that now you need to be familiar with another pythagorean identity and that is sine squared plus cosine squared is equal to one so if we take this term and move it to that side we can see that cosine squared is equal to 1 minus sine squared so we can rewrite this expression as sine divided by cosine squared so how does this help us what can we do with this what we need to do at this point is expand cosine squared cosine squared is basically cosine times cosine so i'm going to write this as sine x over cosine x times 1 over cosine x now what is sine divided by cosine sine divided by cosine is tangent and one over cosine is secant the derivative of what function is secant tangent the derivative of secant is secant tangent so the antiderivative of secant tangent is secant so the final answer is secant plus c so you need to review the trigonometric functions and some of the identities need to know the reciprocal identities and the pythagorean identities and i have a playlist on trigonometry if you want to look at that so you can find that at my channel so that's it for this video thanks for watching you
