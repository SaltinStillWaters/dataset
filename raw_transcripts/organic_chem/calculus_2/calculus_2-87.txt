Transcript for: Find The Derivative Using The Chain Rule
what is the derivative of this function the square root of x plus the square root of x plus the square root of x again how can we find the derivative of that expression well we need to use the chain rule because we have functions within other functions now just to review here's how you could use the chain rule so let's say you want to find the derivative of a composite function f of g of x what you need to do first is find the derivative of the function on the outside which will be f prime while keeping the inside the same times the derivative of the inside function and so that's the process by which we could find the derivative of a composite function now for this problem the first thing we need to do is rewrite it so what we have is x plus parentheses x plus x to the half x to the half is the square root of x and then this is raised to the half that's this square root symbol here and then everything is raised to the half for the square root that encompasses now everything first thing we're going to use is the power rule on this exponent here so first we're going to move the one half to the front and then we're going to keep the inside part the same so that's x plus x plus x to the half erase it a half and now we need to subtract this by one one-half minus one is negative one-half now the next thing that we need to do is find the derivative of the inside function the derivative of x is going to be one and then the derivative of this expression we need to move the one half to the front so it's going to be one-half times what we see on the inside we're going to keep that part the same and then subtract this by one one-half minus one that's going to be negative a half now we need to find the derivative of the inside function the derivative of x is one and the derivative of x to the half we need to use the power rule again so it's going to be one half x to the minus one half so all of this represents the derivative of the inside function so this is the answer but what we need to do at this point is we need to clean it up a bit so let's go ahead and do that the negative one-half tells us that we have a square root function but underneath the fraction or on the denominator fraction so we can rewrite this whole expression like this so this one remains on top of the fraction the 2 is on the bottom and all of this will be on the bottom due to the negative exponent so that's going to be the square root of x plus the square root of x plus the square root of x so this entire fraction is going to be multiplied by everything we see here so all of this needs to go on the numerator of that fraction but we're going to do this one step at a time so we have one plus now we need a fraction for this the two is going to be on the bottom and then the negative one half tells us that this expression will be on the bottom but with a radical sign so it's going to be the square root of x and then plus x to the half is the square root of x and then this term is multiplied by what we see here so that's times one plus one half x to the negative one half that's one over two square root x and all of this is multiplied to that expression so we can write the final answer like this so on the bottom we have 2 square root x plus the square root of x plus root x on top we're going to have 1 plus and then we can combine those two things into a single fraction so it's going to be 1 plus 1 over 2 square root x divided by 2. square root x plus square root x so this right here is the final answer so that is the derivative of this expression i'm not going to simplify it any further than that so that's it for this video so now you know how to find the derivative of this function using the chain rule
