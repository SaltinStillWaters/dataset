Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 0.1:  Lines, Angle of Inclination, and the Distance Formula
well welcome to the official start of calculus congratulations you made it in the class today we're going to talk about a review a review of a lot of the math 2 Concepts and some basic algebra Concepts that you really need to have down in order for you to be successful in calculus the first place we're going to start is section 0.1 chapter zero we're going to talk about lines just basic lines we're going to go through some families of Curves we'll get into some trig functions your favorite right and then we'll we'll continue to calculate so that's a weird lines there what's special about a line what do you know about lines two points well they have infinite points but specifically you need at least two right what else you know about lines they curve at all do they curve lines do the end what what do you need to know about a line in order to graph it need two points you need two points or you need one point and specifically one other thing SL you got to have SL lines have slope they're straight they don't end they have slope in fact the slope is what we're going to talk about for the first part of today the slope is pretty much how a line Rises or Falls now you might have been walked through this a long time ago we're going to go really quickly through how to find the slope of a line and we're going to invent the form formula ourselves so let's take a a generic line and we'll pick two random points on it we're not going to be specific on it cuz in order to create a formula you can't really say something specific like any particular point we need to work for all points can you tell me if I've got two points how can I I make a distinction between these what what does every Point have coordinates what are the coordinates somewhere over here what are what are the coordin generally for for a point x y okay so we know that any point that we draw is going to have the coordinates X Y this one will and this one will but the problem is we need some way to tell a difference between those those two points how are we going to do it what do you think num with some yeah with some numbers what are those what numbers one two are they going to go on top of our X or below our X place where now if I put them up here we're talking about x to the first power so we're going to put an x to the an X1 and an X2 a y1 and a Y2 saying that this is our our first point and our second Point whatever those points may be we can't use real numbers because then it wouldn't work in general for any two points can you tell me along the x-axis how far is is this one one X2 if if this is the point X1 y1 how far is that yeah it's X1 for sure how far is this point yeah are you guys with me on this no if you're you're all right so far if you're not go like this are we okay or no all right if this was like the point uh 3 comma 5 to get to 3 comma 5 You' go over three and up five right so then this would be three this is not 3 comma 5 it's X1 y1 so we're going over X1 how far are we going up good and here now when we talk about slope typically a long time ago when you were first introduced a slope you the teacher probably said yeah it's how your your your line Rises or Falls but then they also said slope is defined as what over what let's go ahead let's try to identify what our rise is and what our run is what would you say would be our rise this way this way so if we find the difference between those two numbers over there we're going to find the rise for our line what is the difference between those two numbers over there how do you find the difference this distance here sure yeah if this was 10 and this was three the distance between them would be what yeah You' subtract them right you do 10 minus 3 so here we're going to go well it's not 10 and three it's Y 2 and y1 so our rise we're going to call Y 2us y1 can we do the same thing with the Run how far is our run what's that distance represent or represented as21 I thought you were going to answer you instead you sneezed I was like she's and then darn it so for a good one yeah we got X2 - X1 for sure does that look familiar yeah if we use the letter instead of the word slope what letter we am I talking about here if we use M instead of slope we got our formula which is kind of you've seen it before right You' probably seen have you seen it invented before like this if you haven't well this is something new for you if you have well you've seen it again this is how you invent the slope formula the reason why we couldn't use specific points is because we wanted to be able to plug in any two points that I give you right so using that if you call your your points X1 y1 X2 Y2 you can find a slope for anything now the the one reason why I invented this for you is I want to show you that we can actually create an equation from that equation for a line from that slope formula so let's talk just a bit about equations what we're going to do is we're going to manipulate that formula by fixing one point we're going to be able to get the formula for a line here's what we're going to work with we're going to start with M = Y2 - y1 over X2 - X1 what I'm going to do is I'm going to fix this point say this is any specific one point and let the other one float what that does is it changes this formula into this formula instead of Y2 - y1 there's no more Y2 you see here's the thing a fixed point is a point with a little number under it a subscript like this would be a specific fixed Point X1 y1 this is a specific fixed Point X2 Y2 what I'm doing by fixing one point in only one point I'm saying that's the one point I'm fixing X1 y1 I'm going let the other one be floating so I'm going to Ras that uh Y2 and the X2 that means I'm going to have y - y1 over x - X1 that says one point's fixed this point is going to be formulaic it means you can plug in an X and get out of Y you ever seen an equation for a line not your head you've all seen it because you're all here right it has places for you to plug in X and get out y doesn't it so we need that inherently otherwise we don't have the equation for a line we have a specific two points we don't want that we want the equation for a line and here's a cool thing is there a way that you can solve for y - y1 how would you get rid of this denominator do what now someone said I just have bad ears see multip multiply it on one side or both sides so if I multiply this by oh that work cool x - X1 and over here x - X1 is this gone you guys are so quiet is this gone yeah they can't other for sure for sure on the right hand side tell me what I'm left with on the left hand side I'm going to reorganize this I'm not going to have x - X1 * m I'm going to have M * x - X1 you still okay with that so far multiplication is commutative doesn't matter what I have first what I have second no problem maybe you're not familiar with it written this way but I'll bet you've seen this before that one yeah what is that called no no it's not slope intercept point slope why is it called point slope mathematicians are very unoriginal it's called point slope because it's named after what you need to complete it you need a point and the slope that's why it's called point slope so by manipulating our slope formula interesting is it we used this we fixed only one point let the other one float worked around a little bit we now have point slope pretty useful stuff should we shall we do an example would you like to see something that we can use this stuff with I think you've seen it before this should be reviewed for you but let's go ahead let's see if we can first get the cobs out of your head because I know you weren't doing math over Christmas break were you or holiday break whatever you're doing were you doing math I was I was I was redoing this class to make it extra super special for you you should feel honored but let's go ahead and try to find the equation of the line that passes through these two points we'll get the cobs over our head we'll try to use a slope formula and then use point slope oh what what points so find the equation through these two points whenever your teacher taught you how to find the equation of a line they taught you you need you absolutely have to have two things you have to have one what you have to have one point very good and somebody else you also have to know the got to know the slope or be able to find the slope firstly do we have a point actually we have two of them we're set right do we have a slope is it given to you right now can you find it go ahead and find it by the way I usually do this I'll walk around the room if you need help at this point let me know because now would be a good time for me to help you what I want you to do right now is find the slope if you don't remember how to find the slope you assign X1 y1 to one point X2 Y2 to one point and plug it in that formula okay go ahead and try that right now for okay let's see what y'all did just want the slope for now work on the equation just a second so as far as the slope goes we need to pick one of these points to be X1 y1 another point to be X2 Y2 you just got to make sure it goes XY and it goes 1 one and 22 right those numbers got to be together and you have to have an alphabetical order you can't go YX which is going to be your X1 you all pick neg2 for your X1 doesn't matter it really doesn't matter does it I could pick this one as X1 but then that would have to be y1 so once you pick one letter the rest of them have to fall into place now typically people just want to make it easy and they put this one X1 y1 X2 and Y2 which I'm guessing most of you did that one the other way you you're going to get the same exact slope it's just your if you had a negative or a sign it's going to be in the opposite spot not a big deal let's go ahead and plug this in we have Y2 - y1 what am I going to write down if I'm supposed to do Y2 - y1 right now two like that okay good so we're subtracting but that also has a negative sign I'm be real careful about that I'm going to put in parenthesis to show that I'm subtracting a negative right there what is subtracting a negative what's that become great okay well yeah it ends up being addition and then for X2 - X1 we're going to have our 8 - -2 same idea what is our 2 - three how much we get over can you reduce slopes absolutely what is it okay quick show hands how many people were able to find the the slope good that's starting your everybody that's fine if you're not work on that later okay revisit this try to follow through this example see if you can do on your own and then come up that one half are we done we we're we're about halfway there okay we have the slope do we have a point still if we've got a point and we've got the slope we should be able to fill out point slope it's actually the same exact formula as slope we just have now fixed one point and we have the slope it's kind of good so we know we're going to be filling out Yus y1 check it out if you already have your y1 you can leave it if you want to make it easier on yourself and not deal with those negatives you could use that point that'd be fine as well it doesn't matter what point you have after you've already identified your slope here I'm going to stick with the same one to to keep it kind of continuous for us so we have y what am I gonna write perfect okay again I'm gonna use some parentheses saying that's a negative number in there equals I'm supposed to have my M what's my M uhhuh and X perfect let's clean this up just a little bit we're going to have y + 3 = 12 x + 2 if it's asking for point slope you know what you're done okay that that's it but this isn't exactly the easiest way to graph a line is it like that is there a way we could make it easier what would you do distribute sure we want to get rid of those parentheses we'll distribute that if we distribute the right side I'm still going to have this y + 3 but I'm going to get 12 x + what good 1 12 * 2 that's going to give us one and lastly less St is what yeah if I do that I'm going to get yal 12x that's something we're real familiar with we know how to graph that pretty well on XY AIS what is that called by the way yeah whenever we have y = mx plus b where we have some number time X plus or minus some constant we know that that's going to be that is slope intercept it's pretty easy to graph it gives you what you need to graph a line very quickly and again the reason why it's called SL intercept is that's what you have that M that's our slope what's the B stand for y intercept yeah good Y intercept can to graph it what we just how would you graph something with 12x - 2 can you tell me what is my Y intercept in this case so when we're graphing slope intercept that says if we have ative -2 that means we're going down or left which which what what's that mean down so we know our y says down two that says we're going to put a point right there that's where our minus 2 is coming from next we use our slope from the point that we just graph not the origin but the point we just plotted to find our next Point our slope is what was it is that up or down up up how many and over to the over to the right how many two yeah the positive or negative tells you whether you're going up or down you always go to the right so if we had negative - one2 that would say go down one but you're still going to the right you're always going to the right the plus plus negative tells you up or down you with me on this so far okay good so we're going to go up one y all said to the right two now that we have two points we know that two points delineates a specific line unique line we graph it we make sure we label this and we're done show hands how many people feel okay with graphing these lines using slope formula and the point slope good deal all right now there's a couple more things we got to talk about about lines before we talk about parallel and perpendicular which we're going to do in just a second if I told you that this was a line y equal to some some number c where C's constant what type of line is that let's just they're all straight lines right they're all straight lines that's a straight line well I think you might mean is is this a vertical line or is that a horizontal line horizontal line you know the way you can tell what variable do you have up there that means it's going to cross the y- AIS whatever variable you have says That's The Intercept that you have so there's no way to have this Line crossing the y axis does that make sense to you there's no way to do that the only way you can do that and have a constant line is like this that's a horizontal so if you have a y equals that's saying you're going to have a y intercept at that number and it's going to be horizontal so when y equals a constant you're talking about a horizontal line what's the way I can make a vertical line just straight up yep if x equals a constant we have an X intercept that's a vertical line another way you can think about that if you have y equals and you try to fit it into this formula the slope intercept of point slope you've got a slope of zero right there there's no slope there slope of zero is going to give you a horizontal line if you don't have a y though that means you're going to have an undefined slope that means you're going to be a vertical oh yeah let's manipulate one equation we'll see if we can put it into a slope intercept form we'll talk about some parallel perpendicular lines and then we'll go on to some trigonometry I can tell you're excited you excited yeah some of you are giving me death books right now you know that right here we have an equation that's kind of a standard form of a line it it'd be standard form if we added the three to one side and then we'd have we'd add the standard form is there a way you can put this into slope intercept go ahead and try that for me just go ahead and solve for y and make that slope intercept and want to make sure you can do it what would you do first if you're trying to solve that thing for y isolate yeah you're trying to isolate it what's your first step in doing that here add three you could add three then you could subtract 4X and then you could divide by two another way to do it you could subtract 2 y right it's probably going to eliminate a step for you if you subtract 2 y you're going to end with 4x - 3 = -2 y now typically we don't like to do that because we don't want to have a negative coefficient in front of Y but we just have to divide by a negative and if you're good with signs you can do that pretty easily how do we get that y by itself again just make sure if you divide you got to do it everywhere and you have have the same exact thing and you have to be good with your signs so 4X over -2 what are you going to get out of that how much 2 and then plus or minus how much equals sure maybe you write that a little bit different to get that in the form as you want it Y = -2x + 3 could you still graph that and as a matter of fact sometimes it's nice to keep it in stand I asked you to do it in slope intercept form but I also want to show you this if you have this in standard form which would be that have you ever learned the coverup method for graphing from standard form you ever seen that before if you want to find the x intercept cover up your yide by four you know this is going to cross the x axis at 4/3 it's easier than graphing a a fraction than going up and over down and over if you want to find the Y intercept you cover up the X divide by this number positive2 that's going to cross the y- axis at positive 3 halves you can graph a line like that as well so just a little refresher on those those show hands how many people feel okay so far on on our lines you still all right you you awake still this should be review and this is review for you I know some of you are thinking where's the calculus just wait for it all right the calculus is going to come whether you want to or not uh just hang on for a second enjoy the the nice slow stuff but really absorb this if you're if you're a little rusty on it what do you know about parallel lines that's actually the definition did you hear them over there we have the same exact slope that means we have parallel lines it's kind of like climbing stairs right the way stairs work is they're parallel that means you're going up and over the same rate otherwise on these stairs over here if your if your stairs didn't go up and over you're going to be like this you like oh These are nice these These are nice son of a gun you know if they were different slopes you they intersect somewhere we don't want that to happen for stairs we don't want that to happen for parallel lines so when we talk about parallel lines what we're talking about are lines that have the same exact slope do perpendicular lines have the same slope no no no they don't actually perpendicular lines meet at a very specific angle what angle do perpendicular lines meet at right so if one Line's like this the other line's got to be like that right means if one slope's positive the other slope's negative so we know that's going to come into play also there's a it's not just a negative slope that's going to be something like this right that's not going to cross at 90° we want to make it actually just a little kicked over how do I make it so it meets exactly 90° it's not only negative but also AAL very good a couple of you said reciprocal so perpendicular lines are lines which have are lines where the slopes are negative reciprocals of each other okay I was basic question if I give you an equation can you find a line that's parallel and or perpendicular sorry or perpendicular to a given equation can you guys do that let's try that out real quick that'll be our our last little timid review problem hopefully these have been timid for you we haven't even made it 30 minutes in we hav't we're going to get to some train in just a bit Yeah so let me say that I want to find the equation of the line that passes through this point and parallel to this find the equation passing through a set point and parallel to a given equation what's the two things you need for sure in order to make the equation of a line slope and a what now Point new point do I have a point cool do I have a slope do I have a slope right now no not yet I got to work on it but could you find that slope let's find the slope go ahead and do that on your own real quick give about 5 seconds you actually should be pretty good at this is the slope -2 no what am I missing that's the reason we talk about slope intercept right it's to find that slope very easily your slope's -23 now what I'm asking for is the equation of line that's parallel to that line but now goes through that point so what slope am I going to use if I want to find the the parallel line to this I'm use three halves I want the parallel to this oh parallel lines have the same slope so what we're going to write down we're going to find our slope we want the parallel slope so we're going to write down the parallel slope if it's parallel it's going to be exactly the same we know that our m is going to be -23 now what point do we use what point do we use speak up what point do we use okay does this for have anything to do with this problem actually all we cared about was finding the slope once we have the slope and we already identified a point wow we can just plug that into our point slope formula find the equation of our line so we'll do y - 7 = -23 x - 6 quick quick show hands how many people feel okay solving for slope give me a head now if you understand that the slope we are supposed to use is still -2/3 because we want to find a parallel do you see where the six and the Seven are coming from good deal can you work that out and make that slope intercept for me okay let's do that together I know that y - 7 that's going to stay there on the right hand side tell me what I'm going to get and then plus or minus what do you think plus how much good final step if we add set four because we got 2/3 * 6 2/3 * 6 you can simplify the fractions or get 12/3 that's four add our seven to both sides and we're done what if I change the problem and instead of having parallel I asked you to do perpendicular could you still do it let's talk about the the only changes that would occur up here okay I'm not going to change the whole problem I just wanted to walk you through it here if I'm talking about perpendicular would this process change would this change what's that going to become okay so this would become three so here now we're talking about perpendicular would the seven and the six change no we're just talking about slop about this is parallel perpendicular only has to do with the slopes this would change to our 3es this would change to our 3 x it'd be minus how much - 9 and if we added seven to both sides here we get 3 x - 2 so we can find both the parallel and the perpendicular slope do you feel okay about our basic line so far would you like to learn a little bit about angles of inclination and use a little bit of Tri trigonometry here and you're like no not really too bad we can do it anyway let's talk about angles of inclination we're going to use it at some point are there any questions before I race any of this stuff are you sure are we having fun yet wouldn't you rather be in here than out there in the rain some of you like no I'd rather be in the rain honestly right now prer that just lie to me just lie and say yes this is awesome Leonard I love this class you're the best thanks guys appreciate it if you did that I would just watch this video over and over again and have you go thanks Leonard you're the best yeah thanks Leonard you're the best yeah thanks lard you're the best see I just have I do it with my workout thanks lard you're the best bam B bam so cool I know I'm the door oh my angle of inclination let's talk about how we can use angle of inclination and relate it to a slope we're going to start with some line random by what I talk about the angle of inclination what we talk about is the angle that any line makes with the x-axis so the angle of inclination the these actually would be the same angle if you taken geometry you know that those those are the same we're really just talking about this one though we call it f we want to find some way to represent this line as having that angle if we think about the X and the y axis notice noce that this we could represent as a change in X you guys have seen that that terminology before the Delta X Change in X and this would be well the change in y now think back to your trig days it's just basic trigonometry is there a trig function that that uh that relates this angle and these two specific sides remember this would be a 90° angle what does that what what's if this is a triangle which it is uh what's this side called that's hypotenuse what's this one according to this angle that's the good and this one is the which one relates adjacent and opposite tent not sign sign would be opposite over hypotenuse tangent does or coent we don't deal with cotangent Cent's adjacent over opposite we want to deal with probably the easy one tangent if we talk about tangent the tangent of that angle is equal to the opposite over the adjacent not your head if you're okay with the the tan opposite over adjacent if you're not you you're definitely going to want to review your trigonometry before attempting this class you're deal with a lot of trigonometry but here's the cool thing what what is what do we always already Define as as change in y over change in X or rise over run what do we always already Define that as so then we we have this relationship we know that tan Theta well that's Delta y Delta X but this is also the same thing as slope or M if you bring all this together slopes equal to 10 do you see the relationship between your slope and your angle of inclination it's same well it's the same as the tangent of that angle of inclination because Tan's defin is opposite over Jason and so is slope we can make that job what's kind of cool is it says that if you know the angle well you can find the slope can't you if you know the angle you can do that in a calculator you'll be able to find the slope if you know the slope you can find the angle those things are intertwined they're they're equal to each other along with that tangent so let's shall we try one would you like to see an example of how this is done would you you're the most mellow class I've ever had would you like to see one bring it up let's say that your angle is 30° someone quickly 30° as radians is what same thing as 5 six yeah I want you to find the slope of the line that has an angle of inclination of 30° or/ 6 here's how you do it we know for a fact that m equals tan Theta don't forget that okay that that's your equation that's what you do now you know that the slope is equal to the tangent of that angle what's our angle what's our angle 30 30° so if I plug in my 30° or I plug in my Pi 6 at the same angle okay if I plug that in there I know the slope I'm looking for is equal to the tangent of Pi 6 or 30° whatever you want to work in I like Pi 6 now all those with your your uh unit circle tattooed on your right arm okay look down there can you tell me what tangent of pi/ 6 is can you tell me what tangent remember tangent you have to define a sign over cosine right so you got to find s of 30° or S of Pi / 6 put it over cosine or have a memorized put it over cosine of Pi / 6 or 30 degrees look at you in a circle if you have one you should have one need one honestly you should tattooed on your forehead backwards that way you look in the mirror you can memorize it it's a good idea good I haven't done it personally but I'm waiting for someone to actually do that pretty classic tangent of pi over 6 is s over cosine the S of Pi / 6 um 12 cosine of pi 6 < tk3 over two that's what those correct me if I'm wrong but I think those are right yeah pretty sure I'm doing this on the spot good all right can you simplify that a little bit yeah those twos are actually going to cross out uh you you you know divide those fractions complex fractions you're going to flip that multiply the twos are going to be gone what you're going to end up with is 1 over the < TK 3 or if you rationalize the denominator you know how to rationalize denominators right multip byun3 ro3 you're going to get 3 < tk3 3 strangely enough that's your slope right there your slope is < tk3 all right uh let me recap did you get that that was funny let me recap oh come on stand up next time maybe you'll get it uh here's I I honestly will recap though here's what you do to find the slope if you have the angle of inclination you take your angle you plug it in and you figure out the tangent of that angle that's honestly it I mean if you can find the tangent of pi/ 6 you have your slope that that is your slope all right now can you go backwards that's going to be another question for us what if I said I have now room I have a slope of1 can I find the angle of inclination we we only have one equation the only thing that we know is that the slope equals tan Theta over here we knew the Theta right we were looking for the the the slope the M over here we know which one we know the m so notice we're using the same exact equation here we knew our angle you could have put 30° here very easily and done the same exact thing here we know our M we know1 equal tan thet how do we find Theta you could do tan inverse sure of both sides take it to the left we do tan inverse of1 equals if you do tan inverse of both sides uh it would look like this You' have tan inverse you'd have tan inverse tan inverse of tangent gone you have Theta tan inverse of1 that's what we have right here this is what the question asks you okay here's here's this in plain English it says I want you to tell me the angle so that when I take tangent of it it's going to give give me NE 1 that's what tan inverse says it's it's kind of a backwards way of of looking at it it's saying find me the angle that way when I take the tangent of it it's going to give me the value of negative 1 do you understand the question there it basically it goes down to look at the unit circle find out where s and cosine are the same but have different signs because you know tangent is s over cosine right so you look at your unit circle find out where it's um oh what we have it's two of them I don't remember the exact one but find find out where you have S and cosine exactly the same off by sign that will give you Nea 1 have you found do you have your unit circle out yeah 3 Pi that's exactly right oh yeah have right here so this happens where your s your cosine are the same but off by a sign that's uh < tk2 over 2 over < tk2 over2 that's where that happens on your unit circle so check that out later if you don't have your unit circle handy you're going to have that same exact value only this one's going to be negative that happens twice actually and if you're confused is well well wait a second don't I get two of these same values yeah you do but think about what you're actually doing you're trying to find the slope of a line that goes like that right it's going to cross two quadrants it's going to have the slope here and there one's going to be positive one's going to be a negative uh way of looking at an angle they're all the same though uh 3 Pi what you say 3 Pi 4 3 pi over 4 or or the negative version of that uh used as a reference angle um so here we go we got that negative 1 so we know that this happened when Theta was equal to 3i 4 or if you want to translate that that's uh 135° so either way we look at this we can find slopes from angles can find angles from slopes I'd say that this one's probably a little bit more trick some for you cuz you're going to actually have to do a little bit of work on it this you could probably just plug in a calculator if you memorize like the 0877 thing you know oh that's like three over two yay or whatever you did zoom up at me I memorize those I don't want to look them up uh but if you if you do this on a calculator it'll actually work out for you it probably won't give you the square root of three but you can figure that out here you're going to have to use a unit circle if they give you a slope you're going to have to find the angle to which s over cosine makes that value it's going to be some you might have two of them it's not going to matter that the same exact value of the angle choose either one of them it'll it'll work out the same but find the angle to which you're getting that value do you guys see that the process here I know I went very quickly through this do you see the process yeah or no how feel okay with with this so it take a little bit of work to get handy on that yeah probably probably a little bit more work to out um let's see one more thing I want to go over let's talk about the distance formula real quick it'll wrap up our very first section here are you sure there's no questions on angles of inclination anymore we got time so if I give you this on a test and I say I want you to find the slope if the angle is pi over 3 you do it could you do it if you had a unit circle oh okay that's question uh if I say the slope is 1/2 can you find tangent where the angle would give You2 could you do it with the unit circle okay practice that stuff that's what I'm looking for I a test we get I don't care sure to be honest with you this is very much review Stu uh what I'm trying to get you to get back familiar with the tangent s cosine secant cosecant cotangent ideas because we're going to move way past this we're going to be using this within some problems all right so this isn't going to be a problem this is going to be within some problems you get it it's kind of like factoring isn't everything in algebra you just use factoring in everything in algebra you you get the analogy so that that's kind of what what we're doing here we're going to use a lot of trigonometry in this class we're going be doing things called derivatives and integrals and all going to involve trig functions so you got to know the trig pretty well to be successful uh people say that you go to calculus to finally fail algebra and trigonometry you made it this far but it's not the calculus going to hold you back I promise it's going to be your algebra and it's going to be your trigonometry I guarantee it the calculus is actually quite easy uh it's those Concepts put together with Calculus and makes kind of hard so if you're good at algebra in trig you're can be fine absolutely fine you stick with this class okay shall we distance formula in about a minute and a half then we'll call it a day let's do distance formula we're going to do it the same way that we did our slope formula which is we're going to pick two random points X1 y1 and X2 Y2 only this time we're going to find the distance distance between them if we have the X1 y1 and X2 Y2 well we for sure know that's X1 and that's X2 and this is y1 and that's oh that's y 2 what we want to do now though is use something that relates this side this side and that side and that's a right triangle what relates to thatan Pythagorean theorem absolutely you're right if we call this our distance here's what we can say we know that this length is X2 - X1 by the same step stuff that we just did with slope formula we know that this distance is Y2 - y1 by the same stuff we just used on our slope formula this is the length this is the length from those corresponding points we want to find the distance if we do Pythagorean theorem we've got D2 equals what what's pagan theorem say sure yeah a s + b s = c s some of you know that or I prefer a leg squ plus a leg squ equal a hypoten Square because that that tells you what you're doing right so if we take a leg squared that's this and a leg squared that equals the hypoten squar I already have that here's my first leg that's the distance squared plus the second leg that's the distance squared can you guys see the Pythagorean theorem at work here you guys see the leg Square yeah this is this is one leg right I'm just squaring it here's another leg I'm just squaring it and that has to be by Pythagorean theorem equal to the hypotenuse squared so we got that the only thing we need to do now get rid of the square how do I get rid of the square yeah that just means the whole thing now we are going to omit the plus minus because well we can't have a negative distance that doesn't make any sense so we're just going to have the square root of this entire thing D equals by the way oh here's a good question for you see where you're at will this square root get rid of this square and that square no what do you think does it does it work that way across [Music] addition this multiplication sure addition no way no.0 can't do that and that's our distance formula you know what I'm not going to do an example for because it works really really really similarly to our slope formula would you be able to if I gave you two points would you be able to find me an X1 and a y1 and an X2 and a Y2 and plug them in and not mess the science up right you just Square this value you square that value you add them of course it's going to be positive right because you're squaring something squaring something and adding it just don't forget to take a square root uh you can either leave it in terms of a square root or approximated give me a decimal answer how many people feel pretty good about what we talked about today all right that's good m 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 0.2:  Introduction to Functions.
so we've just talked about lines we're going to be a little bit more General today we're going to talk about section 0.2 we're going to talk about functions now here's a deal anytime you have such as uh one variable depending on another one such as like y depends on X for for most of our functions where Y is dictated by what you you put in for x uh some independent variable X and some dependent variable y we can call that a function the only thing that you really need to have for a function is that every input has one output not two outputs other otherwise you don't have a function because you plug in a number and you don't would know where to go so when we say a function we mean some expression where each input determines exactly one unique output usually for inputs we we say those are like X's so typically that's uh an X so some expression where each input X has exactly one unique unique means doesn't happen again one unique output and we typically call those Y's for or f ofx um for for us you know we can represent functions a lot of ways though we can represent with tables graphs formulas uh one one time I was fishing and I caught four fish and because I'm a math dork I I made a table table of it because you don't do that is that not [Music] WR anyway uh here's one example of of a function very easy function here's my fishes I think that's that's fish uh fish caught and the number of pounds that they were so my first fish second fish third fish and I caught four that day first one was 3.2 lb not not bad next was 1.4 then 2.8 and then I caught a massive bass for 7 .3 that's a good day good day good day threw them all back them all back firstly let's define what the the inputs and outputs are for this particular well this would we're going to see if it's a function in just a second firstly my my inputs are well the the fish that I caught in this instance the outputs would be well their weights when I weighed them because the scale would be like my function right I put my first fish on there it' give me a weight put my second fish on there it' give me a weight uh now the question question is is it a function is it a function does each input does each fish have one specific weight yep yeah okay uh you know what I need to erase something right here one exactly one not unique but one output uh unique output would be a one to one function we're not there yet so when we say it has one output I mean that that I don't have fish number one weighed 3.2 lb and 4.7 lb cuz you'd say how much did your first fish weigh I'd say 3.8 or 4 3.2 or 4.7 would that make sense to you well no seriously how much your fish weigh uh 3.2 or 4.7 and you like that doesn't make any sense you're giving me two weights for the same fish does that make sense to you would that make sense if if you asked me that question how much did your first fish weigh and I said oh well either 3.2 or 4.7 he said aren't we talking about your first fish yes we are 3.2 4.7 you're like well if I'm having dinner with you tonight I need to know if I'm going to be be hungry of 3.2 lb or if I'm going to be satisfied 4.7 I go 3.2 4.7 it doesn't make any sense right you have to get I have to give you a specific weight for that one fish that's what a function does it says if you say fish number one you're talking about one specific weight okay uh maybe I should say the word specific output not not unique as one unique output we will be talking about one to one in just a little bit how about number two does number two give me give me out just one weight yeah it doesn't say 1.4 and then something else over here that would not be a function so this thing is a function any any fish that I have it has one specific weight that we're talking about if I did this would it still be a function yeah V yeah yeah it would be a function this we this fish four weighed 3.2 lbs not something else it doesn't matter that these things are the same that can happen uh let me give you for instance as far as a graph goes that right there has the same output at several different spots right that that would be some sort of an X squ it says if I'm at this point or this point I still have the same exact output that that's okay this is still a function we're going to talk about vertical line test too it's a function um it wouldn't be a one to one function it wouldn't pass a horizontal line test but it would be a function we can also talk about functions really we don't see fish caught normally we see some sort of function like this especially if you're doing any mathematical modeling you might see this where you have set of inputs our X's you got a set of output outputs that thing would be a function every one of our inputs or X's has one output how you would say that it wouldn't be a function if you came back and did something like this would that be a function no no if your inputs are repeated with different outputs well then you don't have a function there so that would be a no bu no sometimes we actually have formulas too that are are functions uh this is a function what is that by the way sure and it's a function because if you give me a radius it's going to give me out one area isn't it so our area depends on the radius you have for your circle it's not like I say you have a radius of three what's your area and you give me two different answers that wouldn't make any sense it wouldn't be a function the formula would fail also we can have some graphs graphically if we did something like that we can have we can represent them lots of different ways basic tables here formulas which we spend most of our time in formulas and graphs that's another way we represent functions um just one one note functions have to have only one output for each input that's that's the key thing I I hopefully you got that from from this now one more thing about this one let's say say we change it just a bit and we say y = FX could you find F of0 what would that mean to do I mean if Y is f ofx it says Y is a function of X and I'm asking for f of Z can you tell me what is f of0 in this case Okay is how much two because it says you go over to the input of zero you look up the output for that particular input so here it says find your input remember this is f ofx right so go to your X go to zero tangle with output is oh it's two how about F of three what's F of three everybody that wasn't everybody I'll take it fine whatever yeah it just says you go to your input of three you find out what that output was typically we'll use this in this type of situation where you have some sort of equation Y = 3x^ 2 - 4x + 2 the Y equals thing isn't always the best for us to represent a function the reason is it's because in this class we're going to look at a lot of different functions at once and you want to be able to distinguish between them if I have just y equals a function then y equals another function y equals another function I say look at the function y you're going to be like there there's three of them which one you talking about we often use this type of notation to distinguish between them so if I said instead of yals f sorry y equals that function I want F ofx or G of X or H ofx that way we can dis distinguish between those graphs and those formulas um and these equations also What it lets us do is if I ask you to plug in a number it will tell you inherently what number you plugged in for instance if I say uh for you here can you find me F of zero well what does f of zero do what's that supposed to do for you I'm supposed to plug in okay you're supposed to plug in zero and find out what the output is can you plug in zero here yeah two okay so you said two okay so you plug in zero zero yeah you get the two what's nice about this is if you plug in two from this one well you're going to get yals 2 but does this tell you what you plugged in to get the two no no does this this will tell you what you plugged in get the two yeah yeah this actually will give you a a coordinate point it will say you plugged in zero you got out two and that's kind of nice this is one other reason why we use that function notation let's go back to those graphs too uh can you tell what is a function just by looking at the graph so for instance for instance can you tell me whether these things are functions or not just by looking at them we know we can tell with tables right because if we have an input repeated with a different output that says it right there we're going to be able to tell formulaically in just a little bit but right here just by graphically what what's that thing called where you test a line to see whether or not it is a a function or not veral line yeah we have a vertical line test imagine bless you wow that was a powerful one it was like a sneeze grenade going off um sneeze grenade that would be so gross so disgusting that's where my mind is right now okay so if you imagine every vertical line it's supposed to touch your graph at only one spot if it touches it all so is this thing a function yeah for sure every vertical line hits this diagonal only one spot so yeah this is a function how about that one is that a function yeah parab are basically are basic functions every vertical line hits this is it a one: one function do you know that no one to one function would be the horizontal line test saying that every input has one unique output it says it doesn't happen again this is not one to one but it is certainly a function how about this one is this a function yeah sure now what about this is interesting case what about this one is this a function no does every vertical line hit the graph at at most once yeah yeah now a couple people get hung up because wait a second don't you have to have something at this point zero and the answer is no not every input has to have an output but if it does it only happens once do you see the difference there this doesn't have an output it's undefined zero this would be like 1 /x uh but if it is defined then that definition has to be one exact point to be a function so yeah this is still a function how about this one no this fails it because if you plug in this point you actually get one two three points out we can't deal with that so this is not a function so vertical line test verbally I'm not going to write it down because I know youall you all know it says that you imagine every possible vertical line uh that vertical lines have to touch every point of that graph at at most one spot so touch the graph at at most one spot it can't ever cross over more than one spot through how many people feel okay with our very quick introduction to function so far you having fun yet enjoy enjoy Joy well let's consider one more thing what is that Circle say louder circle circle did you all know it was a circle did you read the section on circles I I told you I said read circles right did you read circles hopefully you read Circle that's a circle what's it centered at center of the origin very good z0 the way you shi circles around hopefully remember this from your intermediate algebra days is you have some parentheses in here like x - h and y + K that would that would shift that around okay uh what's your radius good because we know this is the the radius squared so our radius would be five is it a function is it a function why not well yeah I mean visually we know it's a circle right that's circular reasoning isn't it get it thanks where's my drums um it's a circle so it's not going to pass the vertical line test that's one way we Define that if we actually graph this it's a center 0 0 radius of five it looks like this it's certainly not going to pass that vertical line test however can you see it formulaically as well specifically can you solve this for y and see that this is not a function let's try that how would you solve this for y your first okay so probably isolate the Y get the x^2 over there somehow you know you're going to get y^2 = 25 - X true now Y is not completely isolated what would we have to do to get y all by itself let's do that so if we take a square root of course that means both sides that's legal to do on the left hand side we get y on the right hand side tell me what I'm forgetting right here or oh yeah every time you take a square root of something you got to have a plus and minus so if the square Root's on your paper no big deal but if if it's not there and you put it on your paper like we did up here right we didn't start with that square root we in uh we introduced it to the problem when you do that you absolutely must have a plus or minus do you see the situation now I want you to try to plug in a number and tell me how many answers you get out how many outputs you get out how many you're going to get yeah because if you plug in something like I don't know four you're going to get 25 - 16 right right you're going to get N9 square of n n three but then you're going to take plus three and minus three that's giving you those two those two answers as soon as you have that out of a formula it's not a function now the question is could you work with it to look at parts of this function and that answer is yeah absolutely if we Define this a little bit differently if we say well let's call F ofx theun of 25 - x^2 and G of X the ne < TK of 25 - x^2 now let me say a question is this a function yeah sure is this a function yeah together they're not a function but separately well we could talk about each piece that'd be fine what would this be the top half or the bottom half of a circle top top half bottom half then we could talk about them uh but Al together when we look at that thing certainly we don't have a function there uh the other types of functions we need to talk about one of them is called peace wise functions before we go on to that are there any questions on for of the line test or what we're doing over here kind of just showing that all formulas aren't functions I mean we we don't have that necessity and when we solve them though we can talk about pieces of them as functions are you guys all with me on this so far you ready to talk about peace wise functions sure you sure sure all right here's what a peace wise function basically have you guys seen a peace wise function before okay I I know you have you supposed to have seen it is to be in this class you've seen it before uh one very basic PE wise function we're going to deal with for just a second uh the idea is though with PE wise in general that the formula depends on the value of x so the formula for the function depends on what value you're trying to plug in so PE wise functions work where the function changes depending on the value of x your input move over here some room the most simple one I can think of and this is really a really simple one that people introduce peace wise functions with it's one you deal with man you've been dealing with this probably since like seventh grade six seventh grade it's the absolute value function what's the the symbol for absolute value what do you do with that bars yeah those vertical lines okay so if I say the absolute value of x what is absolute value do the distance away from zero yeah that's right and and some other people you said what's it do like more applicably what do you do with that if I put a number in there I say uh absolute value of five what's absolute value of five okay and I say absolute value of -12 and you tell me it's 12 why it's a distance from zero we're counting over what does it do what does it do okay so make everything be more specific you actually have to say this in two parts right because one of them's already positive so what what does it do if the if the number is positive does it change it no okay if the number is negative does it change it so you tell me that this function does two different things depending on what value X is that's really what you're telling me right if x is positive I leave the number alone if x is negative well I change that sign somehow does that make sense so really we can Define this as a peie wise function if we say okay uh f ofx is absolute value of X2 it's really hard to think about that as as far as a graph goes I mean you might know what the graph looks like but how would you say you might have memorized that do you know what the the graph of absolute value of x looks like looks like a V yeah show me with your hands how it looks don't throw up gang signs that's I'm just kidding no it's yeah it's it's a v now why how can you get that from this you can't you have to either plug in numbers and figure it out or you have to Define it piecewise here's how a piecewise definition looks how that funny bracket that says all this stuff goes together and then we have to Define it on a piece by piece basis here's what the absolute value does it says you're going to do something if x is less than or sorry greater than or equal to zero you're going to do something else if x is less than Z some people Define it as strictly greater than strictly less than and then when x equals z itself we're going to Define it like this what do you do if X is bigger than zero do you have to change it at all now like this five right you didn't have to change the five you just pretty much dropped the absolute value so we leave the X alone if it's bigger than zero what do you do if x is less than zero you say what now X okay so we change a sign he said Negative X that's the when we could change it right if I did this and said how do I get from -12 to 12 what math did you do magic I I did I'm Harry Potter this my my wand I did Magic math negative gone right there all right Voldemort I'll show you who boss too much what this really says is you have to find some math way to change a sign the only math way we have to change a sign is either multiply by a negative or divide by a negative so absolute value of -2 really says follow this formula and says you take the negative of -12 does that give you back pos2 that's the peace wise definition right there that's it and works it works for anything you can follow these directions for your P wise function it will tell you which part to use now of course we know this one from a long time ago but can you see that this is the definition of that this would do it every time what's kind of cool is that any piece-wise function can be graphed by using their pieces so we're going to do that next you can graph any pie wise function by graphing each piece individually the only thing you have to be concerned about is that you use the appropriate range that's really it so we're going to tack on just a little bit you can graph each uh you can graph piecewise functions by graphing each piece individually but you you have to do it for the given range so we're not going to graph the whole line of f xal x we're going to just going to do it for for a little bit of it I'm going use that word domain let's give that a try so here's what we do with graphing pwi functions I'll write this out in a little bit for you when we get to a more advanced example uh but for right now basically what you do you ignore one of these functions one of these pieces you graph this whole thing and you erase it for the parts that it doesn't actually exist so what right now I want you to think of the the line FX = X how's that look what does f ofx x look like sure you can do it with slope uh intercept form what's the intercept this is in MX plus b form yes okay the plus b well that's zero so we know it's Crossing at at the origin what's the slope of that so it means it's going up one over one so if I were to graph this whole thing this right here is FX = X agreed the problem is is this right right now the whole thing where does it actually exist and the directions will tell you that where does it exist to the right of the y or to the left of the Y right don't all speak at once to the right of the y or left of the Y come on you got to be participating yeah that's because we're looking for the X's that are positive these X's are negative it's saying it doesn't exist over here so we'd erase that part that doesn't even make sense so right now we know this is the X where X is bigger than Z bigger than or equal to zero that's why we have this closed Circle there because of the equality that includes that little piece since we've graphed that piece already let's go down to the next piece negx just takes that makes a slope the different way same intercept since we know this already has the piece of a graph we can't put anything else otherwise it won't be a function we're going to leave it just like that that's where you get your your V from this is the f of x = x are you ready to try something just a little bit more advanced can we do that okay you guys have any questions on the absolute value you've all seen that before yes good let's see if we can can sketch something a little bit funner is funner a word I'm a math teacher it's this is funner I guess I should know words and stuff that's better are you ready we're going to graph this piece by piece now here's a little hint for you what you want to do break up the the the domain first your x-axis first and the appropriate ranges graph the pieces that'll work out for you so what I'm looking at first is where this starts and stops I'm looking at the key intervals here the key intervals are what's what's one point that I'm going to have on my graph where's the X start and stop Z zero is not up there don't care about the zero I care about the negative one because that's where we're going to trade off between one piece and and the next piece do you get what I'm saying I want to I want you to find the places where you're switching between fun one place is at NE one where's the other place sure here's what our directions say PE wise functions have directions it says for a certain range that's less than or equal to Nega 1 so everything over here I'm going to be doing something between these two numbers I'm going to be doing something else after this number I'm going to be doing something else that's what how PE wise functions work nod your head if you're okay with that now we just grab the pieces making sure we don't overlap these functions or these these inters what happens when the X's are less than or equal to -1 what are we doing for this range so we've already broken it up we're going to go piece by piece we're looking at this piece right now which of the directions has to do with this piece of information do is this this piece no this is bigger than one that's that's that's the wrong way is that this piece this is between negative 1 and one so we've got to be talking about this piece and if you look at it says X is less than or equal 1 so we know we're we're this way what do we have to graph for this this piece right here Z zero wow what's zero mean what's zero mean horizontal line good where y0 this which one this do you know have a lost you yis have lost you gu have a lost you hor like that it would have to be horizontal listen if if the the whole grouping of this kind of confuses you just write them out differently say that you have y = 0 for a certain bit say you have y = < TK 1 - x^2 for a certain bit say you have Y = X or a certain bit it's the same thing you're just grouping all these together in function and graphing them piece by piece do you see that okay so this is the piece that's working where your X is less 1 or equal to it this is the piece that's working when you're between1 and 1 and this is the piece that's working when you're greater than or equal to one split it up if you have to but you need to be able to graph each of those functions so can you all tell me now what does yal 0 look like the XIs that is the xaxis yeah that's a horizontal line at yal 0 y equals a constant right we talked about that last time it's a horizontal line so we're talking about this right there uh one question I have for you should I have an open circle or a closed Circle here and why CL Circle and Y good good very good okay check got let's go to the next piece the next piece Works between -1 and one now do do you also understand why why we might have to have no equal sign here and why if I did this it would not be a function be overlapping if these were were different yeah that's right so you're you're never going to see equals equals you're always for the same value you're not going to see that so let's go and see what what is that oh my gosh what is that do you recognize it we had it before on the board except the numbers were a little bit different what is that a circle if you squared both sides you get y^ squ over there wouldn't you if you added the X squ you get x^2 + y^2 = 1 that's a circle it's centered where do you think origin origin somebody else tell me what's the radius one mhm that's one guys if you have questions now and that would be a good time are you okay that this is a circle how many people feel okay that that's a circle you can see it if you can't see it don't reach your hand can't see it don't raise your hand can you see it not so much if you can't see it if you're like oh my gosh what in the world is that square both sides you get y^2 = 1 - x^2 if you add the X2 you get x^2 + y^2 = 1 now this isn't we cheated a little bit we cheated because this is not an entire circle an entire circle would be be that you clear that would give the top half and the bottom half what are we talking about the top half or the bottom half which one top we're just the top half right now so we want the top half of a circle the top half of a circle centered at 0 0 with a radius of one well that looks to me like it's going from here to there it's going to have an open circle right here but it's been closed in by the previous function that's kind of cool right we don't have an over leing point is it going to have an open circle or closed Circle here open yeah again why why is it open it's not equal mhm doesn't have that little that little equals so we've got our first piece we got y equals 0 we got our second piece the top half of the Circle Center 0 0 radius one the last piece oh the last piece y = x how we going do that yal X what's yals X look like it's a it's a line that goes through the origin okay okay so so normally we would just have a diagonal line Yeah we actually already to graph that it's right here so if we were to graph that we'd have this thing it' be through the origin it would it would go through the point one one wouldn't it because when you pluged in one you get out one so I know that it's going to go through that point and in fact it's going to be solid because there's an equals there so if I were to graph it it would be that diagonal however I can't have it exist I can't have it exist over here because then this whole thing wouldn't be a function we're talking about just the piece that's that way so I'm going to extend that line erase this piece because I can't have it there I've already got my piece of the function for that part that r that interval this is a the interval we're looking for that's the piece of the function is that kind of cool looking I think are you able to understand it can you follow help me feel okay about that one good so piecewise uh delineate your I use that word again uh delineate that x-axis by the appropriate intervals graph each piece and you got down oh cool the last thing we're going to talk about for this section we're going to talk about domain and range more about domain than range hey when I say domain to you what do I mean if I talking about the domain X more more more General than just x what if I'm using different variables what is do someone over here what does domain mean input yeah the inputs yeah you're absolutely right so when I'm talking about domain what would mean is all the values you can input into a function and yeah you're right there usually X's typically unless you're dealing with like a position function then you're talking about time has time if domain means all the inputs what does the range mean these are usually your y values or your F ofx or whatever function you're dealing with now most cases we have some sort of constraint in real life especially we have some sort of constraint on the domain let me give you a couple examples on this uh let's say that that I give you an example here the area of a square the area of a square now the domain is all the lengths of the sides of the square that you could plug into this this function and get out an appropriate area can you tell me if there's any problems with numbers I plug in here for instance does s have to be is s restricted in any way if we're talking about an actual Square here oh sides do have to be the same but I'm talking about can't be negative why can't it be negative because in real life there is no negative sure in the formula you could plug in3 couldn't you it's going to give you n but in real life can you draw me a square right now with the side length of3 can you do it draw me neg3 oh you can't do it right you're not going to make a square that has when you measure on takee measure it gives you ne3 that doesn't happen because we don't measure uh actual distances and units of length and negatives so we'd say here yeah the area of a area of square is S2 but we have a restriction the side length has to be greater than or equal to zero you could have a tri trial a trivial area trivial Square here it is that's it has zero area okay no no length of the sides you get have a zero length but you can't have a negative that's impossible we also could have some formulaic restraints like that one like that one y = 1X is there any number I can't plug into that sure why not yeah because your teacher the first time they showed you a fraction say now what number came you divide by and you're like zero I'm like oh good job Little Johnny you got it right never told you why right but you can't divide by zero any other number is going to work positive negative you're fine but not zero how about this one FX equal the square root of x here we couldn't have xal 0 can I have x equals 0 there can you plug in zero to a square root yeah well let me ask you what's the square root of zero then you can do it what can't you plug into square roots yeah not inside so we'd say sure this has a restraint where X it could be equal to zero but it can't be less than zero it can't be negative otherwise we well in the real numbers at least now let me make a little little statement there if you're talking about complex numbers can you do itag sure yeah you have an I but if we're talking about complex number I'm sorry real numbers and graphing them on a a real number system well we can't we can't do that now what we what we know is that we're going to redefine domain just a little bit I don't know if your book does this or not but how we Define do we're going to define domain a special way in this class called the natural domain the natural domain is basically everything that works in the in the formula including the maybe natural restraints of the of the problem like the side length of the square or the formulaic restraints of like a square root or dividing by zero so natural domain basically means everything that works in your formula or your function all values that work in the formula would you guys like to do some examples of finding natural domain or domain in general I was hoping you'd say yes natural domain ask this question it says are there any problems with plugging in numbers basically so let's look at a real simple one we got f ofx = x Cub it asks is there anything that you can't plug in that you can't input into that can you think of anything can you plug in positives can you plug in zero yeah can you plug in negatives are there any problems you can think of can you plug in fractions yeah sure you can plug anything you want if you can plug in anything you want and there's no problems what we do is we say domain is simply all real numbers all real numbers for those of you who like to be very symbolic you can do it differently uh you can say X is an element of the real numbers that's another way you can say it so there's no problems there that says that you can plug in any number within the real numbers and you'll be just fine how about that one can I plug in any number I want to this problem and get something out of it that's reasonable that's defined okay uh can I plug in zero yeah yeah even though you know we can't have zero in the denominator if I plug it in well I'm not getting zero in the denominator what numbers can't I plug in sure now you're doing this in your head but I want to show you here's how you find domain in general you look for situations where you could have problems those situations are Roots square roots specifically maybe fourth roots and denominators to find out what your domain is really here's what you're doing in your head you're saying I want to make sure that I know that if this denominator is equal to zero I've got a problem here now the zero product property is going to come up with your answers it says I know x -1 could possibly equal Z and give me a problem I know that x - 3 could possibly equal Z and give me a problem if I solve those I'm going to get your answers of one and three mathematically that's what you're doing right here do you guys see see what you're doing you're you're saying I can't plug in one I can't plug in three because if I do bam it's going to give me zero and even if I multiply by something it's still going to give me zero and I know I can't have zero on the denominator of any fraction so by setting a denominator equal to zero or not equal to zero is how I used to teach in in some other classes you can do this too I know it can't be equal to zero therefore that can't be zero that can't be zero and these two things I cannot have x equal to zero that's another way you can do it by setting that equal to zero solving it down you find out your problems within your domain for denominators so here we'd say x is all real numbers except or but X does not equal 1 and X does not equal 3 please don't ignore that does not equal okay because if you do this I know I I just use the equal sign that's what a lot of you have been practicing doing for your math careers but if you do this except xal 1 and 3 that says one does work do you see that we have to have the not equal to so once you find those problem numbers put the not equal to we're going to find out later that what these things are if you cannot simplify them out of your function those are going to be asmp tootes vertical asmp tootes so this is not going to be defined at x 1 it's not going to be defined at x 3 those are either going to go up like that looks like I'm doing my dance moves but that's so they're doing they're going to go up at an Infinity down Infinity something like that do you guys feel okay with this particular domain let's try a couple more I want to get through a few more problems here um okay how about this one how about Tan x t x is that defined everywhere s goes like this right and cosine goes like this does tangent go like this how's tangent go it makes those those kind of weird s's of the snakes all the way down your paper why does it do that why does it do that wasn't wasn't uh rhetorical why does it do that sure it's undefined why why is it undefined at certain points skipping the X you remember how I just told you how functions aren't defined if they have denominators where those denominators equal zero we'll check it out if we if we looked at this this is tangent right if we set this denominator I I'm going to use the not equal to zero because we know we should not have that equal to zero if cosine X can't be equal to zero which is what I'm saying here what vales of cosine make it equal to zero where do in terms of radians pi two is one of them so X can't equal that's why I'm using this right here x can't equal Pi 2 x can't equal if you keep on going you're going to get let's see for you guys here's Pi / 2 cosine Z true you're going to keep going to 3un / 2 if you keep going around the unit circle you're going to get a lot of different values it's going to keep repeating both backwards and forwards every PI from that so Pi / 2 plus or minus U Pi K Pi where where K can be positive or negative integer it's going to give every part where tangent is not defined because cosine will be zero at those points do you see why this this works the way it does you see why the tangent is not defined at those simply because cosine is not defined at those points you guys see that kind of neat right doesn't matter if the numerator is equal to zero S zero over something that's defined that's okay but something over zero that's not okay okay last one we're going to talk about and then we'll call it a day do I have any denominators here any denominators anything over anything no I'm good as far as that goes but man I got a square root so we're going to be having some trouble doing this square root what do you know about things the radican that's what's inside the radical what do you know about the radican of square roots they have to be they got to be positive so when you're dealing with these roots denominators I showed you how to do that what you're going to do is set the denominator equal to zero or not equal to zero solve that down that will give you your problems in natural domain uh as far as the radicals go you know for a fact that this thing is going to have to be bigger than or equal to zero you know we're going to start this next time I'll show you how to do that all right so we're going to continue finding some domains and some ranges of some functions now now basically when you're finding what I said was the natural domain that's just really what works in a function what we got to do is look for our problem areas if we can Define our problem areas that really defines what we can plug in and specifically what we can't plug into a function really what that comes down to for us is you're always looking for denominators and Roots if you have denominators you know that at some points you might be undefined if you have some Roots there might be some ranges of numbers that you can't even plug into your function so with us up here we're going to have an issue inside that root what do you know about square roots I think we might have talked about this last time what do you know about those what numbers can't you have in there now can you plug in a negative here yeah you might be able to provided that when you work it through the the radican the inside of your radical it's positive that'd be fine really what we want with any root with any square root we want the inside part the radicand to be greater than it could it be equal to zero is that okay to have a root with a zero inside of it sure so so really we want this if you remember from last time we had some denominators what we did was we set our whole denominator equal to zero or I even use the not equal to zero because it can't be zero and you can solve it that way with the equal to zero finding out your problems with our Roots what we're going to do is make the inside greater than or equal to zero we're going to find out those ranges that work oh my gosh that's a quadratic inequality that's math C that's Intermediate Algebra days for you how do you do that what would you do in order to solve that problem Factor we would definitely have to factor at least you probably can see that because it's a quadratic right go ahead and factor that see what you get let's see I think so- 3 -2 do you all get that too okay we pass Factory scar if we didn't my gosh all right how do we do the rest of it though set it equal Z if we set each one equal zero you know what it's going to tell us it's going to say that X is greater than or equal to 3 and it's going to say that uh X is greater than or equal to two do you guys see that which actually is not going to be the right thing for us I know you want to right because you're so ingrained in saying make this equal zero make this equal Zer by the zero product property however we don't have the zero product property because that's not an equation that's an inequality if you know how to deal with your inequality here's what you do you do find the places where X would equal Zer you kind of temporarily set it equal to zero in your head you find those points hopefully in your head right now are the points xal 2 and xal 3 do you guys see those points here's what you do with this this is called a basic version of a sign analysis test so we know that x = 3 and x = 2 are some important points for us here's what you do with those points I want you to make up a number line put those points in order on your number line so which one's going to come first Forest going from left or right sure this is basically a graphic representation of of your interval what's going to work in your your function here so notice what we've done we've said okay we know the inside it's got to be bigger than or equal to zero we factored it we have some key points here we've got x = 3 x = 2 we put them on a number line now here's how to determine when you're going to be okay in your function when you're not if you test a point for each of these intervals how many intervals do we have yeah it's like you're slicing bread right if you have a loaf of bread and you cut it once you get two intervals if you cut it twice you get three intervals so you get three pieces of rad here we have our three intervals if you test each of those intervals with a point in your expression here it's going to tell you whether it's positive or negative that's going to tell you what you can plug into your function and what you can so let's try this can you and you'll see what I mean after we plugg in our first point can you tell me what is a point uh to the left of two zero zero that's the easiest one to plug in I want you right now to test zero so we're going to test zero test zero on the inside of my function if you plug in zero how much are you going to get six wait positive 6 or negative 6 so would you say that we came up with a positive answer yeah so this is going to be a plus what that signifies is that every number try it if you want every number to the left of two is going to give you a positive answer are you with me on that every if you tried one go for it you can try you tried a Nega any negative number that's going to give you a positive POS there do you believe me if you don't well just sprend the rest of your life try out numbers and then you'll come back to me I believe you when you're like 8 years old and I'm dead put on my EP letter or something so we've tested every number over here we know that every one of them is going to be a positive the reason why we know this if you think about it it's a quadratic right and you've just found the roots right it's actually upward facing quadratic so it goes like this positive positive positive dips down at two negative negative negative comes back up at three positive positive positive that's we're finding out right now we want the sections that are positive because we know we can only plug in positives or sorry get out positives for a square root that's the idea that's what a sign analysis test will do for you uh how about a point that's greater than three what are you going to try five five or or four try try five or four the only points you really can't try are two and three why what are two and three going to give you yeah that's not going to tell you anything right that's not positive or negative try try four right now on your own plug that in see what you get you can do it in your head if you want I don't really care about the actual value all I'm really concerned about is whether you're getting a positive or negative what' you get yeah you really you should this is a quadratic it should alternate so you tested four and you got a plus can you give me a point between two and three cuz we got to test a point in there too just to make sure we have this right 2 and two and a half great try two and A2 use your calculator if you want bet your million dollars is going to be negative you want to take the bet no it's quadratic right it's positive here it's positive here it's got to be negative there if it crosses the x-axis so it's going to be a negative how many people feel okay with what we've done so far so can you just set this equal to Z and this equal to Z and get it right and the answer is no no you can't because if you did this watch if you did x - 3 is greater than or equal to Zer and you did x - 2 is greater than or equal to Z you're going to get X is greater than equal to 3 that's true but you're going to get X is greater than sorry greater than equal 2 two that's wrong it's not greater than or equal to two it's actually less than do you see on our on our graph this tells you the areas that work right it says I can plug in any point over here and it's going to be okay because it's going to give me a positive and positives are okay inside of square root some of you're zoning out you can't zone out right now this says every number I plug in over here that's okay because it's a positive it's going to get this is the inside's going to give me out a positive and square roots of positives are okay these numbers aren't so good why aren't these numbers good when I plug them in the inside part becomes negative you follow if we have a square root of a negative well that's not so good for real numbers we can't have that defined so what this does it says your domain is all the intervals that actually work and this is how you can do all of your roots if you have a a function with a root and you're asked to find domain well you do this you set it greater than or equal to zero and you work it out sometimes you might have to do the quadratic with a a basic sign analysis but this tells you those intervals that actually do work so take those those ones that you know of and write them in interval notation can you tell me where this interval starts good and where does it end so Infinity all the way up to two now I know that's got to be a parenthesis because Infinities always have parenthesis is this a parenthesis or is this a bracket why is it a bracket because it's equal to good it's equal to zero because if I plugged in the two it would give me out zero right and that's that's okay for us and then to show any other interval what you do is you put this U standing for a union I know the three is going to work all the way up to positive Infinity that's a different way and your book likes to do this a different way to define your domain instead of all real numbers except you use the intervals that you can actually show so on your book sometimes instead of saying all real numbers like I showed you last time they say things like negative Infinity to positive Infinity you have you seen that yet have you look through your book that just means everything everything from the far left to the far right you guys ready to try another one did this make sense to you okay cool okay let's go ahead and try to find the natural domain for this what you ask yourself for domain is am I going to have any issues or basically do I have one of these situations do I have denominators that could possibly equal zero or do I have any Roots do we have any Roots here no we don't have any Roots that's kind of nice we don't have to do this whole mess mess of crap right we do have what though what's going to be a problem for usat we got a denominator how we how we deal with denominators domain issues with denominators is we set them equal to if you want to set equal or not equal to we know that the x - 2 can't equal zero if we do we're going to get something that's undefined so right here the way it is I know that x - 2 can't equal zero which means X can't equal which which number yeah that's problem so our domain would be all real numbers except X cannot equal two you'd have all real numbers but X can equal two that's that's the deal now I want to show you something this is going to come come back later in our class when we deal with continuity check this out true yeah difference of squares true yes you can do that they're factors true can you plug anything into that if there's no roots and there's no denominators then yes you can can you plug anything into that but wait a second this came from a function that we knew had a problem didn't it we knew we could not plug in two there so what's it mean that I can cancel out the problem can you actually cancel out a domain problem no well that doesn't seem right and the answer is no you can't so even if you can listen carefully even if you can simplify your your function which you can here you still have to keep the original domain otherwise you'd be eliminating some of those problems that you know exist did you follow that I say one more time if you can simplify your function do it but you have to keep the original domain because by manipulating your function on this particular case you've actually eliminated one of your domain problems which that that's not right you have to keep that original domain this says you can't plug in two right just by manipulating it you can't all like say hey no I can Harry Potter here's my math one done you can't do that so if you're going to do this this simplification just make a little note that with simplification you've got to keep your original domain so our our our our domain stays the same X still cannot equal two so for simplification keep your original domain with simplification keep the original domain I'll say it to you another way and this is how I always like to think of it you can't ever make your domain better by combining or simplifying functions you can't ever eliminate problems all you can do is make more problems so how your functions start those are the problems you're dealt that's a hand you're dealt okay if you add or subtract function together compose them uh the only thing you can do is create more problems you can't eliminate problems what you start with is what you start with so if you have a domain with right here with this function that's the domain unless you mess it up even more okay you can't ever make it better by allowing more points does that make sense to you now would you like to see what this actually is you want to see what this does the answer's always yeah yeah okay good I hope so can you graph this can you graph this in your head actually the answer is yeah these are the same graph check it out this graph right here is well that's a y intercept of two yeah what's the slope that means you go up one over one this is x+2 this is the graph of x plus2 with no domain restrictions it would say if I was just given this function and I didn't know about this that's how I graph it now what this function is what this one is with your domain issue it says that you shouldn't be able to plug in the two right if you were able to plug in two how much would you get out of it plug in two how much do you get out of it okay so what happens what this says is that when I plug in two I should be getting out four however I know for a fact from my original function I can't plug in because that would create an undefined situation in My Graph you with me don't zone out you with me still so it says you can't plug in two what that means here is if you can't plug in two you can't get out four that means you have a hole and that's what those are that what that is called in the future is called a removable discontinuity it's not continuous because you have to pick your pencil off the paper so it's not continuous however it's a removable discontinuity which is defined as if you allow one single point to fill that hole if you can fill the hole with one single point it's removable uh so that's that's what we consider that as so what are situations in your denominator there they're two categories I'll say them verbally but I'll go over them more in depth later if you can cancel out you know you love the use those words cancel out it's really not a mathy word but if you can cancel out your domain problem it's a hole you with me it's a hole if you can't cancel out the domain problem it's an ASM toote those are your two categories that makes it kind of simple to if you can cancel out it's a ho if you can't cancel out it's an ASM toote that's it you me write that down for you yes hoping I get away let me give you another example before you you write that down I'll give you the same one over here and I'll give you this one what can't x equal here yeah that's pretty I gave you a very easy one just so you can see of course X can't equal 4 here's the difference can you manipulate this way to manipulate this to get rid of the x- 2 okay if you cross it out that means you have a z over zero if you were to plug in the two check it out you're going to get 0 over Z right you see that when that happens that means you can cancel it out you can simplify it out of the problem that's a whole for you so when you get zero Z this is a hole like that when you can remove the discontinuity AKA when when you can cancel it out of your problem you always get Z over zero if it's a whole yes okay so as a test inad add whatever number you're not supposed to use and it comes to zero with pols absolutely okay radicals it'd be very hard to factor that out maybe I don't know I to do some work on that I'll get back to you on that one with polinomial is absolutely though because if you plug in a number and it is a zero that's automatically a root which means you can factor xus that number out of your equation and that's math that's that's proven so when you can remove the discontinuity we even talked about continuity before but when you can remove the domain this means domain problem that's a ho that's a hole zero over zero for pols in general when you can just when you can simplify it out of your problem and it's no longer a problem for your domain that's what we call a hole it's just a little spot where you don't have a point now your Happ you're okay with the idea of a hole okay now now the other the other thing we got to consider is well what what happens here can you simplify the x - 4 out of your problem here is there any way to factor it and simplify it if you plug in the four do you get 0 over Z no no you get well you get 12 over zero and that's that's an issue right that means that you're you're not going to be able to factor that in any way to be able to simplify that what this is is a vertical ASM toote vertical ASM toote this happens when you have a number over zero typically and it means you can't get rid of the domain issue I also say one more thing but I forgot it those are going to come much later I'll show you an easy way to do this we going talk about something called limits all right does this outline it better for you so you're going to have two classifications main issues if you can simplify them out they're called holes if you can't they're going to be vertical ASM tootes um we're going to find out a little bit later on how to determine what happens with those we'll do another sign analysis test with four on our number line we'll figure out that these ASM tootes can either go upwards or downwards or a combination of those two things so they'll they'll either be like this going towards four in this case or like this going towards four or like this takes a lot of practice to do that by the way it's kind of like uh rubbing your belly and patting your head it's hard to do can you do that let's see no I'm just kid camera's not on you guys I don't care okay now let's do one more example we'll go on uh two more examples we go on to a word problem kind of figure out how we can talk about domain with word problems and then we'll continue on to some uh trig stuff so I want us to find the domain Main and the range of this problem find domain and range to that problem hey first thing are we going to potentially have any problems in this any problem what what I'm asking you is basically are there denominators or are there roots are there any of those two things Ro uh there's definitely Roots so we potentially could have some problems we don't have any denominator so we're not dealing with holes and vertical ASM tootes what we're dealing with is areas of our graph that we can't even plug in a number because it's undefined in the real number system do you see the difference there it's not even defined in those those areas now what do you know about the roots how do we how do we go ahead and and find those areas set them they could be equal to zero right inside or less than zero or greater than zero have to be greater than zero so what we know is that the two is this okay they doing anything the only problem we potentially could have is the inside of this route because we know if this thing is negative that's not so good you okay with that not so good so we know that whatever we do whatever we plug in this has to be greater than or equal to zero that's a must otherwise we come into a a serious problem where we're not in the real number system anymore can you solve that how would you solve that folks what would you do add what one add one this isn't even one of those quadratic inequalities this is actually pretty straightforward one this says you're going to be okay provided X is bigger than or equal to 1 so for our domain you can say one of two ways you can say okay the domain is X is bigger than or equal to one or if you want to use the interval notation which again you're going to see a lot of answers like that in the back of the book um if you use interval notation it would say you're going from where to where infity negative Infinity 1 now that would be X would be less than or equal to one we want to be bigger than one to Infinity sure I know parenthesis here parentheses or bracket here sure yeah very good do you have any preference on which way write the answer I don't care uh you're going to see this a lot right now so you may as well do that uh when could you not have it equal to zero inside a square root I'm going to change the problem just just slightly so you see it if I erasee that and put it over one something or or four any number on on the top uh this would be the only case for for your roots when when you wouldn't have this equal to zero you see if if you actually plug that in if you plug in your one sure you're going to get zero but the square root of zero is z and it's on the denominator so this would say oh wait yeah even though that's a square root I can't have it equal to zero because if I did the square root of Z is still zero and that's on the denominator of my Frac see the the problem there FR that's you now how do you find the range what's the how do you get range how do you get something in the range it's it's an output it is an output so what wow that was that was a sneeze grenade oh my that was is a sneeze rocket launcher I'm allergic to this stuff allergic to calculus me too I start getting all amped up and excited uh anyway what are my inputs up here what can you input give me an example that you can input you can input one give me some something else three three someone else give me something any real number bigger than or equal to one yes that's everything I can plug in now now this says what you can get out right says plug in something you'll get out something so start with the first number you can plug in and plug it in if you plug what's the first number you can plug in plug in one what are you going to get out you're going to get out what two two so this is starting with two now take another number any number plug it in and see which way you're going higher or lower so pick a number in this domain again like three or four or five see which way you're going where where you going pick out pick two what's two going to give you or pick something easier than two Pick 10 I don't care what you pick pick five pick something like that pick five okay what's five going to give you four ah there you go are we getting bigger or smaller than this so we know that this is going to as I plug in bigger and bigger numbers towards Infinity this is getting bigger and bigger towards Infinity so my range goes from two to Infinity so how do you find range well you plug in your domain with limits we're going to find out how to do range a little bit differently but right now you plug in your domain you still feel okay so far y yeah yes yes yes indeed indeed all right so let's try one more we'll go on to our super fun word problem are you guys familiar with odd and even functions oh boy okay we'll talk about two more things then refreshment yeah refresh we want domain and we want range first things first let's talk about your domain are there going to be any issues with our domain here anything things that we can't plug in one what about negative one is that okay we'll get 0 over -2 is that all right to have sure zero over a number that's fine that's zero but something over zero that's not okay so for our domain we go okay I know that x -1 can't equal Z so X cannot equal one well that that's that's pretty clear so the remain is all real numbers except X can equal 1 now the question I have for you is is that thing a hole or is that thing an ASM toote what do you think if you don't know here's how you check you plug in the number that you're not supposed to be able to plug in it's like one if it gives you 0 over zero that means you can Factor it out if they're polinomial and simplify it out of the the problem if it doesn't give you that then you can't do that you can't Factor out so plug it in you get 2 over Z is that a whole or an ASM toote definitely an ASM toote so we know we're going to have a vertical asmt at that point you can't really abbreviate ASM toote more than that you don't want to vert ass so that' be just weird anyway uh how about the range how about the range of this thing that's kind of tough right you you don't know what the range is well there is one thing you can do uh on certain occasions this isn't always possible on certain certain things if you can solve it for your X variable then look at those domain problems for your y that's actually the range it's kind of like you're flipping the script in the problem so you can find the range by solving for the independent variable that's going to and then looking at those problems so if we were to do that JZ I don't even know if I want to do that I don't really want to I guess I will you can do it I can't well I know I can such confidence been doing this a while you were in Math League College I made fun of a keep Math League in college actually it's a horrible person Math League is cool do math League it's it's fun I swear it really is I was just I was too busy with other things to do that um anyway do you have problems here answer's yes same oh yeah it is the same that's just it's kind of weird that that worked out exactly the same I did this right trust me you you can follow it down this is correct but now that we solve for x if you find the domain for your y's that's actually the range of your function do you see the it's kind of cool right you say well if we have any problems on our y's that means we have problems in our range now well we're going to get out of the function what's the problem what can't you get out one one what's the what's the problem here what what can't you get out of this you can't get out one because y couldn't equal one do you see how y can't equal one here yes or no okay so if you do this whole idea of back or and you you you solve this for your independent variable and you make it so you're kind of like you're finding the domain of your dependent variable your y here that's going to give you your range so our range would say well now y I know y cannot equal one can you simplify out this domain issue which is actually a range issue can you simplify out that then this is a Asm toote as well only it's not a vertical ASM toote what is it it's a hor Asm now we're going to have a better way to find horizontal ASM tootes in the future because if you haven't noticed this process for here this was really easy but for every function can you always solve it for your your independent variable not even close no no no that'd be ridiculous uh so we're going to have a better way to do that in the future but for right now that's how you can find your domain and your range how people feel okay with what we talked about so far all right you ready for word problem no answer is always yes yes you ready for a super fun word problem then sure why not not come on you know you're not getting out of it anyway so you may as well enjoy it wait do that exist on the word problem yes it exists I'll prove it to you right now uh it exists just brought it there it is look at that here's what we're in the business of we're in the business of making cardboard boxes what we're going to do is we're going to take a cardboard box and make it by doing this taking your flat piece of cardboard and we're going to cut out a square here here here and here and fold up the sides will that work to make a box we'll use some tape around the sides and be good- looking box so very cheap way to make a box so our our box idea is we're going to take a piece of cardboard that is 16 in by 30 in and we're going to make a box by cutting out squares in the corners and folding up the sides tell me what you know about the squares same can the squares be different sizes you have a really stupid looking box I me you're like yeah that's not going to that's not going to work so well so if these aren't the same lengths all the way around you're not going to be able to make your actual fold flat like shirt box right that that people like to use for presents so I know if I call this x to in order to make my nice Corner that's also got to be X right yeah but as soon as we do that every other corner has to be exactly the same otherwise our box is going to really not be that great and you're going to get fired from box making how bad do you have to be to get fired from box making I mean come on no I'm just kidding uh I I'm guessing you you have to be pretty bad so we got this piece of cardboard is 16 by 30 in we're going to cut out those Corners so we get this machine that's going to come down and maybe it it it uh indents it here here here and here and we're just going to fold those sides up and and crease them I think they actually do is they probably just make one cut and then fold the sides over but you know we're a little more advanced than that so our box when we're all said and done let's see if I can draw this should look something like this you took a 3D drop in class it's amazing oh no that should be never mind y I was you guys are ging way too much credit uh so if I'm folding this up it's still sitting the same way it's going to be on on this Edge is this still 16 in long cuz what I want to do is I want to find a formula for the volume dependent on X I want to find a formula for the volume depending on the size of the cut we're making in in this uh this cardboard so find the volume as a fun function of X how far is that is it still 16 in how much is it 16 - 16 - x yes 2 why 2x you have to do Each corner yeah if we cut both corners and fold that up we're missing not only one X but the other X as well so if I were to find this yes I know the maximum length is 16 right and if I subtract both those those cuts I'm going to get 16 - 2x absolutely what that means is how about this length what's that length sure we still have the same X right because they're squares so we're going to have 30 minus 2x what about the depth of our box how much is the depth of our box the depth is X okay how do you find the volume of a rectangular pris like like this is say what now makes sense so as long as we multiply those three dimensions we'll have the volume so our volume should be okay well we know that one side is 16 - 2x the 2x again comes from the fact that we're cutting out two boxes from each side or a box from each side and folding it up then we're going to get well the the length of this is 30 - 2x and the depth of this is X do you guys feel okay on on how to do that by the way if you graphed that could you find out an approximate maximum volume if you put that on your graphing calculator yeah if if you did if if you worked all that out and plug that into your gra or just plug in just like that you're going to get some sort of graph right it happens to be a cubic graph so if you found the maximum height for the for our domain that we're about to find out you could find an approximate maximum volume for that that's kind of neat right I think it's neat is awesome let's talk a little bit though about the domain are there any issues that we are going to run into with the values of X that we're supposed to plug in so firstly we got to check for any denominators are there any denominators okay that that's okay that that doesn't fail that part how about uh Roots do we have any Roots so we have no issues with that how about some realistic constraints though is there anything that I'm not supposed to be able to plug in for X CU I tell you when you put that a graphic calculator it's going to go negative measur what now negative measurement explain why why not a negative measurement you can't measure netive cim yeah I can't tell you would you make a box up please and uh put -2 in cut in it bigger it's imaginary can you do that yes it's not going to hold very much right be flat like here well yeah you can't even do it you can't say make a negative cut out of my piece of paper here that doesn't make sense so we know for a fact that X is got to be greater than zero for sure could x equal zero but could it equal zero could you make no cut yeah here's your box okay that try to put a package in that yeah it could it could equal zero for sure is there a maximum cut that we can make for our box so I know I can't make a negative but I could make a cut of 1 in and 2 in is there a maximum to that nothing bigger than 16 16 okay 16 could I make a cut of 16 no why not because I cut off your side would that make a difference yes okay let's let's also I want you to think about that that number for a second so here's your box right and what you're telling me right now is if you have a maximum cut of 16 check this out this side length is 16 right you're cutting out two squares one from the top and one from the bottom can I cut out a square of 16 and still cut out a square of 16 remember this would be like a square of two four and four would go there if I take a square of 16 it's the whole thing that doesn't leave any room for the other Square to be cut out of it do you get that that's a problem so let's rethink that idea it's not 16 here we can't do that what's the maximum length I could cut it would be eight it'd be half that length because if I made a cut of eight here I made a cut of eight here that would be the most I could go without overlapping if you overlap you're cutting uh stuff that's not there anymore yes but you still wouldn't be able to make a box out of that no you wouldn't but we weren't able to make a box out of this either so if if we cut eight and eight can you take off that whole piece of material yeah your box and you did it from the other side your box is going to look like oh you cut this side off and cut that side off equal amount that's now your box it's a flat piece of paper that's much smaller you just wasted all your material but you could do it right again you'd be fired from box making but you could you could do it and that's our domain you got to think about these things don't just go with the formula I know look for two things in the formula we look for denominators we also look for roots but even if those things don't exist this is a realistic constraint you got to take into account if you're dealing with realistic stuff you got to really think about don't let yourself get tripped up by the 16 really think about what you can and you can't do with your your product I hope if you're all right with that okay now I wasn't going to do this but I'll give you a little refresher on some odd and even functions let's talk about odd and even function for just a little bit even functions are functions that have twos fours sixes and eights in them well that's not completely true but the powers should actually look like that odds are usually the ones 3es FIV sevens uh what we say mostly though is that even functions are going to be symmetric across the Y AIS odd functions are symmetric about the origin which means if you if you took them and you rotated them 180° about the origin it's going to make a mirror image with what you have already so for for even functions here's what even means like algebraically or formulaically when when you plug something in even function says if you plug in a negative number or if you plug in U negative x per se it's going to give you back out theun function just as if you had plugged in the positive version of that number so if I plug in -2 or two it says it doesn't matter that's even it is symmetric about the Y AIS now odd functions say this it says if you plug in a negative number it's like taking the function plugging in the positive of that number and making it negative that's what it happens with the odd function it says if I was to plug in -2 it'd be like I plugged in positive two got the answer and then made it negative do you see the difference between these two things all right this is this is odd and it's going to be symmetric about the origin like can see an example of some functions that are even and odd let's let's find one out each one each why you guys are asking for the moon today that work here's how you test whether something is even odod what you do is you plug in thex and you see what happens so I want to find F ofx what that means is that for every place I have an X I'm now going to put a negative X inside some parentheses it's it's like you're uh you're composing a couple functions okay you're just replacing x with negx so that means means for this you'd say I want to see what happens with x 4 -^2 + 1 so far so good don't use an actual number you don't need natural number just use the the negative X it's still going to work out for you how much ISX to the 4th x to the 4th because the the negative also gets to the fourth power right it is going to go away posi so this is going to become x 4 how much is what's this going to become so Min - x^2 and then + one did we get the same thing back again exactly the same thing back again yeah this actually equals FX if you plug in the negative X and it gives you back out your original function your F ofx does that mean it's odd or does that mean it's even this is definitely an even function yeah that's how you tell this is going to be symmetric across the y- AIS Mirror Image gee I bet you don't know what this one's going to be well I could trick it uh let's see what do I want to do yeah again to check odd or even you plug in the negative X see what happens so with with our problem we'll have G ofx but that says you're just going to take that Negative X and plug it in everywhere you see X Sox Cub minus X just like that notice X Cub okay we got it and the negative X takes that place that minus is still there regardless of what you plug in so that has to be there what happens with this problem sign switch well yeah negative negative X cubed is that back to our positive X or do you get a Negative X cubed out of that and this one yeah that's for sure plus here's how you tell the the odd if your every term in your function is opposite of what you started with that means what you could do is you could actually Factor this out if you factored ative 1 you would actually get look at thatx Cub - x do you see how if I factor out that negative I'm getting back my X Cub - x yes no this is negative of your original function this is negative FX negative that's my original so I now oh sorry I used F instead of the G shame on me oh my go I Mark you off two points for that on a test I really do actually so be careful with that um so if G of X when I plug in the negative back negative G of X that means it's even or odd odd what is it definitely odd be symmetric about the origin usually S curves are like this you have a good understanding of the even and odd concept now do you feel okay with what we talked about today it all make sense 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 0.3:  Review of Trigonometry and Graphing Trigonometric Functions
so let's talk about some trig functions we're going to start with some basic angles I'll show you how to use reference angles to find out trig functions of any angle you ever you come across uh we'll talk about some graphing of some triak functions which is going to be kind of interesting you'll see why they are the way they are and that should be our day so the first thing we're going to start with just a little bit of talk about angles now when we say an angle typically we mean an angle in reference to the the x-axis and we got a couple names for these things our angle would be given here I like to call Ita typically if we're going to start here this would be called our initial side what do they call the the side where the angle ends yeah that's the terminal side of course you see the movie The Terminal has nothing to do with angles but it's a pretty good movie you should check it out anyway now now if we're going to start the x-axis and go counterclockwise which is the the positive angle measurement clockwise or counterclockwise so going this way counterclockwise gives us positive angles if we go this way our counter our clockwise that gives us our negative angles so counterclockwise rotation gives us our positive angles and and in in Converse we have clockwise giving us our negative angle measurements now when we measure angles there's typically two two construct are measuring angles we either do degrees or we do let's talk a little bit about radians versus degrees where do they come from why why we have them radians are kind of interesting they involve that number Pi which really is a weird number in and of itself right I mean it doesn't end it doesn't repeat it's it's the an irrational well actually um yeah irrational number it's it's kind of strange and it's also relationship between the diameter and the circum of a circle and that's that's why we want to incorporate that in dealing with angles because we have parts of circles in that then we have this degree system that we also have uh that that most of the time that's how we describe angles to each other right at least here we say if I say okay can you draw me an angle of 60° you have no problem with that typically say draw me an angle of 3 pi over 14 you go what that's crazy you seriously going to draw well you can I mean you can draw that but you don't have that in our in our heads so normally we like to have ways to convert between them just so we're kind of familiar with them can use both of our angle measurements um if if you're not familiar with this how our radians and our degrees are are connected is with this equation 2 pi radians equals 360° reason why we say they're equal those are both the way you can represent a circle so this represents all the measurements degree wise of a circle and so does this for radians of a circle therefore they have to be exactly the same what this gives us if we do just a little bit of mathematics if we solve for radians or we solve for degrees you can even write like this de it's going to give us a method on how to convert between radians to degrees so for instance if we' uh want to solve for for degrees well we can divide by 360 and that's going to tell us that to change from radians to degrees we're going to be multiplying by pi over 360 that that that worked just fine so here's our our note to convert if you want to go from degrees to radians go from degrees to radians multiply by pi over 180 ulti pi over 180 what that's going to do is get rid of your degrees and introduce to you that that Pi that's going to change into radians for you uh the other way if we want to go from radians to degrees well multiply by what do you think yeah really you're just multiplying by one in a in a special way and if you divide both sides by two you're going to get Pi radians equals 180° so you're just using that equality uh to change between our degrees and radians would you like to try a couple examples to get your heads wrapped around this all right let's change uh we'll just do two examples really quick let's change 200° into radians and we'll change -3i 4 radians into degrees so 200° if I want to change 200° into radians well I'm already in the degree measurement I want to get rid of the degrees and introduce the radians so here I'm going to take my degrees sure in order to get rid of those units degrees you can't have degrees on the top that's going to be degrees squared right that that'd be that'd be ridiculous what we want to do is have our degrees on the denominator of that fraction and that kind of tells you where you which one of these if you if you forget all this which one of these equalities to use which one of these conversions if you're trying to get rid of degrees have degrees on the denominator then your Pi is going to be on the numerator and you'll see that the degree units those are gone you can cancel them out just like you would other variable or or amount can you reduce that that sure go ahead and do that you got calculators if you want to punch in the fraction just press enter what is this going to give us how much 10 10 pi over 9 okay 10 pi 9 radians so right there we know that 200° and 10 pi 9 radians is exactly the same measure of certain angle what other angle I tell tell you we were going to convert oh good number I made top of my head so good to remember that so 3i 4 all it's in radians we want to convert this to degrees which means we want to introduce the degree measurement what what that typically says is well we want to get rid of a pi somewhere so I'm thinking the pi is going to have to be on the denominator of my fraction and if I want degrees at the end of my problem I'm going to have 180° on the numerator my fraction does anything simplify out of this sure four goes in 180 how many times 45 okay and what anything else Pi ah the pies are gone that's great can you do the math tell me what we're going to get how many degrees 135 135 negative negative sure would this angle be measured uh counterclockwise or clockwise could you find the same angle by measuring some distance counterclockwise angles are strange like that right you can go negative or positive and somehow end with the same exact at least reference point not same angle same reference point on that Circle kind of cool by the way speaking of graphing let's go let's go ahead and go over just a little bit how to graph these appropriately so if I were to give you let's try 4 pi over 3 can you graph that on a circle or on an XY AIS yes no you can can you I can can you how do you do it how do you do it you know one circle is 2 you do so I know that this is this is actually pi and this is 0 or 2 pi well this has got to be Pi / 2 and this is got to be 3 pi/ 2 here's the way I always like to graph these things what I like to do is break up each section of Pi into whatever denominator I have that's the way I think is easiest for me so I think okay if this is 1 Pi I'm counting Pi being divided by 3 you see you can split this up and say okay this is four 4 * < 3 so what I want to do is find out where the 3 sections are count four of them and I'm going to have my angle is that Mak sense to you are we awake today I know it's Friday right you're like oh just just 47 more minutes please 37 more minutes please but stick with me here folks this is good stuff this trigonometry right I mean some of you trust me you need a refresher on this believe me so if I want to break this up my pi over 3s I think okay well here's I split like that here's one two three sections of equal value inside of my Pi does that make sense let's do the same thing down here so basically we've broken up each Pi into three parts or each 2 pi each circle into six parts how many are we going to count four we want four pies over three so 1 2 3 our angle is going to end right there you feel okay with that so far you sure now if I ask you to graph -2 pi over 3 -2 3 we'd start same initial side but we're not going counterclockwise anymore we're going clockwise where's it going to end you still break it up into three parts right every every Pi would be broken up into three parts if we're counting -2 that means we're going to start here one two let's call this uh 4 Pi 3 this would be our 2 pi - 2 pi 3 whenever you have that situation where one angle and a different angle go in the opposite direction and on the same exact uh terminal side they're called co-terminal it just means there's multiple ways to measure the same terminal side I could have gone around like 50 times right and then ended right there it's going to be the same exact ultimate ending spot how about we graph let's graph two more let's graph 5 Pi then we'll graph uh these are a little bit easier -7 pi/ 2 so 5 Pi of we're going to start with our our typical initial side that's our zero angle or 2 pi angle marker we've got Pi here Pi / 2 and 3 Pi 2 why don't you try the 5 Pi start at your initial side are you going to go clockwise or counterclockwise why counterclockwise okay so go ahead and do that count however many pies you have right now now we don't have to break this up at all because well there's no denominator so we're actually counting five pies let's go ahead and do that how many times a round am I going to go okay so I'm going to start here and go well here's here's one Pi 2 pi that's a Full Circle isn't it 3 Pi four you getting dizzy yet and then one more that's gonna give us a five Pi look looks like a spring all wound up do the7 pi over which go on your own of course you know this is zero and 2 pi it's already broken up into pi over 2 is 4 that's kind of Ni that's not a oh let's see where we end up okay we'll start our initial side negative I know that means we're going we're going clock I'm going to count 7 pi/ 2s going clockwise that's what our negative says so here's 1 2 3 four five six seven I know we're that as our terminal side we've just gone around time in a quarter time in 3/4s how people were able to end with with exact that cool are there any questions so far before we continue on to some actual trig functions we're going to put this stuff together now no yes you all right so far all right good now of course Somebody went and said how can we relate the sides of a right triangle and a unit circle along with their angles and so we have our unit circle up here and if we were to make a right triangle out of it it's a horrible right triangle there we go if we consider the point XY with any we're being General here so we have any any coordinates how far along is this right here whatever the x is true okay and and how far is this right here and if I say the unit circle how far is the hypotenuse in this case one one good that's that's what's a unit circle unit circle says has a radius of one what we what someone did a long time ago is they say okay we want to somehow represent the sides of a right triangle and call them something we want to call the ratios of our sides of a right triangle some function some trigonometric function so if we have any sort of angle on a right triangle just like we have right here and of course you know that's a hypotenuse we call this is this the opposite of the adjacent okay and this is the adjacent side we had a few trig functions let real clear before we go any further the stuff that says s cosine tangent th those are functions okay you you can't you can't compute those those aren't those aren't a number uh you can't ever just have a say I'm gonna take sign sign by itself doesn't mean anything s has to have some sort of expression of an angle inside of it if we just say can you take sin s plus cosine squar no you can't that doesn't mean anything that that this is not equal to one because you don't have any angle here you have to have exactly the same angle for that to be equal to one you have to have those angles in there for identities to work you to do the computations with them so if you ever find yourself writing s and cosine without any inside part you're probably making a little mistake be real careful that s and cosine have and tangent and all these Tri function have to be associated with some sort of an angle am I getting that across to you these are functions just based on that angle without that that doesn't make any sense okay now let's go back to this let's review what is sign exactly it's a relationship between which two sides good have you ever heard of Chief SOA TOA no maybe in high school Chief SOA TOA he asks you if you get this wrong I'm going to ask you a question yeah soaa says sign is opposite over hypotenuse and cosine is what SOA okay and tangent what's tangent opposite for sure we also get cosecant you know I'm going W down here so you see a little better the cosecant the secant and the cotangent they're just the reciprocals of the original Three tree functions that we have so which one goes with uh the cosine which one is the the reciprocal of our cosine yeah the see is so here this isn't adjacent over hypotenuse it's hypotenuse over adjacent well coent goes with Tangent that's going to be your adjacent over opposite and the cosecant that's the the reciprocal of our sign so you're the hypotenuse over the opposite well if we apply this idea of a basic right triangle to the unit circle we actually get ways to compute the S the cosine and the tangent and and all these these these reciprocals cosecant secant cent of any point that we have provided we can find the X and the y coordinate you see when we when we apply this if we look at the sign of this particular angle look at your angle tell me what sign is sign should be opposite over hypotenuse right that's what we Define it as over here what's the opposite to my angle what's the opposite to my angle what is it one oh one Why Oh I thought you said one like wait a second we got to review some trigonometry a little bit here opposite okay opposite is y over what sure how much is y over one yeah that's why we get on the unit circle that the y coordinate for that point is sign of that particular angle that's why we get that it's our it's our definition now so sinal y cosine cosine should be adjacent over hypotenuse so the adjacent of our angle is X the hypotenuse well that's one so we're going to get X over one or X that's why on the unit circle when you see a coordinate point x comma y you know cosine comes first and S comes second because we know that the cosine of the angle is the X it's that distance which is how we correlate that to any point so we go oh yeah okay the x coordinate that means the coine of that angle the y coordinate that means the sign of that angle that's kind of neat right it's way we we we combine the idea of a unit circle in our our trigonometry tangent tangent is opposite over adjacent so in our case that's the Y over the X which also leads us to our identity if you look at that what how much is equal to Y over here sign how much is equal to X you can say it out loud it's okay to talk in this class how much is X if we know that tangent is YX y = s and coineal X then this also leads to S over cosine right so we get our first identity tangent equal sign over cosine that's pretty easy to see not too bad now you can also do this with our um with our reciprocals here instead of opposite over hypotenuse as far as our unit circle goes we get cosecant we get secant and we get cotangent they're just the reciprocals of our identities here so if s is y cose is 1 over y if cosine X secant is 1x tangent is YX Cent x y by the way I would like you to do this go go in your book and read not right now go in your book and read through uh I think it's around page 30 through 35 somewhere in there they have a listing of common angles that we use it's going to really be helpful to you if I can say to you uh give me cosine of uh of pi over 3 and you're able to do it give me cosine of of pi/ two I mean at least give me give me sign of pyro 4 things like that it's going to help you a little bit so refresh your memory on that if you need the circle right now for your homework great but I want you to get kind of in the habit of knowing those by heart or by by memory can you guys do that for me at least look them over don't go in this class without knowing at least what I'm talking about okay knowing that those exist and and how to at least find them try to memorize unit CLE in your head got it are you guys familiar with what happens to to S cosine and tangent as we go around the quadrants you guys know what happens with that so for instance uh I know that there are four quadrants to any XY AIS or coordinate system and this is quadrant what was this quadrant and which one's two left or down left good and so that means that's three and this one's four we use Roman numerals because I have no idea we just do so Roman numerals that's how we got 1 2 34 are you familiar with what is positive in which quad Al all wait all students take calculus yeah oh I I always thought it was astrology sucks total crap but I could do anyway no just kidding yeah all students take calculus as a new mod to remember that in the quadrants certain certain trig functions have certain values for instance a means all the trig functions are positive right here all the trig functions are positive in the first quadrant students means sign is positive in the second quadrant what that also means is that cosecant is positive all students take so tangent and third that means cotangent as well and last one is cosine or secant so all students take that's not true though we got to find something that's true we got to find think of a better pneumonic formul like tral TR okay that was original how about uh the acronym surrounding this class I like that yeah that's that's very okay well you come with something better anyway all soon take calculus works just fine tells you what's positive and which quadr now one way that we can use this if you didn't know you're like H why do we even need to know that all students take take calculus or know the values of those quadrants is we can find out the trick function for any angle using idea called reference angles in combination with thec uh knowing the quadrants let me would you like to see how that's done let me show you how that's done so we're going to talk about reference angles just briefly then I'll show you how to combine the idea of reference angles with the idea of this or knowing our quadrants to determine the trig function and its value for any angle that I give you provided you know the unit circle okay that's a must so reference angles uh how to find Tri function any angle is is what this is and the idea is is this what we're going to do is we're going to try to make an acute angle with the xaxis and then we're going to use the find the trig function of that and then use the ASC idea well we really have four cases because there's really only four quadrants so here's what can happen what I'm going to do is give you a picture a representation of our angle and then show you how to find the reference angle let's say we start with just a regular angle right there is the angle acute yeah then we're already done then the angle is our reference angle so right down here the reference angle would just be Thea itself you don't have to do anything with that which means you can find the trig function for the angle pretty easily just by using your unit circle so that would be our reference angle however check it out if I go past Pi / 2 so for instance this one is that angle acute or what I want to do is find the reference angle here's the reference angle it's just the angle that the terminal side makes with the xais which happens to be acute so where this is my angle the reference angle would be this shaded version over here we just need a way to to represent the Shaded version right now so if this is our our terminal side and this is the x-axis how much would this tell me this how much would this whole angle be if it went all the way to here do it in terms of radius this would be Pi sure now would you agree that this shaded angle is pi minus whatever my original angle was that's how we find a reference angle in this case for this quadrant the reference angle would be Pi minus your angle that's going to give you an acute angle that that's formed between the xaxis and your terminal now just you're okay with this so far you see where the pi is coming from PI is coming from because well this is that's a measure of Pi we're subtracting our angle we're going to get that shade and region let's keep going what if we're over here can you see the reference angle I want to make right here this is going this is going past pi and then going a little bit my reference angle has to be an again an acute angle angle between the terminal side and the xais so what I'm looking at is this is the whole thing right that's the whole whole P or whole um angle I want just this little piece so let's see how much is it again from here to here okay now I'm going further this much further would you agree that this angle is all the angle minus Pi look at the angle so this is this is the whole thing right and I want to take away all the non-shaded stuff how much is all the non-shaded stuff that's Pi so our reference angle here would be Theta minus Pi okay last one it looks like packman a little bit in our case our reference angle is going to be this shaded section can you can you think about what that's going to be what do you think in order to find the Shaded section we're we're probably not going to do well we could do well no we can't we probably not do anything with pi but maybe with 2 pi 2 pi would be the Whole Thing 2 Pius 2 Pius the might work cuz 2 pi would be this whole stuff I want to subtract off the the Theta part that's going to leave me with that that cutout nuder if you're okay with that yes yes yes I'll take it so reference angle here okay raise your hand okay on where the reference angle idea comes from you feel all right with it good good now would you like to see how to actually use it yeah yeah probably that might be nice right let's see about that so let's say I wanted you to find you I'll move over here more say I wanted you to find s cosine tangent secant cant cent of 5i 3 can you do it sure if you have a unit circle handy absolutely if you don't have a unit circle handy all you would need to do is me Mize s cosine tangent of your first quadrant then usec that that's what I'm showing you here how to do if you have un Circle it's really not a problem you just go over right and find that stuff but check this out if we want to find sin cosine tangent of 5 pi over 3 using reference angles here's how we can do it the first thing you're going to do you're going to have to locate it which quadrant it's in so in other words you're going to have to grab it so right now as I'm writing right down the next step I want you to graph 5 pi over 3 okay we just practice that on your own paper graph 5 the next step after that we're going to use this idea of reference angles find your reference angle so 5 pi over 3 I'm thinking I got got to cut every Pi into three parts we've already done that today I know 5 pi over 3 is is positive so we're going to be going counterclockwise I'm going to count five pi over 3s so that means I'm going to go 1 2 3 4 so I should be ending at that one did you did that one also okay I'm going to race this stuff just to make it not so bad for us right now I want you to identify your reference angle can you shade it in just slightly shade in your reference angle be careful on your shading we want something between the terminal side and the x axis not the y- axis don't care about the y- axis I want something between the termal side in the xais so do I shade this do I shade this yeah that's what that's my reference angle we're actually in this situation right now so how can I find the value of my reference angle what would I do would I do the pi minus Theta or Theta minus Pi or the 2 pi which one am I going to do sure I know that this is my angle my 5 pi over 3 what I want to do is take the 2 pi and subtract my 5 3 that's going to give me this range so the reference angle would be 2 pi - 5i 3 if you do it right your reference angle should be something that's in the first quadrant it should be represented in that so uh how much is 2 pi - 5i over 3 yeah that's it you have 6 Pi 3 - 5 piun 3 that's pi over 3 are you guys okay with the fraction work so we've located the quadrant we got that down we know it's in the fourth quadrant we were able to use that to find the reference Angle now the idea is I want you to find all your trick functions of the reference angle so find the treat functions of the reference angle so what I want from you is s cosine and tangent of pi over 3 if we know the top of your head how much is a s of pi over 3 do you know yeah that's exactly right off the top of your head no okay somebody else let's all play along here come on let's do uh cosine of pi over 3 yeah cosine pi over 3 is 12 if you have cosine and you have S you should be able to find tangent because tangent we we just found this out is just s over cosine so if I divide s over cosine I'm going to reciprocate and multiply how much is T of p 3 please perfect I'm not going to do the rest of them but you can see that you could do the same exact thing with cosecant secant and cotangent yes would your feel okay with this so far getting those because this is a basic trigonometry here's how the reference angle idea worked with the ascc if you know what quadrant this is in you knew that it was everything's positive here s's positive here tangents positive here cosine is positive there and everything else is negative here here's the deal once you have this this is the reference angle right all we got to do is interpret what quadrant it was in use the appropriate ASC and then we're going to be able to find out s of 5 pi3 and cosine 5i 3 and tangent so if s of 3 is < tk32 s of 5 pi over 3 without doing any more work is s let's see is s positive or negative in this quadrant definitely negative why well because the only thing that's positive is cosine the rest of them are negative you follow me on that so here we go okay what's what's s of 5 3 then it's definitely negative because sign has to be negative there have you already found out the reference angle measurement just use that measurement with the appropriate sign root3 over two I think I've lost some people because some of you look confused you're like I have no idea what's going on here let's see are you okay with STC that's cuz someone beat it into your head a long time ago you just remember are you okay with the reference angles how to find those okay good you're just subtracting or uh from something or you're subtracting two quantities to make a an acute angle with the x-axis are you okay that this angle goes to here and at this reference angle you have to take 2 pi minus the 5i 3 and what you end up getting is pi over 3 are you okay with that are you okay with getting a pi over 3 are you sure I need head NDS or something you can't just look at me okay yes or no that's okay too if you're no yes okay can you find S cosine and tangent of Pi 3 yall should be going yes because that's in the necessity to even be in this class you're supposed to be able to do that right you have to be able to do that here's the only thing I'm asking you to do what I'm asking you to do is look at what quadrant that reference angle's in what what quadrant your angle is in whatever quadrant you're in that's telling you what's positive and what's not you just said you got ASC right now put it to practice this is useless if you can't do anything with it so you know that if my angle was here everything would be positive I would be done cuz my angle would be pi over 3 if if your angle's here you know that the only thing that's positive is sign everything else is going to be negative do you get it if your angle's here you know that tangent is going to be positive everything else is negative because s over cosine negative negative give you positive that's why tangent is positive if you're angles here you know the only thing that's positive is cosine the rest of them are negative do you get me you've already done the leg work you already know the values this was the hard part now you just got to put uh the signs on top of them so we're we're right here we know the only thing that is positive is which one's positive for this cosine positive for this this one I'm going to leave alone is sign positive in this quadrant I'm going to make it negative is tangent positive in this quadrant no I'm going to make it negative and that's all I'm doing right here so I can guarantee you my answers are going to be < tk3 over2 positive 12 and < tk3 that's it s of 5 3 is that because we already did the reference Angle now we know the sign cosine of 5i 3 is 12 why because I already did the leg work I know the value I'm just trying to figure out the sign if cosine still positive there notice if we doing a reference angle it's all based on quadrant run one run run run from this trigonometry stuff if if you're doing a reference angle it's all based on quadrant one that means every number you're going to get is positive that's why you have to usec to find out whether or not it's actually NE do you see the difference there that's the point so here I know coine cosine remains positive I know and tangent do not so in order to get from the pi over 3 to the 5 pi over 3 it's not I'm not Harry Potter I'm not the math version of that right this isn't Magic it's just using the fact that use a reference angle and now you know that if it's in a certain quadrant What's positive and what's not does it make more sense now to you yeah good that was less anticlimactic than I wanted I wanted like like a woo I get it can we try that once no I'm just kidding you don't have to do wo I get it but hopefully the energy level will go up for you someday how were you when you took your class I don't remember I took math 4C in summer school so that that was literally a six week blur I do not remember hard any of it I had to go relearn it awesome don't don't do that to yourself if you're going to do anything with mathematics if you don't if you don't give a crap about this sure take it during summer school but if you actually want to use it and going to have to use it don't take it during summer school oh my God unless you're like a superar math some of you are do it fine I wasn't okay last thing we're going to talk about today in the last about 3 minutes is a little bit of graphing where the stuff comes from uh what I need you to do is read through or at least be familiar with your basic Tri graphs okay I need you to know what s looks like what cosine looks like what tangent looks like s goes like this and cosine goes like this and tangent goes like this okay and know where they start what their period is things like that you need to know that at least if you don't know that you won't be successful with this graphing part so we're going to graph a couple different types of functions here we're things of the form y = a * s of some angle or cosine of some angle and then I'm going to make it a little bit more complicated than that okay we're going to graph another form probably next time where we're going to make this a littleit more advanced so for instance our example for this I'm going to graph y = sinx just our our standard S curve and Y = let's see uh two s of 4X and we're going to see the difference between these two graphs firstly let's talk about sign right off the bat where does sign start or that that one does yeah how high does sign go what's the period for sign Pi that means it oscillates every 2 pi why well it's it's on a circle right it's going to come back to the same thing every time you go around that Circle that means something important is also going to happen at Pi that means something important is probably going to happen at Pi / 2 and something important is probably to happen at 3 Pi / 2 tell me if sign starts at zero what what's s of pi oh boy go refresh your memory on that what was everyone be nailing that what's sign of Pi you're just copying everyone else yeah you're lucky it's zero what's s of 2 pi yeah of course because it's going back to the same thing as Z so s of 0 is 0 S 2 pi has to be zero what's s of Pi 2 tell me that mhm and uh s of 3/ 2 lucky guess just kidding so our function has this nice script this is where we get it from like that what we're going to find out next time is what this number does and what that number does and how it changes it does it stretch it out does it compress it does it make the amplitude go different we're going to find all that out next time then we'll talk about this in combination some translations uh that will about our day and we'll we'll go on to the the last section of our review and finally get to some calculus stuff you excited I'm excited I'm excited well happy Monday uh we're going to go ahead and continue talking about what we were talking about which is graphing some trig functions now the basic ones I've asked you to read through that you should know what s and cosine and tangent look like this is our our basic sign graph what we're going to do today is figure out what all these numbers do to these graphs how we can manipulate that so here's the deal whenever we're looking at something of this form like uh a sin BX or a cosine of BX that a and that b those do something the a in front of our sign or our cosine that actually will give you the do you know that's the amplitude that's exactly right so R A actually the the absolute value of our a is going to give us our amplitude and we mean amplitude from the x- AIS so that's why when we graph s of X well there's only a one out there the a is in fact one which means that our amplitude is one up and and one down from the x-axis does that make sense to you what's our B in this case our B gives you the well actually it's the period uh but what's the b in this particular example the B here is four what's the B here one and we know that in our case our our period is actually 2 pi so what we're going to get from our our B is our period so if our B in this case is one and our period happens to be 2 pi then the period is really given by 2 Pi / B that gives us how often we oscillate or how often we come back to repeating the same exact graph is it that specific example or is that that's in general so in in general your amplitude is given by the absolute value of a so in our case let's let's look at this example right here uh so this is our kind of our notes for right now what is our a in our our case for our new example that we're going to do in just a minute two two so our amplitude absolute value of two is two that means it should be going two high and two low from the x- axis are you with me on that okay so for our example I'll write this out again by the way we need a muffler for your for your sneezes as you go just like that shifting gears that' be cool should invent that see money right there red box and mouth Mufflers done just kidding just kidding uh this works the same exact same exact way for a cosine B so those those are the same exact letters those work the same way so let's look at Y = 2 s of 4X and you've already told me that my amplitude my a is the absolute value of two which is two that means we're going to be going up to two and down to -2 that's what the amplitude says here we also need to find the period the period is given by 2 pi over B what's the what was the b in this case again so let's do do that can you simplify 2 pi over 4 two I need you all to be familiar with how to get the amplitude and the period nod your head if you're okay on getting the amplitude and the period in this case good all right amplitude comes from the h just absolute value the the period is given by 2 pi over whatever our B is we simplify that here's what it means it means that this example our the the stuff in the black writing here this is going to oscillate or or repeat every pi/ 2 how you do this if our entire period is 2 pi here what we're saying is our entire period is Pi / 2 here it's going to come back to that point after cycling that's going to be one complete cycle so can you tell me how many cycles I'm going to get in this Range four four Cycles that's four ranges of Pi / 2 four intervals of Pi / 2 does that make sense to you so the period says how often you come back to normal so it's going to go up down and back up then up down and back up four times in this span what did this essentially do to it did this stretch it out or did that compress it compress very much so compressed it so what this did is it compressed it and it stretched it vertically that's what the amplitude did so here's how you can figure out how to graph it though it's going to start the same spot so we're going to be at 0 0 we're going to go up down and back up what happens with these trig functions like s and cosine is the interesting stuff happens at the midpoints so if we're coming back to normal at pi/ 2 something interesting is going to happen at pi over 4 that's midway between there does that make sense to you so pi over 4 something interesting is going to happen okay and that that means I know this is really small it's hard for you guys to see it so this is p 4 right there power four how about midway between 0 and pi over 4 how much is that 8 so let's cut that in half something interesting is going to happen at pi over8 and 3 pi over 8 that's between here over 8 and 3 over 8 now here's how you go the rest of the way we know that the the original function crossed midway between the r two end points here so midway between at this pi over 4 that's where we're going to be crossing the x-axis again can you tell me where the peak of my sign function is going to take place the peak of my well it's going to be a level of two sure but what's the x value of that do you know all right because we know something interesting is going to happen there in this case the peak was at Pi / 2 if we scrunches all together the peak's now going to be at Pi 8 where's the the lowest Valley going to be where's that going to have take place sure that's that's at this one right here so let me recap for real this time not just a you know recap uh what we do in this case is we find our a we find our B the a is going to give you the amplitude how high and how low you go the B is going to give you a period how often you cycle back to the same exact value and repeat your whole nice function so in our case here we know we're going to cycle within a very small window of Pi / 2 we know we're going to go up to two and down to -2 that's going to be my highest and my lowest point how you figure out the rest of it is just the midpoints of that interval at the midpoint of that interval you know something's got to happen in our case we're going to be crossing the x-axis again at the midpoints of those intervals we're going to be reaching our maximum and our minimum value respectively so then we can graph it's just a normal sign function only we've stretched it this way and compressed it this way now you if you're okay with that okay so we're going to be going like this wow that's like that that's our compression we could fit four of those in that range of space would your r hand feel okay with the soap okay would you like to try one more example to see this before we move on to a translation okay why don't you see if you can do this one I'm giving you0 5x but it could easily be X over 2 or 12x okay so5 12 or X over2 that all means the same exact thing here's what I I would like out of you right now what I want you to do draw yourself a nice looking graph and draw the original cosine function just what cosine looks like normally okay just draw that we're going to erase it but I want to get the picture in your head draw the original cosine function then I want you to find your a your amplitude and I want you to find your period do those three things right now I'm going to do on the board but you should have it on your paper oops for okay so before we start dealing with the amplitude and the period I need you to get the the idea the picture of the function down so the picture of the function just the cosine where does cosine start at it goes where goes up okay goes up so cosine would normally start right here at one and go like that do you have that same graph on your paper right now you sure are you positive so we know we're not going to be starting at zero we're going to be starting at either one or negative one depending on what the sign is in front of our function if we've got a negative sign in front of our function you all should know from just your basic algebra and trigonometry classes that if you got a negative what that does is that reflects it does that make sense so we're going to have a complete flip so whereas this would be the cosine function the negative cosine function would start there does that make sense to you you go up and then back down that's what that one would do okay so we have an idea of what this is going to look like it's going to be some it's still going to be a nice curve like sign was only this time it's not going to start at z0 it's going to start at either a positive or A negative number now have you found your amplitude yet how much is your amplitude three okay how' you find three why isn't it negative3 okay good so absolute value of3 is three and your period did you find your period yet we'd find period by doing 2 pi over whatever our B is in our case our B is .5 if we divide 2 by .5 we're going to get four did you get four Pi do it a calculator if you have to two divided 0.5 is four four Pi have you this so far finding the amplitude and the period okay good all right what that means is that we're going to be cycling from our starting point to our ending point in a period of 4 Pi not not shorter now it's going to be what is that is that a compression or a stretch stretch that's stretch so what you're kind of realizing right now that a number that's bigger than one is going to be a compression a number that's smaller than one for example a decimal that's that's less than one or fraction less than one that's going to be a a stretching out a number bigger than one in front is an amplitude gain uh a number less than one in front is amplitude squishing down okay it's shrinking that amplitude do you guys get the idea all right here absolute value less one so between Zer and yeah absolute value between 0 and one that would probably be the best way to say that right okay good catch now how do you figure out where to start well do we start at three do we start at neg3 what do you think3 why well firstly there's a negative in front of it secondly why don't you plug in zero what's uh what's 05 time 0 what's cosine zero cosine of 0 is one look at you in the circle you got to know these things at least are simple ones if you don't know s cosine tangent of at least zero Pi / 2 pi and 3 pi over 2 and 2 pi you you need to go back do it today do it tonight make sure you know at least those ones I mean those are huge okay you also should know the pi over 3 pi over 4 pi over 6 then you can use reference angles for the rest but you need to know those at least four you with me on that you got it it's got to be tattooed on your brain hurt but do it or on your forehead you read it backwards in the mirror get it down coine Z one right so cosine of 0 would be 1 what's 1 * -3 we're starting AT3 so we are starting here guess what if we're starting there and my period is 4 Pi I'm ending there the interesting things happen to happen in the middle of our intervals that's how these work so if we have a period of 4 PI what's the middle of our 4 Pi here something interesting is going to happen at 2 pi is it going to be Crossing zero a peak or a valley it's only one of those three things Crossing zero remember I've got to I've got to go up peak come down and end here I'll give you a hint it's going to be it's going to be a peak and the reason is the the same thing happens in the middle as it does at ends for instance if you're Crossing zero at the ends you're Crossing zero in the middle are you Crossing zero at the ends then you're not Crossing zero in the middle that's not what that's not what's happening if you're peing at the ends somehow either a value or PE you're going to be peeking in the middle so what's going to happen here is it a peak or a it's not Crossing zero is it a peak or a value a it's a peak do you see why you can't you can't do this okay this is just one repeat of that that that same number so here you're going to have a peak of three that's the only way that can work that's only way you can make one oscillation through that one cycle and come up the same exact the same exact ending spot you can't go up cross here down that would that would do it you can't do it on that uh specific value it's not going to be Crossing zero there what's going to happen at pi and 3 Pi you tell me that that's where you're Crossing at pi and 3 Pi sure remember our original cosine function did that nice swoop just that was that was it we're just making it bigger and longer so it's going to go up and come back down do you guys see where all these points are coming from are you okay with that interesting thing has happened at the middle of your intervals so middle of interal that's 2 pi if you Peak at the ends you're peeking in the middle and you're Crossing at the the other two midpoints of those sub intervals so we'll draw our function not real pretty for me but I'm not an artist so we're going up coming back down that's only way we can complete that graph do you guys have a basic understanding about how to do these cosine and sign functions now how many people do feel okay about it might take some practice right I have to look at those things go back to these notes watch the videos if you want to have you guys all been to the website by the way yeah it's a good place to to find at least a homework and if you struggle on some of the stuff review those videos now there's one one more thing that we haven't talked about we've done stretches and compressions both with amplitude and with the period what haven't we done it's only one other thing we're going to learn how to shift it yeah that's a whole bunch of shift isn't it oh my gosh that's F okay so the amplitude and the period That's not going to change but what we are going to do is we're going to take a look at what happens if it's not just BX what happens if it's like BX minus something it will shift it's going to shift we're going to find out how to do this how to figure out what type of shift it is and uh and then we'll do an example well the first thing I need you to do I'm going to work with um with this one to show you how it's done but this right here this really isn't going to give it to you it's not going to tell you what the actual shift is you got to do a little bit more math with that so here's what we're going to do we're going to force B to be factored out of those two things so here's the idea if we force B to be factored you're going to write it as y equals the a is not going to change the sign you can't change that but when I say you're going to force B to be factored out of it you're going to divide both things by B if I divide both of those terms terms by B divide that by B what do you get good X okay and somebody else divide this by B what do you get netive C over B very good yeah that we're forcing B to be a factor now whether it actually divides it or not who cares uh we're we're making it divide both of those things one's going to be a fraction the other one's going to just be X by itself now you have be okay with that see where it's going okay we're going to do the same thing with with the cosine so I'm not going to show the work again you would just write it the same exact way this C over B that's where we get our translation that's going to be a shift along the x axis so a shift along the x- axis now it's kind of crucial that you get the shift correct got to get that shift right all right make it's fun to say shift isn't it whole lot of shift in this class what' you learn whole bunch of shift letters class whole bunch of oh if you have this if you have minus C over B please write this down correctly if it's minus C over B like uh x minus this amount even though it says minus C over B what that's going to do that's a shift to the right right this is defined as subtracting the the translation so this right here this minus C over B is a shift to the right so if it's minus C over B you're going to shift right if it's plus C over B you're going to shift it left I'll explain to you why right now why this is the way it is in in two different ways firstly algebraically a shift is defined as x minus the shift so minus the translation that's a shift to the right if you have this check it out X plus C over B would technically be x - c over B do you see that it'd be minus the shift that's a left translation right there that's where that negative is coming from so I'm not crazy all right plus I know in your heads you want to go right but in this case that plus means left um how you another way you can think of it is like a timeline okay if you are adding a number to something you are you're um you're speeding up when it happens according to a timeline timelines go this way right with the soonest thing's happening here and later things happening this way if you add something to a number it's not happening here anymore it's happening sooner than that does that make sense to you you're speeding up when that happens you're adding something to it it speeds up when you attain that value that it's an interesting way of thinking about it if you subtract something like this if you subtract something it's slowing it down it's not happening at at year zero it's now happening later it's slowing down when that would happen that's a shift to the right does that make sense to you it's a different way you can think of translations so um we're going to practice this we'll do we only get time for one example with this stuff but let's practice doing all this stuff with a uh we'll do a side doesn't that look fun yeah no not really not really at all well if we look back at the the notes that I just gave you what's the first thing you might want to do yeah you're going to force it to factor who said that good job you're going to force it to factor what number am I trying to divide out in this case the two very good that's our B right we want to factor out the b so go ahead and make it happen I'll write on the board as you write on your paper Factor the B out but three doesn't change I want you to write it like this what should the first thing be yep it's always going to be X right because you're going to factor that b out of there it's still going to be a plus you're not changing the sign at all Now is it going to be Pi Pi / 2 or pi over 4 because you're dividing out another two does that make sense if you do this if you do pi over two which is what you have divided two which is factoring factoring is division what this is is pi/ 4 you reciprocate and multiply does that make sense pull that out reciprocate you're going to get 12 * 2 that's going to be 4 now let's write out everything that's meaningful about this statement right now I want the amplitude so go ahead and do that I want the period to go ahead and do that that's given by your B remember and I want I want you to determine what type of shift this is and by how much so write out the amplitude write out the period and write out the shift just think if you live at home with your parents and you go home and do your homework and they're like hey can you help me this no I'm taking care of some serious shift right now that's be a good line please someone try that bear let me know if it works I always was thinking of those excuses when I was a kid none of them ever worked I wasn't that smart you guys now I'm giving you all the hints okay amplitude how much is your amplitude good yall got that right absolute Val 3 is three the period is 2 pi over the B that's the number that you just factored out so what is our period here yeah you're right I almost wrote right there equals Pi all right the shift now the shift is this going to be a right shift or a left shift what do you think yeah even though it says plus you your brain wants to think it's to the right right but it's not it's to the left this you can think of as it's speeding up it's happening sooner if that's moving to the left according to the timeline or if you think about the definition of what a translation really is it's minus a negative translation so that is definitely to the left of Pi 4 okay well we got that I'm going to show this to you you can graph this with only one graph all right but I'm going to show this to you as the original function this is how I think about it I think about the the original function I think about the Amplified and this is going to be a compressed function and then I deal with with the shift because if you try to do it all at once it gets a little confusing you with me on that so deal with the amplitude and the stretch compression first and then draw draw that one and then shift it so here's what I mean by that the first thing I know it's going up to three and down to3 the next thing I know you you need to know the period how much is the period okay so over here I'm going to put a pi and that's going to be my ending point I know for a fact that interesting things I use interesting things interesting things are going to happen which means points that we're going to are going to be valys or Crossings of the x-axis are going to happen in the middle of this interval so this is my my end goal is going to be this I know I'm positive because I have no negative it's it's going to go down and come back up and end right here does that make sense to you that's what's going to happen the interesting stuff's going to happen here at p over two here at pi over 4 and here at what is that one yeah do you feel okay that we're going to be going up and down to three do you feel okay that we're going to complete a complete cycle in pi time in the in the interval of Pi do you feel okay that this we need those numbers because that's where the interesting stuff is going to happen yes no yes okay so let's figure out what this is remember we haven't done the shift yet we're just going to draw the function without the shift and then we'll deal with the shift we'll just move it over Okie so let's deal with this function if I were to ignore the shift for a second where does it start three it's either three because it's cosine right it's not at zero it's either three org3 in this case which is it definitely you plug in zero you're going to get three remember not not with that though you're ignoring that for second so I would start here that means I'm going to end there got it that means that what happens at pi/ 2 is that a peak a zero or a valley you should be able to tell me right now Valley definitely a valley absolutely you're right here what happens at Pi 4 and 3 Pi 4 then that's our Crossings so my graph should look like oh that's not bad I got that on video too look at that that's pretty feel good good job Le good gra like the best one I've ever done my gosh remember that it's never going to happen again all right this is it would you agree that this is my function without the shift now that shift it said to the right to the left which one left what that means is that all we've got to do is take every key Point boom boom boom boom boom all five of those key points shift them pi over 4 to the left and then redraw it that's all that means so fortunately for us we have almost all the P fours listed right that's cool we just got to make sure that this distance that's p 4 you said to the left so here's what it does it's the same level just shifted oh boy I saw you're confused looks dang it that's my third mistake today I'm passed my quota by one for the week I make two mistakes a week that was it dang it okay I know it's Monday right that's that'll be my excuse too m h yes very good so what we're going to do is take each of these key points we're going to shift them one interval of Pi 4 to the left redraw so they at the same level though so this point was at 0 now it's attive 4 3 that's right there this point was at Pi 4 0 now it's at 0 0 are you with me on how we're doing this right now this was at pi over 23 now it's at Pi 4 that's 43 okay cool this was at 3 pi over 4 we're going to shift it Pi 4 to the left that's now at Pi 2 this point was at Pi Pi comma 3 now it's going to be shift Pi 4 to the left that's 3 Pi 4A 3 we've just shifted every major point to the left that's because we have shift to the left of Pi 4 if you redraw it that'll be the purple line right now see I missed told again we get the actual function this was the one we copied you can't do that if you use pencil uh but this is this is our shifted over version the purple one's the one we need to end with would your raise your hand you okay with our our shift good all right that's good did you think they were going to be as as nice as this it's nice huh do it this way if You' never done this before this is a good way to do it now what I do need you to do is you need to review your trig identities in the book I I think it's somewhere on page 36 or 37 review those things we're not going to be dealing with anything super super duper hard like some obscure ones but the basic ones you absolutely must have like uh tangent equals sign over cosine you got to have that you got to have the Pythagorean one down where sin square plus cosine squal 1 and the derivatives of not derivatives that's a wrong word to use in Calculus class but the U the cories from that such as 1 minus sin squal cosine squ you need those things okay you also need like your half angle and your double angle formulas you need the ones that say uh sine of 2x is the same thing it's 2 sinx cosine X you need those okay so so review those have them in your head somewhere be able to use those things because we will use them when we're doing integrals and derivatives of trig functions you need them 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 0.4:  Combining and Composition of Functions
all right now the last bit of review last section that we're going to cover in this class is 0.4 we're going to talk about how to combine some functions I am not going to spend a whole lot of time on this maybe 20 25 minutes or so uh we're going to go kind of quick on it I just want to make some some key points show you a few things that we can do and that's it combining functions really what I need you to to to know is that we can add subtract multiply divide and compose functions that that's really about it uh what we mean by add subtract multiply and divide if I give you these two functions like f ofx = this and G ofx is this you need to know how to add subtract multiply and divide it's it's not not hard it's not a big deal if we want f+ G ofx what that means is we're just going to Simply add the functions together f ofx plus G ofx in our case that means we'd have 1 + < TK 2 - x - 2 plus x - 3 you get rid of your parentheses by Distributing if you had to and then combine some like terms in our case uh we should be getting -2 + < TK x - 2 plus X can you verify that that's the right answer yeah it's so okay you should be able to do things like f minus G ofx which is basically the same thing except you have a minus in the middle you have to distribute a negative you've been doing this stuff since basic algebra which is why we're not going to spend a whole lot of time on it in our case we'd have 1 + < TK x - 2 - x - 3 notice though this is just a little different than the addition with the addition you can just drop parentheses as there's no negative to distribute however what happens to these sides those are definitely going to change you guys see that they're going to change yes no that's going to be minus X and then the plus three you see the plus three so our answer you can verify this later on your own this is going to be 4 + < TK x - 2 - x if you did F ofx time d ofx That's a same thing only you're going to have to distribute so in our case you get something like x + x < TK x - 2 then you'd get - 3 - 3 < TK x - 2 and there's nothing you can do to combine that that would be it maybe maybe factor that back out but I mean you'd be doing circular mathematics so that's it the only thing we can do with with our basic operations is f over G ofx in this case we just put one function over the other in the appropriate order and make sure we have a new domain restriction uh for in our case right here you knew that X could not be equal to three are you guys seeing the three also one one note that I do need to make um when you're doing these functions and they're asking you to find the domain I'll write this out for you the domain is the intersection of the domains of the original uh functions you can't ever get rid of domain problems all you can do is make more of them let me give you one example of that uh so that you see what I'm talking about let's say that I had this and this and I asked ask you for this first give me a little head on if you're okay on how all these came about all right that's pretty basic stuff if you add the ftimes GX check this out this would be the square root of x time the of X yes no how much is the of x * the of X okay so the question is what's the domain is it all real numbers no no is it all real numbers it looks like it doesn't it it looks like oh I can plug all those things in but the idea is where did that come from what functions did it come from can you plug in all numbers to this can you plug in all numbers to that can you plug in negatives to either of those then the problem is even though it looks like it you can't plug in negatives here do you remember the idea with the hole I introduced it to you a few days ago I said even though it looks like it it was just X Plus two looks like you should be able to plug in or xus 2 whatever it was looks like you should be able to plug in two you couldn't right because the domain came from the original function before you simplified it the same thing happens here make this note uh when you're looking for a domain the domain is actually the intersection intersection is what numbers are common to both functions of the the uh the addition subtraction multiplication or the division of those functions so the domain is the intersection of the domains of the original functions that's that symbol that upside down U of the original functions so for here if you were asked to find the domain the domain is not all real numbers heck no even though it looks like it the domain is not all real numbers what the domain is is numbers that are greater than or equal to zero why because that came from my original two functions that's what those are coming from how many people understand that but you can't just look at the final answer and give me a better domain I I said this it it was actually kind of a key point from a few days ago I said you can't ever make a domain better all you can do is make more problems that's all you can do by combining functions we can't change the domain of this all we can do is make it worse by doing this right that made it worse you actually have a bigger problem here with that three you can't fix domain problems all you can do is make them worse somehow that sucks but it's true does that make sense to you you can't ever fix it all right last thing we're going to talk about uh we can also compose functions this will be the last thing that we do just make sure that you know how to do compositions I I'll go really quickly through this this is an intermediate algebra concept so I'm going to make sure that you know it uh what we need by compositions is if I have f ofx xal like x 3 - 4 and G of X is theun X we're basically just substituting in one function for another so these two things unless they're inverses will have different answers if they are inverses their answer will both be X that's how you tell whether two functions are inverses or not so F of G ofx I'll go through this one time uh you make it f of G ofx or even said the same way then you start your substitution you write F of what is g ofx so we're going to write f of x what this says is you look at the function f what's the function f right now read it out loud to me x- yall see that's x cubus 4 let let me kind of go back a little bit I think I've lost some of you what we're doing with compositions is inserting one function into another function so how you start with it the letters are in the same order here and here F of g ofx f of G ofx then we do a substitution we actually do the composition G ofx becomes what G ofx is so G of X we're writing otk X you with me on that the only letter that's left that represents a function is the letter F agreed so you go to that function f says what was it again everyone say X good you say it again your X Cub - 4 x Cub - 4 you get it then everywhere you said X replace that word with the word parentheses so instead of X Cub minus 4 you're going to do parentheses Cub - 4 do you get that and that's what you write you okay F was X Cub - 4 I'm going to write parentheses Cub - 4 parentheses cub four you okay with that so far whatever was in this parenthesis now goes in that parenthesis and that is your composition that's as easy as that okay we can do it that way for every composition you have the other way you would have G of F ofx that is g of well F ofx is X Cub - 4 the only letter that represents a function is G I look at the G it says Square root of x so I think square root of x square root of x square root of parentheses so I'm going to write square root of parenthesis why because G said square root of parenthesis right there what goes in this parenthesis what goes in that parentheses whatever was in this one and that's how you do your your composition how many feel okay with the composition that's a real fast way to do it last compositions that we need to talk about in the last 5 minutes or so you should be able to do like multiple compositions as well so for instance if I say something crazy like you got three functions compose all of them should be able to do that so let's say that we had like f of x G is 1 /x H is X cubed can you do they used to call them fog and Goff right can you do Fogo ha can you do that one F of G of H what do you think yeah why don't you try to on your own and see if you come with the same thing I get I'm going to spend about 30 seconds doing it so see if you get it I'm going to do it real nice and slow up on the board okay try it let's see F of G of H of X oh my well that's F of G of X Cub cuz that's h of X all right I got that now I can looking on the inside of my parentheses G says 1 /x true so this says F of G said 1/x that's one over parentheses one over parentheses that would be one overx Cub you see where the X Cub is coming from okay now it's the only letter that represents a function left is f so F says square root of x so I'm going to say okay square root of x that's square root of parentheses root parentheses is 1 XB or if you want to be fancy about it the square root of one is one uh X that that's to the the 1/2 power so that would be the square of X Cub like this do you agree and you can write that as well as 1 x^ 3 power remember those fractional exponents power over root you can do that now if I asked you for this question can you find F of G of H of 8 can you do that what's that mean to do yeah it means find this which you already did right you already have that on the board now can you plug in eight plug in eight you're going to get 1 over 8 to the 3es by the way the easy way to do these without a calculator take oh wait did I give you the wrong one no I didn't that's fine uh I guess you would do it just plug in your calculator what do you get out of that do the three halves one over is it a decimal yeah okay well leave it 1 over 8 to the 3es for now if it's something like a four you could have taken a square root and then cubed it uh you would have gotten right the last thing we're going to talk about oh we got 30 seconds perfect you should be able to also go backwards for instance if I have given you something like u h of x = x - 7 Cub can you write that as a a composition F of G of X can you write that as a composition for instance can you define the inside part as one function the outside part as another function and write it appropriately so that when you compose them it gives you that there the answer is always yeah you pick the inside part as a trivial function X or or or I'm sorry you pick the inside part as one function and then you always have like X the 3 so for instance in our case I would say FX would be x 3 that's the outside part remember how we said parenthesis to the what x was parenthesis whenever you see the parentheses just treat that like an X that's x to the 3 and then G of X would be the inside part and that would be your composition so we should be able to go backward as well how many feel okay with what we talked about good deal 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 1.1:  An Introduction to Limits
so let's get started with our our actual calculus stuff oh this is going to be awesome so with our calculus we're going to talk about limits first now our limits is really the basis to our calculus it's how we do calculus we're going to find out some kind of tricks to calculus later but for right now if you know how to do limits you're going to be able to do calculus so it's probably a pretty important idea yeah yeah so we're going to find that out towards the last part of this class uh for right now I want to lead you through in introduction to calculus and what it's all about are you ready to learn that so view is over with thankfully now we're going to slow down just a little bit uh we're going to talk about actual calcul stuff so no more really hair raising kind of oh my gosh so much stuff uh we're going to go a little bit slower but it's going to be more in depth you ready for it slightly slower not not much slower in calculus we have two basic goals in calculus one this this introductory course calculus so here's our two goals goal number one the first goal and the one that we're going to spend most of our class on at least the first half of our class on is this school given any curve given any curve not straight line straight lines are easy but given a curve I want to be able to find the slope of a curve at a point isn't that the interesting idea if I say to you I want you to go ahead and find me the slope at that point right now we really have no idea how to do it I mean you can approximate it you can go oh okay I'll find your slope let's see slope is2 [Music] is that accurate no idea right we can't really just kind of approximate slope what we're going to do is find out a really good way using calculus on how to find the slope of a curve at a point in fact when I ask you a certain thing in this class you're going to say oh it's the slope of a curve at a point we're going to talk about that for a long time that's goal number one goal number one is to find the slope of a t or to find the tangent to a curve at a point the tangent is the line that intersects a curve at one and only one spot in a in an area so goal number one find the tangent which involves the slope of the curve at a point that's goal one if we can do that we're we're on calcus fast pass Fast Pace that's that's good so we want to take a curve be able to find the slope of that curve at a point that's going to lead you the tangent and and vice versa tangent and slope uh go hand in hand for for us goal number two which is the last half of our class maybe a little less than that goal number two is it's also a really interesting question so cool by the way this stuff is stuff you can't answer in any of class right you can't you can't do that with algebra there's no way you can do that algeb bro you can't find the slope of a curve are you kidding me slope of a straight line easy slope of a curve wow it's weird that's is that not an intriguing idea to you it should be if you're in this class like that's kind of it's kind of cool how you going to find SL of a curve I don't know calculus the next question is probably even a little bit more interesting next question is let's suppose I have some funky any curve that that you can think of as long is defined by a function can you between two points find the area under that curve can you do it the answer is right now with what you know can you do that with geometry no because I could say okay great uh find the area of something that's curving can can you do that no no you can't do use the area for a rectangle it's not a rectangle you can't use the area for triangle that's not a triangle you can't break this up in any way that you have geometric figures can you not even circles not even with radiuses because the radius is changing so the next question is can you find the area under a curve those are the two goals of calculus find the slope or the tangent of a curve at a point and secondly can you find the area under a curve between two points interesting stuff weird stuff right it's crazy questions going on here and amazingly it's actually not that hard uh this is I think it's easier than uh pre-calculus it's easier than that you don't have to do maybe not easier but if you know pre-calc this is not such reach what we're going to talk about first we're going to talk about the tangent problem I'll give a very intro to this but I'll talk about later on we're going to talk about this for most of our day today so let's talk about the tangent problem are you ready do you have any questions on the ideas of the goals of calculus do you understand what the goals are the goals are a find the tangent or the slope of a curve at a point that's what we want to do goal number two after we finish this we're going to move on to finding the area under a curve between two points very cool ideas so let's work on the tangent problem right that you you're lucky you're here today okay this is this this is like the fundamental idea of calculus this so cool we're going to figure out what a limit is from doing this idea right here too here's the tangent problem the tangent problem says if you give me any arbitrary curve so I'm just making up I don't even know what that that is it's just arbitrary curve and you give me a Point let's call that P give me a point call it P I want to be able to find the slope of that curve at Point P did you get the idea talking about the tangent problem right now right slope of that curve at that point because if we have the slope and we have the point we can make the equation of a tangent do you get me that's that's pretty easy that's just y - y1 = MX X1 so right now we have the point what we're worried about is the slope of the curve at that point do you follow now the problem is this um if we're going to make up a tangent line how many points do you need to make up a line how many points do we have that's the problem right how are you supposed to make the equation of a line when you only have one point and you don't know the slope yet do you see the issue that's the problem so here's what we're going to do we're going to say okay okay well let's let's put some point somewhere else on this thing how about uh Q up there if I connect these two things I connect those two things do you remember what what is called when you connect two points together it's not a tangent it's a genome it's a line if you've had some geometry a secant connects two parts of a well usually a circle but of any function so we would say that PQ is a secant line it touches two points of this curve now here's the question right you you agree that we need two points for a for a a line yes but we also agree that we want the tangent of Point P that's the ultimate goal here so my question to you is is PQ a good approximation for the tangent is this a good approximation for this okay it's an approximation right they're both positive okay sure what I'm asking you is is there way think about this for a second is there a way that I can make this secant approximation better to make it more approximate the tangent can I make this a better approximation how could I do it let's assume for a second that P is fixed but Q is movable you can move the point Q I can't move P but I can move the point Q can you move Q to make this seen line a better approximation to our tangent line can you think of that where would you move Q would you move it up would you move it down let's look what happens this is going to be interesting so we're going to find out what happens as we move Q down this line so if I move Q here is that better or worse better because I'm going to have use different colors here that this would be like Q sub one maybe a different point for Q uh if I move it closer is it going to get Better or Worse better okay if I move it closer it's going to get even better if I move it closer it's going to get even better if I move it closer it's going to get even better when do you stop can you move it really really close can you move it so q and P are the same point why not cuz then you only have one point how many points you need for line we need two so can we move it close answer is sure we're we're doing it right now can you move it close yes can you move so close that there's no difference between them yeah can you make it the same point no that would fail because we need two points I don't care how close they are but you need two different points right if you have two different points you can make the equation of a line that's great that'd be fantastic that's our idea actually so we're going to try to move the point Q really really really really really close to the point P if we can move it really really really really really close that's math speak by the way really really really really means very very very very if we can move really really really close then our secant line is going to be really really really really close to a tangent line do you agree with the idea so you take this point you go let's move a really close not really far away that's a sucky approximation but if we move it really close move that secant really close that point really close that secant is so close to a tangent line that it's not going to make a difference that's the idea so let me write some of the stuff out for you so what we're doing right here we need two points for a line sure we understand that awesome so we have the points p and Q well the question we're asking is what happens as Q gets closer to p and the answer is as Q gets closer to P but we just talked about this we just said this I'm nothing new as Q gets closer to P the secant line more closely approximates the tangent line now have you understood that at the first okay so as Q approaches I'm going to use that word we're going to use that word limits as well approaches that means gets closer to as qo approaches P we get closer to a tangent or in other words the secant more closely approximates the tangent okay well that's great that's great oh one more little note why was it that we can't just let Q equal p what what was the reason why can't we just say oh let's move it to P because there wouldn't be a difference okay there there wouldn't be two actual points to be the same point twice and that's that's a problem you couldn't make an equation of a line with that so one little note we can't just let Q equal p because we need two points to make a line you need two points that would be a problem here's the idea of a limit all right this is a big big idea here's the big big idea for limits okay the idea is how close can you get one point to another without them being the same point so let's say I have two points like this can you find some space between it let's say I move it over to the midpoint can you find some space between it say move it over to the midpoint can you find some space between it can you keep doing that for eternity between any two points there's there's a gap in that Gap you can fill it in with another point because points have no bread that means that even though we draw them on the board like this they really don't have any distance between them so two points can get would you agree infinitesimally close to each other that means so so close that you can't put anything between them but there're still some little distance and then you can get even closer that and closer that and closer that would you agree that to that so here's the idea behind calculus it says we can get Q so close to P that there's literally no difference between the secant and the tangent we can get it so close we can't let it equal but we can get it so close that the secant line is the same as the tangent line that's the idea of a limit isn't that kind of an interesting idea yes they're different points but they're so close it doesn't matter that's the whole idea so the the big big picture for our limits is if we let Q get really really really close to P the secet will be identical to a tangent that's the idea or approximate it so closely that it doesn't matter really really really if we let Q get really really really close to P I'll use a better word I'll use a more Mack word for that just a minute really really close to P the seant will be identical to the tangent here's the idea right here here's here's the idea now replace this really really really with with a key phrase for you the idea of really really really the idea of moving P or Q really really really close to P is called a limit moving something really really really close without actually getting there that's the idea of a limit you kind of understand the idea of a limit we would say that Q would be in a limiting position that means we we've got it all the way really as close as we can to P but it never touches P that's the idea of a limit it gets really really close so the idea of really really close is a limit in the most simple terms this is it would you like to see an example of how to actually do this would that be interesting to you how to find the so Curative point you want to see that it's kind of fun okay we're going to work through this um I'm I'm simply doing this to give you an understanding of how limits work and the jump that you can make okay uh we're not going to be doing a whole lot of math like this I'm just giving you an introduction right now so that you see it's possible with some real math stuff that you've had before without actually teaching you limits and calculus I'm going to make one limit jump in this problem I'll show you when it is uh but this is stuff that you could actually do we're just going to we're just going to use calculus to do it better you ready for it do it more mathematically before I go any further did you guys understand the tangent problem not your if you're okay with the tangent problem you understand the idea of a limit moving a point really close to but never actually getting there again why can't we get there need two points yeah that be okay cool now we're ready I'm excited first little step off into back this land do you trust me you shouldn't here's the goal to this problem I want us to find the equation of the tangent line to this curve at certain point specifically that one one one well let's go over to 1 one and let's put a point there so p is the .11 I'm going to walk you through how we're going to do this right now okay I'm going to walk you through how we're going to make up a tangent line using this idea are you ready for it over here on this idea we had two points right P set in stone you're not going to move P what other point do we have we're going to make a point q q what's the coordinates for Point Q tell me it's coordinates for Point Q two we can't use actual numbers right that would that would be very good so I I I know 24 would be on there and 39 would be on there 416 and so on but I want you use actual points in general what are the points for what are the coordinates for any point XY very good okay XY so now write down XY and have your eraser handy have your eraser handy because I'm not going to have X Y I want to keep this in terms of one variable Now using your your your knowledge of what the function is what's the function y equals what wa say again y equals what y equal so instead of having X comma y would it be okay with you if I had X comma X2 yes no cuz Y is x s right so that would't matter so erase that and I want you put X squ cool all right all right now we have this secant line going from P to q p is a fixed Point 11 one Q is a movable point x comma X2 would you agree that any point on this line will have the coordinates X comma X2 no matter what I plug in right so that that movable Point that's going to have the same coordinates all the way down now we have this secant line here's what we want to know we know that the equation for a line is y - y1 = m x - X1 true what we're trying to find is the equation for a tangent line here's what the equation for a tangent line would be pay close attention it would be y - y1 that's the same equals the slope but a specific slope it would be the slope of the tangent line true what if the tangent line slope happens to be so the slope of the tangent line and then x - X1 now the cool part about this I I'll I'll recap this in just a bit the cool part about this is we already have a point what's my fixed point that I have one one I already have one one so really what this comes down to is can you find the slope of the tangent that's why I said finding the slope of a curve at a point is the big deal for calculus you already have the point that's the easy part the slope is the hard part so we're going to try to find right now the slope of the tangent are you ready for it m yes you sure we're going to use the idea of SL of a secant so we're going to take a break right now we're going to come back to this uh in case you're just a little bit lost here's what we've done so far this is y Square I gave it to you we fixed one point according to my problem that's 1 one we've made up another point a movable Point q q is that X comma x s where did the X squ come from that's cuz it's y all right great we now know the equation of a line is this so therefore the equation of a tangent line would be the same exact equation it's just we'd have the slope of the tangent line the problem is it's very hard to find the slope of a tangent line without doing the limiting idea you can't do it because there's only one point there so we're going to have to use the idea of a secant and make it into a tangent line by moving Q really close to P do you get the idea basically doing that with this problem so let's take a look at the slope of a secant our specific secant hey by the way do you remember the slope in general the slope formula slope is what over what okay great in terms of our coordinates slope is Delta y Delta X specifically in terms of our coordinates what is our slope that's what I'm looking for Y 2 y1 yeah over X2 - X1 otherwise you get the the negatives of that slope so Y2 - y1 X2 - X1 do you follow how people feel okay with this so far just slope formula what we're going to do we're now going to find the slope of our secant we've got the secant on the board right the secant will be the slope I'm sorry the slope of the secant will be the slope from points P to Q agree let's plug in these coordinates we only have on the board plug in these coordinates into that formula in our case our Y2 is what our Y2 would be x s what's our y1 not X be one what's our X2 what's our X1 okay Y2 - y1 over X2 - X1 not if you're okay with that so what we'd have for the slope of our secant is Y2 - y1 over X2 - X1 are you okay with this so far find out where the slope comes from there's a couple notes I want to make at this point first I'm reiterating a lot of stuff here I know that I am I'm doing on purpose CU these are the key points of calculus all right you need to understand what we're doing I would hate for you to get through this C class right and at the end of it know how to take derivatives and integrals and have no idea what you're doing you can be successful on just doing derivatives and integrals in this classroom but if you don't understand what it is you're actually doing with those things you don't even know what they are right now but if you don't understand what you're doing it's irrelevant you're just now just doing formulas it sucks if you know what it comes from what you're actually doing I I'm going to make sure you know by the way it's a little bit more interesting and you can apply it to more things do you get the picture so right here what we're doing step number one is if we move Q close to P this is going to become this do you agree as P I'm sorry as Q I'm going to use a new symbol here approaches P that means as Q gets really close to P without touching the slope of the secant line approaches the slope of the tangent line would you agree with that statement that's over here right now you you agreed with it already haha tricking uh as Q gets close to P the secant gets close to the tangent true that's that's what this says right now okay as Q gets close to P the secant gets close to the tangent how close it depends on how close we get these things if we get them so close it doesn't matter then these become so close it doesn't matter agreed it's kind of neat right it's a cool idea now the the problem is here's here's note number one here's note number two this is interesting right where are we trying to find the slope what point one one one well and what's the x coordinate for one one to find the slope of anywhere you you plug in that value right this gives you the slope of the secant line true plug in one plug in one what happens no you don't get zero you get zero over 0 over zero is not zero that's a big problem 0 over Z 0 over Z is undefined right isn't that an issue this is why folks this is the reason why why you cannot have the point getting listen you can't get Q close to P because if you plug in one it's undefined that means that you're you you have the same point so you can't let X = 1 that's big time that means double important you can't let x equal one this is why we can't let Q equal p because we only have one point right you can't find the slope it fails it's undefined at that point this is why Q can will be if it does if you try to find SL of the SE at that point move Q all the way down and then plug in the x coordinate if it's the same thing you're going to get something that's undefined because you're trying to find the difference between points that don't exist a difference that doesn't exist and that's going to be you're divided by zero the there's no difference on the x axis that would mean you're dividing by zero you get something that's undefined you get an undefined slope that's a bad thing so we can't let Q get all the way to P true all right what can we do now this is going to blow your mind you ready to get your minds blowing like a mind grenade you ever seen Yes Man watch yes man so funny had a rib bull you have a rib bull let's go rle have you not seen it that just sounded really stupid you watch yes man it's pretty funny now so next part going to blow your mind can you factor that in fact learning what we knew about ASM stuff like that you know that if you have 0 over Z it's factorable because of well some stuff in mathematics that I haven't bored you with yet but if you ever have uh the some number that that makes zero it means that that's a factor if you have some number the same number that makes two polinomial zero it means they have a common factor we've got a common factor here in fact if you were to factor this this is going to give you x + 1 x -1 over x - one agreed okay do you think see anything that simplifies out of that aha now this is cool now this this is interesting very interesting what we're going to do is we're going to be able to simplify out this thing now I know what you're thinking well wait a second can't you not simplify out a domain issue isn't that a problem for you and the answer is yes no it would be a problem normally however watch carefully are we actually letting equal 1 is Q actually getting to the point p no so is X actually equaling one no we're getting really really close I'm talking like 1.000000 forever and then a little bitty one at the very end of it really close but it's never actually equaling one so keep in mind when we do this we're not getting rid of any do we're not really altering the domain whatsoever because we already knew X wasn't equal 1 so we have this little restraint already X isn't going to equal one so then what we know is okay the SL of the secant now equals x + 1 were there any questions on this because I got to eras it do you have any anything all right is this making sense to you do you see where the slope formula came from do you see how we can factor and simplify it and now we get down to here we don't have any problems we not eliminating domain issue because we're actually not letting X get equal to one it's just getting really close to it here's the jump that we're going to make okay here's the jump so that was true that's what we have down what I'm asking you is as Q gets closer to P so basically as X gets closer to one uh what happens as Q is closer to P that means the X variable is getting closer to one as X gets closer to one can you tell me what happens to the value of the secant let's try some okay think about this for a second just just do a little bit of math with me let's say we started at the point uh 416 so X would now be four plug in four here how much would you get okay now let's move it down to three plug in three here what would you get move it down to two how much would you get okay move it down to 1.5 how much did you get 2.5 move it down to 1.3 what would you get move it down to 1.1 what would you get move it down to 1.01 what would you get. 2.01 good move down to 1.001 what would you get move down to 1. Z forever and then a little one at the end what would you get 2.0 forever little one wouldn't you would you say that as this thing gets closer to one the slope of our secant gets closer to two would you say that because I'm plugging in things really close to one I'm going to get out things that are plus one really close to two does that does that make sense to you our sequence would be really close to two here's what that says this lets us make the jump this is a limiting position it says that we know the limit of the slope of the seant line is two what that means for us is that the slope of the tangent line actually is two that's the jump it says the secant line at this point if x gets super super close really really close if x gets really really close to one the seant line gets really really close to two now I can't let x equal 1 but I can make the jump that if I could let x equal to one the slope would be two that's the jump there do you guys see the jump this is the the using limits to make the jump between a secant and a t tangent so because the secant's approaching two we say okay we got this that's called a limit we're going to talk more about limits later on but the jump is going from here to here now can you fill out this equation using that information sure we know that it would be y - y1 which is 1 equals the slope of the tangent hey we know it's 2 X - 1 now of course we don't generally leave things in point slope will solve them do you see where the one the one and the two are coming from folks M our point is 1 one our slope is now two that's the slope of the tangent if we solve it we get y - 1 = 2x - 2 add the one y = 2x - 1 that's the slope of a curve at a freaking Point that's awesome oh my gosh Isn't that cool we just found the first tangent line to a curve that you've done now granted it's not a very hard curve but here's what it is I I'll show it to you you can actually graph it here's - one it crosses there you go up 2 one two over one oh that's the point and if I graph it it intersects at only one spot that's it that's a tangent line isn't that awesome your mind should be blowing is that why you're looking at me stunned like yeah is that your stunned face it should be your stunned face okay now by show hands after 40 minutes of doing one example how many people are we talked about good you have down right now now the basic idea for calculus this is the basic idea using limits to find this tangent of a curve at a point is it going to get more advanced in this yes of course it is but that's the basic idea and we're going to do things differently when we actually get to the calculus we study limits more first but we we will get there now the the next thing we got to talk about is the different problem I'm going to I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time on I'm basically just going to introduce it to you cuz I I know for sure you guys are not going to remember this uh by the time we actually get to areaid curve so I'm going to to re introduce it to you again but for right now I want you to just get the idea about what's going to happen later on okay so the area problem here's the area problem are problem says can you find the area under a curve between two points the answer is yes you can with Calculus only how are we supposed to do this thing and let limits work for us here here's the the plan uh firstly can you find the area the way it is right now no it's got a curve to it you can't find areas with curves in them so so what maybe would be an idea you can approximate it by making it like a rectangle oh I could yeah sure if I did this and said okay from here I just want to make a rectangle would that be an approximation mhm would it be a good approximation no not really however what if I did okay I don't want just one rectangle maybe I do this I say okay I want a rectangle from here to here then a rectangle from here to here then one from here to here here and went from here to here is that a better approximation the missing area is smaller yes that's the idea behind the area problem what we're going to be doing is making rectangles why rectangles well let me ask you can you find the area of a rectangle that's why rectangles and they're easy to draw we like that so if we make lots and lots and lots of little itty teeny bitty weeny little rectangles like that all the same width but going the entire length of our our curve and we add up all those rectangles are we going to have a pretty good approximation of the area and in fact if we make those rectangles infinitesimally small so whereas you couldn't even slip a piece of paper between them and then add them up is that going to be even better in fact if we stuck an infinite number of rectangles between this point and this point which you can do with limits we're going to have a perfect area and that's the idea for the area problem you stick an infinite number of rectangles in there and add them up it's going to involve limits because we're letting some number go to Infinity you can't ever reach infinity but a limit will take care of that for you that's the idea behind the area problem does it make sense kind of the idea of the rectangles trust me we'll get much more involved later you have no idea how to do this right now don't worry about it okay we're not even to do a problem we'll do that later chapter four or something like that so let's define a limit uh what a limit says in English is what does the function do as a variable approaches a given value that's what it says in English so limits what does the function do as the variable approaches a given value that's the question now do we care what happens to the function at that value the answer is no the limit isn't about getting to the actual point it's about what happens as you're approaching that point getting really really close you see the difference there in the previous example we couldn't actually get to one do you remember why some of you're zoning you're zoning out can't have one point on the line we'd also make a a undefined point right it be undefined that would be bad but we we saw what happens when we get really close the function got really close to something else that's the idea of a limit so we don't care what happens as you get to the value what happens as you approach the value um for us this is this is exactly what we did actually kind of in our heads what happens what happens to X2 as X approaches let's do two that's X approaches two I could written in English but that's just as valid what happens as X approaches two now do we care what happens if you plug in two no don't care what I care about is what's going to happen if I draw this table right here with X and F ofx and I say I'm trying to get to two I don't care what that value is what I'm trying to see is what the function is doing as I'm getting close to that thing so what's happening as we approach it from the right what's happening as you approach it from the left give me oh I already ruined it give me some numbers uh to the right of two two numbers to the right three give me something smaller than three like 2.5 is I like that that's what I was about to write almost ruined it give me something a little bit closer to two closer than that maybe 2.1 yeah or 2.01 we want really close right so 2 .1 and it maybe 2.1 that's pretty close take your calculator out by the way now let's go the other way give me a number that's smaller than two that we want to work our way up from this way okay sure how about we we keep it kind of symmetrical 1.5 I like that one we'll do uh 1.9 all right and 1.999 how about that do that work for you take those numbers our function's x s let's look what happens to the function as we plug those things in if you plug in 2.5 what do you get when you 6.25 or something like that plug in 2.5 you get 6.25 yeah okay so we'd start with 6.25 what we care about is does this side look at the look at the board if we go this way and we go this way do they meet up at the same point that's what we're talking about for limits now this is a very very easy example we just were working with X2 we know the answer is going to be four right Le it should be four we're going to see if that actually happens when we when we evaluate our limits plug in 2.1 someone out there tell me what you get when you plug in 2.1 what you 4.41 okay that's Clos to four tell me what you get when you plug in 2.1 2. wait what is it 4.41 how that like that how about 1.5 oh that's that's 225 isn't it how about 1.9 plug in 1.9 what do you get when you do that X S6 36 and now do 1.999 1.999 what do you get how much 3.96 34960 one M yeah okay cool what's going on here let's see with the limit we really don't care about what happens at two because a lot of times what you're going to find out is that we deal with limits where you can't get to that number cuz it for some reason it's undefined like our slope problem we just had okay so we're trying to figure out what's happening from the right and from the left and seeing if those are going heading towards the same exact value are they we're going from six down to four down to 44 where's this heading where's this heading it's heading towards four what we would say right now how you write it couple notes about this uh the function must approach the same value from both the left and the right so this is from the right this is from the left the function must approach the same value from the left and the right for the limit to exist if it does here's how you write the limit what you do is you put a little limb undercase which kills me because I can only write in capitals so you put the limit you put the variable you're working with you put that little arrow which I already told you is a approaching and you put the value to which X is approaching X is this one where are we where are we trying to get to on our X we're trying to find out what happens around the point xals 2 does that make sense to you so You' say the limit as X approaches two of your function what was our function say it again x s the limit as X approaches 2 of our function is equal to what did it what did the function approach here's what this says in English okay look at the board what does the function approach as the value X approaches two what's the function approach as X approaches two what's two that's the liit in general we have uh we have this this will be the last bit we had a limit of a function is equal to some number that's what capital L is that would stand for the limit of this function as X approaches a it's what the function is tending to do from both sides as X approaches one single value um the only thing that we we uh we need to know is the limit really doesn't depend on getting to a right X is never going to equal a X never gets a we just care about what's happening to the value of the function as X is getting really close to a from both sides up here on the board what's happening to the function as X is getting really really close to a from both sides it's getting really really close to four that's the idea of limit how many people understand the idea of a limit cool next time we work on how to find some limits all right so if you remember from last time we're talking about limits and what we're realizing is that a limit basically says or asks the question what is the function doing what's the value of the function doing as X approaches a certain number now do we ever care what happens when X gets to that number as far as a limit is concerned no no not really just what's the function doing where's it getting close to as we're getting close to that x value and that's that's the idea here so when we're talking about the limit of x -1 x^2 -1 that's our function we want to find out what happens as X approaches one now why can't I figure out what happens when x equals 1 tell me that your denominator zero that would be undefined right as a matter of fact it makes both a numerator and denominator zero and that would still be undefined uh we found out that that's is that a hole or an ASM toote do you remember a that's a hole that's going to be a hole ultimately this function has a whole so what we want to find out though is what's the function doing as we approach that certain value now one way we we figured out the only way we figured out these limits is to make up a table and this is kind of the elementary way that you discover limits right when you first learned now towards the end of the day I'll teach you some better ways on how to do this for right now though I want you to see what happens with the function with the limit so when you are finding these and your homework is going to ask you for that find the the limit of this function by making a table of when you do that you have your x value on the the top you have your FX values on the bottom in this case x -1- 1 and you start with the number you want to find the the limit of the the number where that you want to find the limit of the function where where X is approaching that certain value put that in the middle so for instance you're going to put one right there and really I don't want to know what that is because you can't plug it in anyway what we want to find out is what's happening from both sides is it going to the same value you follow me on this so what you need to do now put these numbers in order because it is a number line you don't want to have like I see a lot of mistakes on this I see a lot of people do this okay well I'm going to start at two and I'm going to go to 1.5 and then I'm going to go to 1.1 then I'm going to go to 1.1 right do you see how that's the wrong way to do it that that's going to show you One Direction but it's the wrong direction you need to have these numbers reversed so that this is just a little bit past one we're coming from the right hand side so if you want to find out where it's coming from don't don't have two right here have two over there somewhere if you're going to do that all right so these numbers that we have next to one they should actually be the numbers that are close to one all right not the other way around that are you following that now have you're okay with that so we don't want to have the the smallest numbers over here that are the ones that are closest to one over there we want this just like a number line would look so here maybe we do start with 1.5 1.01 1.001 make it really close to one now the other way I'll probably want to start with 0. five right I want to make it symmetrical at least a little bit so where's 0 five going to go is it going to go by the one or over here on the left hand side left side left hand side I want the numbers are really closest to one well the closest to one that's going to show me the trend so 0.5 May be99 and 999 what I'd like you to do right now on your own take out your calculator find those numbers uh how about this the people to the see this is your left the people to the left side of the camera do these ones okay people to the right side of the camera do those ones can you do that for me so plug them into the function tell me what you're getting out I know there's a way to do this on t have you started to find those numbers does anybody have uh this one yet 66 continu does everyone get that one same one 6.66 so 6.67 how about the. N9 D we find that one 0. N9 52 can I get a double check on that 5 how much3 5 how about for this one that's that right one let's double check that one 099 minus one that should be pretty small you know negative something uh one more double check what' you say it was at five and then the first one 66 66 is your calculator scientific notation by chance no once you guys figure out your stuff all right I'll come back to y'all this side try this side can you give me 1.5 how much4 can you give me 1.01 497 how much 497 497 0497 take it okay can you give me uh 1.001 please 1.1 499 499 okay H interesting I'm guessing the six was probably not not all that accurate let's try that again was scient ah so6 okay give me N9 what 503 give me n99 52 now do you see the the trend to which this function is is is getting close to can you see it what number is it getting close to from the right what number is it getting close to from the left that's why you put it in this order so you can see where it's approaching from the left and from the right if it's the same number if this is getting to 0 five and that's getting to 0 five you'd say okay that limit exists and that limit is 0.5 are you following me on this so the the limit right here would be5 and that's how you use a table to figure that out now of course this was a pretty mind numbing task right who wants to plug in 1.001 and do all this for for a whole bunch of numbers do you want to do that no I want to do that either because it's boring right we're going to find some better ways to do these limits in the next section for right now though I need you to get understand what a limit is a limit asks what's the function the value the function do as you get closer as your x value gets closer to that what's the function's value do what's the functions value do as your x value gets closer to that from both the left and the right if it's to the same number the limit exists and it's that number right you okay with this so far now are there ever cases when the limit doesn't exist for a number I want you to look at this all right we're going to talk about something called one-side limits and the question is what's the limit as X approaches to of FX now what we've had on the board already is what's called a right-sided limit and a left sided limit you have this kind of intuitive idea right in order for a limit to exist it's got to go there from both sides does that make sense to you it's got to get there from both sides for limit to exist so from the left and from the right has to be the same number I want you to look at this thing which way would be from the right over here or over here option one or option two one from the right would be this way true we can actually have right and left sided limits so here's how you write that a right sided limit in our case it would be a limit of our function as X approaches whatever value you're talking about in this case we're talking about the value two do you guys see where the two is coming from in this case we want to find out when X approaches two and how you say from the right hand side is you put a little superscript plus that means from right so in general you'd have this you'd have a limit of FX as X approaches a some number that I give you from the right that says a right sided one-sided right sided limit not your have be okay with that so plus means from the right you all all right with the plus meaning from the right what do you think a left side of Li is going to happen oh you guys are geniuses exactly yeah Left sided limit would be a limit of f ofx sure as X approaches a certain number in our case our certain number is two and that little minus or negative is from the left in general we'd have the same situation only from the left so let me ask you a question can you find the limits both right sided and left sided of this function let's try that together here's what the the question I'll go nice and soow so you can understand it here's what the question asks what is the value of the function as X approaches two from the right for right side and from the left from the left side okay so follow follow the function law I need you to tell me what what the height of my finger is what's the height of my finger when I get really close to this value along this line so this is from am I going from the right or the left in this case from the right from the right okay that it's always from the it's not to the it's from the right so from the right the height of my finger is okay I'm a little above a little above one what's the height of my finger going towards as I slow down I'm slowing down what's the height of my finger trying to get to it's trying to get to one do you see that it's not that my finger's getting close it's not the the limit's going to be two it's saying what happens to the value of the function the value is your y AIS what's happening to the value of the function or the height of my finger as my finger is approaching in this direction the number two does that make sense to you so here the height of my finger is trying to get to one as I'm approaching two from the left the right that's what I said from the right I'll edit that out you won even know beep just kidding I'm not going to edit that it's going to be on there forever yeah so from the right so from the right it's going to be approaching one yeah thanks for that you okay with that being one it's either yes or no if you're not that's okay but I need to know I need to have a question from you if you're not are you guys okay with the height of that being one as this function's approaching an x value of two so basically you're asking what's the Y value when you reach your x value okay okay we could see you what's your yv value when you reach your x value so now we're going to do from the left hand side what's the height of my finger aka the Y value as I approach the x value of two so what am I doing where am I getting close to as I'm getting to two from the left hand side what am I getting close to negative 1 yeah absolutely now here's a little note here's a little note for you in order for a limit to exist at a point the left side limit must equal the right side limit if it doesn't then the limit doesn't exist does that make sense to you it's got to go to the same place otherwise limit doesn't exists you can be one-sided sure here here but if it's not the same spot then you'd say overall the limit the limit means from both sides the general limit means from both sides so if it's not going to the same thing that limit doesn't exist so let me write that out for you and I'll explain it for a limit to exist at a point we'll call it a for a limit to exist to a in other words for this to happen for you to be able to say the limit as X approaches a is some number for that to happen you must have this the limit of x f ofx as X approaches a from the left must be equal to the limit of f ofx as X approaches a from the right it's got to happen so let's see if that Happ what this says in plain English is this you ready for the plain English part here's the plain English the function from the left and the function from the right have to have the same value basically they've got to meet up somewhere you with me on that so let's check this out does the function from the right and the function from the left meet up what do you think do those lines meet up they do they meet up they come to the same point same value same height well let's see this limit was one this limit was negative 1 is one the same as negative 1 no so does the both the one-sided limits have the same value no you'd say this limit does not exist so we'd say the limit as X approaches 2 of f ofx does not exist this says why this says the limits from the left and the limit from the right must be the identical number you remember this example look up here on the board remember this example he you said the limit existed because that's five and that's five basically it's coming to 05 you with me on that what if this was 05 and that was seven would that be the same number no this one's one this one's negative one is that the same number that limit doesn't exist okay it says you have to have the same function value on both the left and the right both would you like another example of this sure yeah why not as well have time let's practice okay let's let's get some good practice if you're not getting it I need some questions out of you because you really do have to understand this before we go any further so here's the idea in order to find the limit at a certain value in this case we're going to talk about two again do you see why that would be the interesting case here I want to break it down to you all right if I asked for the the limit of three it's not very interesting because look it here's the value of three does the limit exist at that point answer's clearly yes at three at three yeah look it the function's there the function's there the function's there it's all the same do you get me on that that's not an interesting example that's boring that just says the function is completely there therefore the limit must exist from the right and from the left you're coming to the same exact point do you get me on that that's not interesting if I ask you about two though that's more interesting you need to be able to find the limit from the right and the limit from the left as we're approaching an x value of two in math that means this can you do this can you do this and can you determine this let's see if you can let's see if you can I'm going to give you about 5 Seconds between each each problem to see if you can get it okay so right now I want you to determine on your own can you tell me don't say out loud okay let everyone do this can you determine on your own the limit of G ofx as X approaches 2 from the right do it on your own don't say loud give up five seconds the question in English asks this what is the Y value when X gets really close to two from the right that's what the question asks what is the function value or the Y value when X get really close to two from the right well that was like four people answering do you all not know it or do you know it know it if you don't know it then that's fine but you need to tell me if you know it then say it uh can you find out that the function value the Y value is about three or is getting close to three when X is getting close to two can you see that cuz you're following this along right you're going okay what's happening as I'm getting close to the value two along the X the Y is getting close to three so this is how much okay now I want you to do this on your own don't say loud again uh find me the limit of G of X as X approaches two from the left write it down in your paper don't say it loud from the left basically in English that says what's the Y value when the x value is getting close to two from the left starting from the left what is it one one one did you all get one how many were able to find one good okay here's how you tell if the limit exists or not here's how you tell you look at these ones are they the same you sure yeah one's three ones1 I mean how how much more sure can you be if those aren't the same does that exist if those are the same does that exist yeah I want you to know something really cool too about limits does it matter at all that that point was right in the middle of nothing we don't care about that point we don't care at two We Care what's happening to the function as we're getting close to that you see the difference I don't care about that it could as well not even be there it doesn't matter we don't care about that point we care about the function value the Y value as we approach the x value so if this does not equal that does that exist you put D you can really see it though can't you if the if the lines don't match up it's not there it's not going to happen the limit doesn't exist let's do one more and we'll call a good on this stuff um here we go for okay last picture last picture for us I want you to try to do that one completely on your own okay this is H of X I want you to find the limit of H of X is Xtra Clos 5 from the right I want you to find the limit of H of X as X approaches 5 from the left and then I want you to determine whether or not that limit exists at xal 5 you should follow the questions okay go ahead and do that see what you get for oh oh let's see if we did it right okay so the limit of of our function as we're going from the right as we going from the left and then we're going to compare those numbers so from the right means from the positive or from the more positive I should say because sometimes both positive from the left means uh from the less positive or negative whatever your case may be so from the right from the left from the right what is the Y value as your x value approaches five what are you getting towards okay well what about that one does the function actually approach that approach it see that's a difference we don't care what it is at that number we care what it's approaching as we're getting close to that number you see the difference right okay so you all got how much perfect let's do it from the left from the left what's the the Y value getting towards as your x value is getting towards five good is the right side of limit the same as the left side of limit does the limit exist absolutely yeah why don't care what happens to that point just because this point doesn't fill in that hole it doesn't matter as long as the functions values go to the same exact spot from both sides do we care what happens when we get there no we don't care about that we care about this that limit is three how many people have a better idea about the idea of a limit right now so given a a graph you can do this okay cool hey let's talk about that for a second what's the one number you can't plug into that Z what would happen if we discovered what what the function does as we approach zero isn't that an interesting question it's kind of cool kind of what happens to the function as we get close and close to that let's talk about that for a second now in order to talk about that we need limits what's the function do as we approach that so just like we did over here we're going to talk about a right sided and a left-sided limit but we're going to do with a table now what number are we approaching I'm sorry what was it where's the zero go on our table to the left to the right or in the middle because that's the number we're trying to get to are we ever going to be able to get to the zero now we can't plug it in because then it's undefined that would be a problem so now let's pick some numbers that are getting close to Zero from the right let's start at like oh I don't know 0.5 and we'll work our way down so 0. five is 0.5 supposed to go here or here the right or the left so five all right 01 and 01 would you agree those are numbers that are pretty close to zero right uh what are the numbers to the left of zero what do you want to use the same ones but negative okay good they have to be negative though because they left to zero so5 that'll work And1 And1 so let's use those numbers again left side people do the left side right side people do the right side these one should be a little bit easier to plug in yeah little bit by the way this is going a little bit out of the scope of this section at this point we're talking about something a little ahead of time uh it's interesting to me so we're we're covering this right now it will come back at us uh later on right but I'd like to make sure you see it in limits at least once or twice before we get to that section so if you take one and you divide P5 I'm hoping that you got two did you get two and over here you probably got well I'm going to be a genius about that -2 did you get2 genus no so okay good I scared myself for a second so two and-2 very good uh now how about 01 if you divide one by 01 you should get let's see move the decimal place you should get and I'm going to hope this is 00 yes if you divide by 01 that's let's see 1 2 three decimal places you're just dividing one by decimal places there ending into one that should be let's do a little critical thinking here all right first question is is this number getting bigger or smaller as we're approaching Zero from the right is it ever going to stop getting bigger 1 divided 000000001 is going to be really really really really really big right and it's going to be positive how about this way is it getting bigger or smaller way smaller and it's never going to stop getting smaller it's not going to a certain number now first the second question is does the limit exist are they going to the same exact number No in fact as we're going from the right where would you say this is going because if you draw the picture it's going like like that it's going where INF Infinity if you divide by smaller and smaller numbers that are approaching zero keep dividing by 00 forever and then little one you're going to get really really huge numbers right and you can keep getting smaller and smaller still so what we would say is the limit as X approaches zero from the right of our function which is 1 /x is positive infinity and you you technically don't have to put the plus because Infinity without that plus still means positive Infinity but I want to show the difference limit as you approach it I'm sorry X approaches zero from the left is what would you say that would be is negative Infinity the same thing as positive Infinity so limit clearly doesn't exist in fact you can see this from the graph if you graph one of Rex your calculator whatever you you graph it on look like this that's it you can see as we get towards zero it's skyrocketing as we get towards zero it's really going into Abyss right so it's it's not going to be the same thing but this leads us to a couple ideas whenever we have a limit I'll write this up for you if you have a limit as X approaches a from either the right or the left of some function and you figure out that it's positive or negative Infinity say it again if you are approaching a number right from either the right or from the left and it's going to Infinity either positive or negative what that does for you is it gives you an what's this thing called gives you an ASM toote gives you an ASM toote because you say okay if we're going towards Infinity as we're reaching as if my yv values going to Infinity as my x value reaches a number that means I have to be shooting up if my y Valu is go to negative Infinity as I reach a certain number that means I have to be shooting down so one of those cases it's going to be some sort of ASM toote you're never going to actually get to that point you can't you can't so uh there are really four cases I'll draw them over there so we see them four cases of of asmp tootes and the relationships to their limits for so one case is what happens if we approach a from the right and we're going to positive Infinity another case would be what happens if we approach a from the right and we go to negative Infinity another case would be well what would happen if we went we did the both rights right from the right if we went to a from the left and went to positive infinity or what would happen if we went to a from the left and it gave us negative Infinity would you agree those are all four permutations all four cases of of this in either case we just talked about this if your function is going to positive NE Infinity when X is going to a from the left or the right you're going to have an ASM toote so every one of these is going to be an ASM toote well that's the worst ASM toote I've ever drawing GL to experience second not let's kind of diagnose what these things would do I want you to really think of what these limits should do to our our function here okay now if I say x is approaching a from the right should I start here or start this way am I going this way option one or this way option two option one so if the function's approaching a from the right and it goes to positive Infinity should I be going up or should I be going down so this would be this type of graph it can do whatever it wants over here no problem but when it gets to here it shoots up this is not going to be this isn't going to be told by our limit as we approach a all right has nothing to do with it it's what happens as we get close to a it's going to be going towards positive let's let's talk about this one now I know we were just coming from the right hand side this one's going to be going well not up not positive Infinity it's going to be going down negative Infinity do whatever you want over here but it's going to drop it's going to be ASM totic to that that line how about this one can you picture what that one does in your head already draw a graph if you want to right now you should be able to draw something with that are we going option one from the right or option two from the left from the left and should we be going up or down which one it's going to positive Infinity up or down up lastly the only case we have left is from the left going down to negative infinity looks something like that would you raise your hand if you feel okay with what we've talked about so far today all right that takes care of kind of our introduction to limits we talked a little bit about that now for the rest of our day I'm going to teach you how to compute limits because if you had noticed this this isn't all that fun I'm going to show you some better ways on how to do that would you like to learn that cool any questions before you go on the same ex the limit would exist yes it would so if we have a one side limit this way and once that limit that way and they both go to positive Infinity yeah sure we'd say the limit is positive Infinity because it goes from both sides or if the limit is going both negative Infinity that would exist so let's see this way yes this way yes this way no this way no it takes practice to do that by the way I showed you that already just one question about this one yeah um it's approaching from the right should should approaching from the left this one no the one above this one this is approaching from the right going to negative Infinity oh I see the plus now oh never mind yeah you know what let me write that out too um if this and this do you see the this the thing here if we go from the right and from the left and they both go to positive Infinity then this was your question yes sure if the two if this works all the time if the left side limit and the right side limit go to the same thing the limit exists uh you could substitute in if this is going to negative infinity and negative Infinity that would be negative Infinity so you can draw that that Corr as well good question any other thank for that one any other questions before we continue all right let's compute some limits you got that 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 1.2:  Properties of Limits.  Techniques of Limit Computation
we got to start with some Basics is that 1.2 or 2. 1.2 we're skipping the chapter and I I was going we're in trouble now yeah I'd like you to read the rest of chapter one you know just kind of get it and then we'll be on suck some teachers do that I've heard anyway no we're 1.2 my bad I I saw I just like the number two so I thought I'd put it up there on the board see what happens you know we're going to have to start with some Basics some Basics that we know are truths and then we'll be able to figure out some properties use those properties to discover how to compute some limits so first little basic here the limit as X approaches a of a constant C or C is a constant what's the picture what's the graph of a constant show them with your hands with the picture of a sure yeah exactly what is it yeah what's the picture of a constant of of a function equal in a constant yeah it's not this way right it's this way that's a constant it doesn't doesn't change slope wise the slope is zero it just goes straight across true so if I were to draw the picture of this you would agree that that would be my function right well here's the cool thing if I take the limit at any point any point whatsoever so for instance here's my a here's my a I I just picked a random point doesn't matter what it is okay it's arbitrary what's the limit as we go from the left and the right firstly is it the same thing yeah it's not not gapped or anything it's going to the same thing uh what's the limit as we go from the right what's the what's the Y value as we approach the a value c c how about this way so the limit is what that means is the limit of a constant is the constant itself that's cool where C's a constant that's nice right that makes sense graphically we just kind of interpreted so every time we take a limit of just a number that's a constant we just have the constant that makes things nice for us number two how about the limit of X as X approaches a so uh what's the the graph of just X like yal X how's that look line that passes through the origin it goes through the origin great because the slope would be one and the Y intercept would be zero so this is just if you show me with your hands how would it look yeah just like that not like this not like this but a diagonal now I'm going to pick another arbitrary point a the question is if this is yal X just our our diagonal line if you plug in a to y x what do you get out of it yeah you get out a true you plug in two you get out two you plug in three you get out three you plug in four you get out four you with me on that so my question is as we approach as X approaches a from the right and from the left what's the Y approach from the right and from the left a it approaches a so from the right our function the Y value is going towards a true from the left the y- value is going towards a does the limit exist it's the same from left and right and it's equal to how much cool so here's one here's two says the limit this is really interesting it says the limit of a very like X just just a simple function like this is the same thing as if I were to just plug that number in so if if I'm taking the the limit of some function x uh at at some point a the answer is just a that's it that's kind of nice right why because graphically we can see that last one amazingly with with this stuff uh we'll be able to do everything else it's kind of cool this I'm just going to write it out because we just covered it a second ago this is why we covered a second ago how much is the limit of 1 /x as X approaches zero from the left hand side it was on the board just a couple minutes ago how much is that very good negative Infinity how much is the limit of 1x as X approach to Z from the right hand side what was that now last thing we're going to do firstly are you okay with these three basics okay these two this one we already knew these two are kind of interesting they're really unique and we're going to use those to solve some limits here in just a bit to evaluate some limits I should say before we do that though I got to tell you the properties of limits we're going to leave at that for today and I'll show you how to apply these next time so so basic properties we're going to assume that we have two functions and that the limits exist for each one so the limit of f ofx as X approaches a exists the limit of G of x as X approaches a exists notice notice please that these limits are that the x is going approaching the same exact value you see that the a is the same it's got to be the same for this really to work okay so it's got to be the same approach M I just made that word up I don't s got to push same same number here's your properties there's basically five things we can do they're all quite interesting first one this is why both of those have to exist is because we're going to do this if you have a limit you're not going to see why this is really interesting until next time so make sure you come back on Friday uh if you have a limit where you have a function inside of it added to another function no matter what that function is you can separate that function so for instance you can do the limit as X approaches a of f ofx plus the limit as X approaches a of G of X that's legal you can separate limits by addition it's kind of neat right by the way this is why you had to have the same letter here because we we have to do that and you can also combine them that's legal to do as well so these are not oneway streets um let's see I'm going to make this a little bit easier for us I'm not write the second one I just need you to know that this works for addition and subtraction that than nice it also works for multiplication you can separate limits by multiplication so that's legal to do you can also separate them by division which means if you have limit as x appr a of FX GX that's the same thing as the limit of f ofx over the limit of G of x that's true but you have to have something what can't this equal you can't have that so the limit of G ofx cannot be zero last one the one that I find the most interesting this is really cool I know we're a minute or two over sorry about that uh if you have the limit raised to some power some function raised to a power this is the coolest one you're going to see why in next time but you can actually do this this makes it so you can do a limit of the function and then raise it to the power that's a neat one that means that you can remove an exponent from your function with limits that's very cool uh what's what's fascinating about this is it even works with this because that is an exponent right a radical is an exponent you can remove a radical I'm going to leave it like that uh you can take a radical outside of your limit going go we're going to do many examples of those things but have those written down we'll start with that next time well if you remember from last time what we're talking about is limits and I I think the last thing I did leave you with was the properties of limits and there's a few things that we can do with our limits now now one thing we knew was that from our basic limits our little bases up there the limit of a constant equals that constant that was real nice also the limit of just a simple variable like x equal whatever the X was approaching that that number so those are the two Basics I gave you and then I gave you some properties basically with our properties it says you can split up limits by addition you can split up limits by subtraction you can split up limits by multiplication you can also do it with division as long as the limit of the denominator is not zero you can also this is the coolest one I think anytime you have a function taken to a power inside of a limit you can take a limit of the function and then take the power afterwards so that means you can really alleviate the problem of having an exponent within any limit are you ready to see how we can do that to to evaluate that limit without doing those silly like check a two in the middle and then find out from the left and from the right remember doing those right those tables we don't want to do that anymore we want to use the properties and our basis for limits to be able to solve this thing you ready to do it so here's what we can do if we look at this thing and say okay limit as X approaches two of this function the first thing I know is that I can separate limits by addition and subtraction you with me so what this says is okay well this can become the limit as X approaches 2 of X Cub minus the limit as X approaches 2 of 2x plus the limit as X approaches 2 of s now a lot of people are going to ask do I have to put the limit as X approaches two every time yes yes you have to do it it's like uh it's like asking someone to take the absolute value you have to write absolute value until you AB actually take the absolute value of something so you have to keep on writing limit until you actually take the limit if you don't well you're saying you've taken the limit and that's what it was so it's not a true statement so you have to write the limit as you're doing these problems now let's use those other rules one other rule said that anytime this is the cool one the one rule number property five says anytime you have a function to a power what I can actually do is take the limit of just that function and raise it to the the power later that's true you can do that means I can take the limit of x and then CU whatever that happens to be another thing said that I can separate two limits by multiplication so this would be the limit of two times the limit of x plus that's already a constant we'll deal with in just a how many people are okay with this so far do you see what we've done with these properties we actually broken up a pretty intense polom into limits of constants and limits of just X terms have you seen that what's interesting is I want you to think about this can you do this for any polinomial you can always separate by addition subtraction right you separate term by term then can you always take out exponents yes yes you can can you always separate multiplication absolutely so you could do this with any polinomial you follow me on that one well now check it out since we've broken up into such simple components you can now use those two B there's only two Basics use those two Basics to actually evaluate this limit can you tell me what's the limit of x as X approaches 2 it was one of those Basics that I gave you I drew the the pictures of them it said the limit of x as X approaches a was a it said the limit of C no matter what was C you with me on that so limit of a constant is the constant so limit of x is a whatever it's approaching so you all tell me now what's the limit of x as X approaches two it's just two yeah two and then I can Cube it minus oh how about this one what's the limit of two doesn't even matter what I'm approaching well what's the limit of two as I'm approaching two the limit of a constant is the constant so what's the limit of two two it's two it never changes two times uh how about this one what's the limit of x as X approaches two it is two plus what's the limit of seven no matter what you're approaching what's a limit of seven you with me on the seven it's a constant yeah so we had that those two Basics limit of a constant is simply the constant itself it's a horizontal line the limits always be the same it's just seven can you add that together how much is it 8 - 4 + 7 looks like 11 to me did you get 11 as well that means we've just calculated our very first limit without doing tables and without looking at graphs we're able to do this now can I can I ask you do one thing for me please just check this out can you go ahead and just in your head or off to the side take this number two plug it in there and tell me what you get can you do that for me what's F of two wait say that again 11 did y'all get 11 when you plugged in two wait that's weird is that a coincidence no no it's not a coincidence cuz here's what we can do oh not two sorry 11 it says well if you can separate a polom into its terms and then its individual components raised to powers and multiples like that essentially all you're doing is plugging in that number for those spots for your spots of X right for your variables of X basically you can do that here so here's what I'm going to say you already determined I already asked you this whether this would work for every polinomial you said that it would it or wouldn't it can you do this with every polinomial polom of things that looks like that can you do it for stuff like that absolutely you can always separate them take Powers outside break it up into a constant times a variable that means that to find the limit this an important thing to find the limit of any polom all you have to do is evaluate that function at the point a whatever that is this is going to work for every polom so this idea works for every polinomial is point a always given oh yeah yeah and so it's never it won't be it always be a given in the for initially yes this number is always given to you has to be given works for any polinomial in in plain uh well in mathematics I'll say it in plain English in just a bit here's basically basically what all this stuff says it says that the limit as X approaches a of some polom do you understand the notation the limit of a a polinomial that's a polinomial as X approaches some number is equal to P of a what's P of B say that's exactly right says evaluate the function at that point basically here's what it says in English to find the limit of a polom just plug in the number that's what it says can youall do that oh yeah that's great it says to evaluate the limit of a polinomial plug in the value to find the limit of polinomial just plug in the B which is a in our case you want to see a few more yeah hopefully you're not like nah done get all the hard stuff just leave like this you want the hard stuff don't you yes not really yes limit of x 5th - 3x + 4 all to the 3 power as X approaches 2 that's what we're asking here for now the question is could you could you if if they wanted you to could you do this whole process and do the same thing yeah yeah absolutely you can pull out that that three that power three you see it you can separate all the terms you can separate out that power five you separate the three and the X plug in those numbers in those two spots and it would be essentially just valuation of that so how can we figure out this limit just plug that number why don't you do that on your own plug that number in there substitute that in there because we know that the limit is going to equal whatever this function is with evalu at the point AAL 2 was it 30 to 30 power or something like that M 27 27,000 27,000 how many people got 27,000 20 is it 27,000 I hope so not everyone raise your hand are you guys okay on how we got those numbers I need to know if you're not then I can re explain it but not your head if you're okay on how we got those numbers the 27,000 yes so do you see that what we're what we're actually doing is saying okay I know this limit is the same thing as evaluation when I plug in the number two and then Cube it 32 three yeah I know I do many twos 32 - 6 like 26 + 4 that's 30 30 to the thir power and you get 27,000 you follow me on that one okay and that's exactly what that means hey you just evaluated your first limit don't you feel proud no oh well you're going to you're going to you get a plaque sure eat a bunch of candy you get lots of plaque get it get it plaque versus plaque oh it's so whatever I know but the way not all of our limits go to two I'm just using two so you know what about that now is that a polom it can the answer is no no that's a rational that's a rational function is it a polinomial but could you still do the same basic thing and answer is yeah you can because of I think it's rule number four or your property number four three or four one of those things which says that you can actually separate your division can't you provided that your denominator is not what will that make the denominator zero will this point make that zero then you're fine then you're fine you can do that so because we can do this whole step this is the limit as X approaches 2 of 4x^2 + 1 over limit as X approaches 2 of x - 3 well now look at it is that a polinomial yes is that a polinomial yeah they're both pols the that's polinomial and that's a polinomial so this says you can evaluate that by plugging in two and you can evaluate that by plugging in two the only thing you got to check for is that the denominator is not zero which we already know right it can't be zero on the denominator that would be a problem so do you need to show me this step no no just plug in the number if it works then you're okay if you have zero on the denominator then you're not okay okay do you get the idea though do you see that we can separate division provided that this number does not evaluate that polinomial make it zero then that's fine so we're going to separate that we don't have to actually show this part it's just I'm showing you once that it is true because now it makes it a polinomial it makes it a polinomial and we know from here hey you can evaluate a limit of a polinomial by just substituting in that number so therefore we can do it here uh have you substituted that in yet so it's going be 4 * 2^ 2 + 1 2 - 3 17 over7 notice how here I have to write the limit here I have to write the limit here I have to write the limit as soon as you evaluate you don't write the limit anymore do you guys see the difference there so yes you must write the limit until you actually evaluate it once you do that you're done no more limits you just have those numbers but you have to write it up until that point question um say that X was approaching three would you still be able to you would glad you ask that question can I answer that in like 30 seconds okay okay cool love those don't you love it like when you're thinking about something and you're going to make your next point because you're a teacher you know that's kind of cool you want to do then someone goes hey what up with this you're like a that's my next Point don't you love that it doesn't happen to you it happens to me all the time I love that uh actually it's going to be a minute and 45 seconds all right do you have the time on that sheet of paper [Laughter] maybe I'm not OCD how about that one is that a polinomial please shake your head no no pols look like this that's it that's pols no roots no denominators that's pooms so where this is definitely not a polinomial but I want you to see what you can do do you see that you could pull the cube root out of it once you did that you could separate by division like we did in this problem so essentially anything will work provided you plug the number in and you don't have any domain issues so basically if you plug this in it doesn't make that zero you're fine it doesn't make well actually that's a cube do even matter cube roots you can plug in any number that's fine so provided that doesn't that's not zero if you plug in one does this denominator go to zero no then you're fine why don't you go ahead and plug in one and see what we have notice I have my limit here we could do all this work right we could separate the cube root we could do that we could show that we could separate my limits by division and show that as well but you just need to know that we can plug in a number into a rational or any type of problem that we have provided that we don't have that denominator zero and don't run any into any domain issues so if we plug in that value of one we get the do we s the cube root yeah don't forget about the cube root how much does that give you well if you're going to say it say it how much it give you cube of six cube root of six cube of six pretty sure you were able to get the cube root of six okay I'm 10 12 seconds over now let me show you this problem firstly do you have any questions on the whole polinomial idea breaking that up any questions on what we're allowed to do over here we're allowed to uh evaluate limits by just substituting numbers provided we don't run into any problems problems would be zero on a denominator or things that don't validate our domain that would be a problem or sorry invalidate our that don't invalidate our I think this is now going to answer your question in every previous problem we were able to just substitute in that number into our limit because we knew we could break it up into uh forms of pols or or basically because they're pols Powers with individual X's multiplied by constants right and we could do those limits that's why we were able to do this stuff is because we could have shown all that breaking it up and just evaluated constant limits and limits that just had x's and then taken the powers later the the only difference with this one is if you try to do that if you separate this by division the numerators could work just fine because you're going to get how much on the numerator that's a polinomial right you get zero is it okay to have zero on a numerator sure yet on a numerator yes now what would happen though if you try to substitute in this two down here zero the limit of your denominator would be zero is that a good thing to have that's a problem we can't ever have that what do we do the top is difference of squares the top is a so wait a second though are you saying that if I do this I know you all know a difference of squares right what's it going to factor as are you saying that I should be able to simplify those out of this expression but wait a second wouldn't we be simplifying out a domain issue you're not actually say that again say it not going to actually ever get to the point two on the gra so are we simplifying out a domain issue not he's exactly right are we actually getting to the point two no so really this is kind of weird but with a limit we're technically not making anything any mistake here we're not actually getting to two we're actually getting that point so when we look at this we go oh okay we could just simplify that out we're not simplifying out a domain problem because none exists because we're not actually getting into two you just can't evaluate the limit by plugging it in because according to this function yes you will at that point that's the difference between pols that don't have issues and things like this that do that have domain problems if you're trying to find the limit of this sky as you're going two well there there's a problem with that there's a hole there right there there's do you recognize firstly that there is a hole and not an ASM toote here what was the difference between a hole and an ASM toote according to the algebra oh you better know you got to know that astes don't factor out say that louder ASM totes don't factor out you're right ASM tootes don't factor out holes do factor out do you remember that so if you can simplify it out that's a hole if you can't you have some sort of an ASM toote so this case yes we have a hole that means that if you have a hole in your graph can you actually find out where the function is at that point you can't even it doesn't even exist so we have to do limits to find that out but in order to to do that we do have to simplify this this function we can Factor we can simplify because we're actually not getting to the two this is okay it's okay because x x never equals two never gets there really close yes so what we can do now is say all right then this according to the limit is exactly the same thing as that is that now a polinomial sure can you plug in two how much you going to get four is four that's kind of neat right oh this should be amazing to you be like yeah we can simplify this stuff out because we're not actually getting there there therefore we change these weird looking uh holy functions not because they happen on Sundays but because you know we have and then we can just plug in the number because now it's a polinomial and we're good to go so if you can factor and simplify then you can find the limit does that make sense to you that's awesome few more okay we're going to make them a little bit more advanced a little bit more advanced Till by the end of the day we'll have some pretty unique things going on okay now before you get all crazy and start factoring everything that you see you might want to just check that point and see if it's even a problem all right because sometimes they might give you that stuff and there's no issue it'd be like this example this would have an issue if we were going to the limit of x equals or X is approaching three wouldn't that be a problem but we're not we're going to two so there was no problem here so at least check and make sure you actually have a problem before you start factoring things out make sense so try it do I have a problem if I try to evaluate at4 yes yeah I do I get Z over zero right that means you should be able to factor hey if you get 0 over Z I told you this was the property of mathematics if you get 0 over Z when plugg in the same number that means x minus that number is a root that means somewhere over here I can guarantee you're going to have an X+ 4 cuz x - -4 is x + 4 this will be x + 4 * something this will be x + 4 * something and then we should be able to simplify out that problem why don't you try that right now factor that I want you to simplify it and then see if you can evaluate the limit of what you get out of that should be your quoti I suppose did you factor was there an X plus 4 like I magically predicted I love when that happens too so if you were to factor this out by the way have you noticed that when you're factoring you still must have the limit notation you see that on the board you've got to have limit look at here's a limit here's a limit here's a limit when did I stop using limit when I finally actually was able to plug in the number do you see that you must have a limit I will Mark you points if you don't have those limits if you go I'm going to write this limit but not that one not that one I'm just going to my answer mm that's not how limits work if you say you don't have a limit here you start Crossing stuff out and you magically plug in you've made domain issue if you're with limits that's okay so you have to say I'm working with limits here until you get down to this point do you see the point all right so we still have a limit by the way that's going to be annoying I know because you're going to have lots of steps on some of these limits but you need to do it we're going to factor we're going to factor see anything that simplifies out of our problem now some of you might be asking well wait a second don't I still have a domain issue because if I plug in three I have a problem don't I still have a domain issue the answer is well yeah sure at three but are we trying to figure out what's happening around three I don't care about three what point am I trying to figure around yeah so I've gotten rid of the problem cuz as soon as I cross out this x + 4 now when I substitute in4 it's no longer an issue can you now evaluate at4 let's go ahead and do that notice how I've written limit limit factored limit still and now I can put well this is going to equal 2 -4 - 3 I've now evaluated my limit I don't write the limit notation any longer because I I don't have any more variables as soon as you substitute it for your variable that is your limit we get -27 as our how many people got 27 feel okay with this is this understandable you guys starting to get the the concept of working with this stuff it's kind of interesting isn't it what we can do I hope it's interesting to you oh how have it up there cool all right oh my gosh what are you going to do first do you think but before you factor don't get crazy on factoring what are you going to do check you're going to check it yeah check the five because if it works well there's no reason to factory that would just be a waste of time probably confuse yourself too like Wait nothing simplifies oh no now if you try the five here do you have a problem okay so if you do have a problem then what do you do now you factor so if you haven't factored already go ahead and Factor what's the top one factores plus 2 - 5 how about the denominator what do we got there ohus 5us 5 all right did you all Factor it correctly all right thank God good at least we factored it correctly do you see anything that simplifies wait not not both x 5 one so we go here and here yes and what we get out of this this is important example for you to see you get x + 2 x is still approaching 5 x - 5 try to plug in the five what are you going to get you going seven over zero is that still a problem oh man so wait a second what do you do if you still have a domain issue on this thing I've now given you two cases I've us in cases where the problem the domain issue is a hole do you see that it's a hole and you can get rid of a hole it's a removal discontinuity and you can find the limit of that it's very easy you factor it and then you evaluate now I've also given you another case where not only do we have a hole here we actually have what is that when you can't simplify out the domain issue that is a vertical ASM toote so now we have this issue what are we going to deal how are we going to do that well this is where you're going to use what's called a sign analysis test listen you you really do have to comprehend that if you can get a zero over zero like you did over here you're going to be able to at least Factor it and simplify something right sometimes as I've shown you it will get rid of the problem area and you can just substitute in a number and be just fine that happened here and that happened here now' your have be okay with that one now other times sure we got 0 over zero we factored it we got rid of a what looked like a problem area and it was that's like a hole however can you get rid of this x - 5 in any way whatsoever if you can't what was that called again it's ASM toote what you have to sign analysis test here's what you do with a sign analysis test you put the numbers that will make the numerator and the denominator equal to zero put that on a number line what numbers am I talking about here five definitely five because we want to find out what's happened at five and that was our problem area so five is going to have to go over here here somewhere so far so good now what else do we need now ne-2 is interesting we don't really need it cuz really we're looking at this area however we need to know what happens between this range you see what you're going to do is called a sign analysis test and that means you're going to find the sign in this interval and the sign in this interval the only reason why we need this number is to make sure that you pick something in this range because if you don't if you pick something in this range this is where the signs change from positive to negative does that make sense to you so you have to find something in this little range and this range over here it could be anything over here but in this range it's got to be between these two numbers that's why we put the -2 we're not taking a limit to2 we don't care really we don't care we want to find out what happens at the five is that clear for you are you talking about like the trick function sign no no this is easier okay there's no trick function here okay function I'm going okay see get there where's these Tri functions coming from I hate calculus no no trick functions this is basic basic okay this is just plugging in some numbers sign as in I am signing okay sign like like a sign like sign oh I get it sign like sin we're not sinning we're signing here we want the S let me WR that sign analysis analysis is another one of those things you can't really abbreviate that well anal got it the sign analysis that'll go viral on YouTube that' be awesome so again the reason why you have to have the negative -2 is because your sign will change in these two intervals and we don't care what happens here but we want to make sure we pick the correct number for this interval we don't want to be picking ne3 because it's going to give us the wrong interpretation of what happens around this now you have to know what happens around the five and you already said it once or twice before is this a whole or an ASM toote as it's an ASM toote because I can't get rid of it you follow so you know for a fact it looks like this you know for a fact that you you have an ASM toote right here right so you're going to be in one of four situations watch carefully you you are either going to be going like this true or like this or like this or like that it's one of those four situations and the sign analysis will tell you what it is here's how you do it I want you to take a number in this interval what's a good number in this interval pick six you can't pick five you well obviously you can't pick five pick six plug in six and tell me what you get plug it in not the original but no no you know what what you've done here is you just simplified out a whole it's going to give you the same exact answer so plug it in here what' you get you got eight CU you did eight wait what' you get oh right8 over one one so eight over one is positive 8 that's what I'm looking for I really don't care about the value I care about positive or negative what you get positive or negative make sure you know how to deal with your signs okay so you you got a positive you know what that means if you got a positive are you going to be going down to negative infinity or up to positive Infinity definitely positive Infinity because you're doing positives here you know it's an ASM toote already somehow you're going to be looking like that you okay with that so far okay now try another number in this interval again the reason why we have aa2 is to stop us from going too far so what's a number in here pick a better number than four pick zero zero is a great number interval so plug in zero what' you get 2 so is it positive or negative am I going to be going up to meet that other ASM toote at Infinity I'm going to be going I don't really care how the graph looks honestly I don't I just really care what the ASM tootes are what what the function is doing around the ASM toote because that's the limit is what's it doing around the number do I need to plug in a number over here pass -2 no this is just to stop me so so you got to tell me does the limit exist cuz we're talking about five does the limit exist at five or not no if it did they'd both be going up or they both be going down okay if they're like this then it doesn't exist but this is how you show that it doesn't exist you don't just automatically go I can't do it does not exist okay because you could be wrong all right it happened before it does not exist because you showed it with your sign analysis test so on your test when I give you a problem very much like this which I will do and I ask you to show your work or I might even say show a sign analysis that's what I'm talking about I need you to prove to me prove to me that that limit does not exist so if they say show the limit doesn't exist that's it okay if the limit does exist you'll be able to simplify out the holes if it if it doesn't exist well then you have to show a sign analysis test show that you have an ASM toote and it's going like that or some other way that you you cannot make those things go together how many people understood that what we just talking about good all right couple notes for you so I'll write this out so you can remember later first one if you get 0 over Z what that means is you have a common factor at that point X Plus x minus that point so if you get 0 over 0 what you're going to try to do is factor and simplify factor and simplify 90% of the time that's going to work just fine that's these examples over here all right the other percent of the time let's say you factored you simplified you still have an issue so that's number two if you cannot simplify the problem okay if you can't get rid of the problem if you can't we'll say it this way if you can't cancel the problem because youall love the word cancel right if you can't cancel the problem that means it's not a hole if you can cancel the problem it's a hole if you can't cancel a problem that means you have an ASM toote at that point what you're going to need to do is evaluate with a sign analysis so two two situations holes cancel them great done not holes those are ASM tootes sign analysis will show you what that does around the ASM toote if they're go into the same thing it exists positive netive Infinity if it's not then it doesn't exist and that's the only way you can show that for us so if you cannot cancel the problem on the denominator check with sign analysis because the limit might not exist because a limit might not exist how many people feel okay with what we talked about so far okay I'm going to show you a couple more very unique examples we'll talk about those um things you you really have to know exactly what to do uh when you see them so I to make sure you see them I've started writing in all caps thanks to you you're welcome my handwriting is so atrocious that means bad so condescending when I just did you that's horrible um sorry um it was really bad until I started writing all all caps and now I have trouble even writing limit like like that also my dad was a carpenter and a a draftsman and so they used he used all caps all the time so I want to be like him so I started doing that too he's much better at it all right now we got this this situation here limit x -1 over square root of x oh my gosh well the first thing you try to do is what try to plug it in do you have an issue now you have Z over zero true unfortunately for us these aren't easy to factor right you do you probably do have some sort of factor out of that but it's not easy to do polom are easy to factor that's fine but with this that that theorem really doesn't hold that much water because it's not easy to factor that so okay what are we going to do any ideas conjugate have you ever heard of the conjugate the conjugate is those two terms with a different sign in the middle if we do that that's one way you learn in your intermediate re course on how to rationalize a denominator or rationalize a numerator or basically just rationalize out a square root so if we do that that might help us so don't forget the algebra that you know sometimes we can rationalize if we do we'll rationalize < TK X - 1 oops sorry plus one over > x + 1 you have to use the conjugate though other if if you don't well then you're going to just make your problem worse because you're not going to get rid of a square root it's going to be within a middle term of your problem so you have to alternate those signs you guys okay with that you sure so use that conjugate now let's see of course we have parenthesis here now I'm going to give you little piece of advice generally generally you don't want to distribute in this case the numerator if you're a rationalizer the numerator you wouldn't want to distribute the denominator because ultimately you're trying to simplify out something are you with me on that you're trying to simplify that out so I'm not going to I'm purposely not going to distribute the numerator unless I absolutely have to if I run into an issue so right now I'm going to leave this as x -1 and theun of x + 1 why because I'm trying to simplify stuff that's why now on the denominator you tell me uh when I what do I have to do with this I do have to foil or or distribute so that means every ter times every term U tell me what's otk of x * X uhuh now do you see what happens and why we use the conjugate if you distribute this we get X we get plus < tkx we get minus rootx what's going to happen with this that that's why we use the conjugate and then last you're going to get what you get xus one do you see why we don't distribute the numerator if you distribute the numerator you got to you got to mess of crap up there right you're going have to refactor it's not going to be easy if you don't distribute it the factoring is obvious the simplification is obvious what are you going to simplify well at least I hope it's obvious is it obvious to you what you're going to cross out all right good wo yeah kind of obvious all right well our limit as X approaches one notice I'm still writing limit is the what what what do we have left are you going to have an issue oops that doesn't look like an X are you going to have an issue if you plug in one it's not negative it's positive one so we're okay we have no denominator anymore because we rationalized it it went away because we were able to simplify it if we plug in one what are you going to get that's your limit how many people feel okay with this so far would you like to try one on your own let's do that I'm going to give you a little bit more complicated of one not too bad and if you get stuck on it no big deal that's fine but I want you to at least think about it while you're here this will be where we end today so limit as X approaches Z of < TK 1 + x - 1/ X are you going to have an issue here yeah I mean straight up we're going to zero and that's over zero that's a problem so what could you possibly do run away yeah done no we're not going to just leave the problem we can't plug in zero the only thing you can do do here is what do you think can we use that same idea but only in reverse let's try that go ahead and do that multiply by the conjugate conjugates have to have different signs they have to that's got to be the same thing on the numerator denominator it has to otherwise you're not multiplying by one and if you're not multiplying by one you're changing the problem you can't change the problem also one more thing I need you to look up here at the board when you do this that sign doesn't change it's only the thing after the square root so this stays the same did you all multiply by exactly that do you see how that is the conjugate we have the square root whatever that sign is and that whatever that constant is that's what we have here the square root the different sign same constant same exact thing why you why you need the same exact thing in case you're wondering well Mr Leonard why don't you change that sign as well what you're trying to do is multiply this in such a way that you actually eliminate the root so when you multiply this one times this one the whole entire root goes away right the only time you can do that is if the roots are identical so you can't have different signs otherwise they're not identical hey which one aren't we going to distribute here the numerator or the denominator denominator don't distribute the denominator by the way I'm saving your lives here if you distribute the denominator you have to factor it again that waste time so literally I'm saving your time there go your life nice right I know I'm such a nice guy today so on the denominator I know I'm going to have X and then the < TK of 1 + x + 1 I'm not going to distribute that the numerator yes you're going to distribute the thing you're trying to rationalize so if you were to distribute this once youall help me along here when I distribute this what's the first expression I'm going to get 1 + x very good okay and then what so I'm going to getun x 1 + x positive < TK 1 + x negative that's going to be gone that's what the conjugate does for you and lastly I'm going to get so this is 1 + x - 1 anything else we can do with that like term anything else yeah combine like terms what do you get if you combine like terms on the numerator that's kind of nice cuz one and negative one and this is why we didn't distribute the denominator because if you look at that that's what we're trying to simplify out right trying to get rid of that 99% of the time this works out for you I wrote it back it doesn't matter now that you see the X and X as a factor on the denominator those things are gone what's on your numerator please oh zero is not on your numerator what's on your numerator come on now people one one yeah when you cross something out you don't get a zero you're actually factoring that out saying X overx is one so you have a one up there uh by the way please don't make the the intermediate algebra mistake of doing this a lot of people do this when they're just beginning they go oh yeah I cross everything out therefore I have that is that true no no you don't have that you actually have this if you forget that what you're going to end up is end up with is the reciprocal of the answer that you actually want that's not good hey now can you plug in zero and be okay yeah even though you still have X on the denominator look what happens what's 1+ 0 one sare root of one plus two said two I was one step ahead of myself I'll just write on the board there you go one2 would your ra have feel okay with our our limits good deal now you know we went a long way today we now know how to evaluate and compute these limits uh next time I'll show you how to do some peace wise limits I'll show you some trigonometric limits and then we're off to a fun start did you have fun today you have fun today all right so welcome back we're talking about limits uh we're going to start talking about peace wise limits now now for us we found out that when we're taking a limit usually we can cancel out a problem or if we can't we'll use a sign analysis test because we have an ASM toote hopefully you practice that in your homework were you okay with that idea so generally what we're trying to do is plug in the number plug in the where X is approaching if it works great that's your limit if it doesn't work well then you have to factor do something to find that limit typically factoring we'll be able to simplify that a little bit or we found out we can rationalize denominators and numerators if we have square roots we do things like that to work around that limit now what we're going to talk about today is some some different aspects to that we're going to talk about peie wise limits I'll show you what you can do with those things it's going to be kind of nice just go follow me on this then we'll talk about trigonometric limits and that'll that'll end our day we have a lot to talk about on trigonometric limits so piecewise limits here's basically the idea when you're talking about pie wise limits and peie wise of course means different functions all matched together that have different directions for each part of it you have seen PE wise functions before PE wise limit says what's the limit as we're approaching that interchange basically does it exist does it not exist what what what does it happen to be so our idea is we're going to have to take some one-sided limits because each piece is different right we're going to take one-sided limits and see if they match up if they match up great limit exists if they don't match up then no the limit doesn't exist are you with me on this I'll give you a real nice way to do this a graphic organizer hopefully this will help you out and then of course if there's questions man ask so let's let's talk about this our idea is we're going to find some one-sided limits and we're going to see if they are equal let's start off with an example let's say that I give you this I say that your function is actually made up of three parts the first part says you're going to do 1/ x + 2 if x is less than2 I say you have a different range you have x^2 - 5 if we're between -2 and pos3 and lastly our last little step we're going to be the < TK of x + 13 if x is greater than 3 now because we have a peie wise limit we basically have in this case three different functions that means we can't just look at this thing Hammer at it one function and find out what is the limit uh of of any particular place what I'm going to ask you for is can we find the limit at two and three as X approaches two and three why two and three well if you look up here that's the only place that could po possibly have an issue right is -2 that would have an issue whether everywhere else it's continuous the limit's going to exist no problem same thing here that's continuous everywhere only problem would be maybe at the end points of two and three here the only problem could be at three with that function so we're going to talk about the limits as X approaches -2 and X approaches pos3 are you with me on that so that that's our idea here what we're going to have to do is find our left side limit for each function and a right side limit and see if they meet up somewhere if they meet up at those points now here's the way that I like to do this first thing I like to do is draw a representation of your of your graph of your number line basically just like that break it up into the places where your pie wise functions broken up what are those key points what numbers delineates our function from the next piece of the function where does one function start and one function stop basically two that's a key point right so we're going to have to have -2 on here somewhere what's another key point for us let's call this one function one and function two and function three can you tell me what function is in this range over here what what function takes over for this interval function three because it says for any X is bigger than three I'm Now function three does that make sense to you so I know that I'm looking at function three here what interval or sorry which function takes over in this interval function two for sure and that leaves this one with F1 let's make sure X is less than -2 function one takes over do you understand that this is how actually our graph should look should be function one then function two then function three and I'll draw this graph for you at the end uh just so you see what this really does look like you with me still so far though so here's the idea if we want to find the limit as X approaches -2 and the limit as X approaches -3 we don't have to find one side limits for all three functions just the two functions that are approaching that number number so for instance if I want to find the limit as X approaches -2 if I'm going from the left if I'm going from the left which function am I going to use function what from the left I'd be using function one does that make sense to you now from the right as we're approaching -2 which function am I using from the right function two yeah that's right so so around this function I'm going to have a one side limit from the left using F of one uh sorry the first function then I'm GNA have a one side limit from the right using the second function does that make sense to you it's a way to picture this how about around three we want X to approach three how about you guys over here what function are we going to use as we approach three from the left function function two that's right that's in the interval how about from the right function function three we're not using function one over here are we we're not using function three over here we're just looking around that that number what functions we have so now because we have this gives you a pretty good idea of what your graph looks like right this is how you make up your one-sided limits now okay so I'm going to take a limit as X approaches -2 from the left a limit as X approaches -2 from the right and I'm going to see if those two things are equal if those are equal then we'll have a limit as X approaches -2 in if not well then we won't do you all understand the idea so far are there any questions so far on the idea okay so let's go ahead let's try this um what's the specific function I'm going to use for this one this is -2 from the left hand side you all said that was function which one function what's function one one now write that this one by the way is going to be the hardest rest a reason how about going from -2 from the right hand side what function would we be using isn't this kind of nice you just look at that can't you kind of cool look at that one uh Now function two what's the actual function two so write that so we said for this range from the left Function One this range from the right function two we're going to see what these are if they're the same thing then our limit will exist if they're not the same thing will our limit exist okay so we have that idea down now how about we set the other ones as well let's start talking about the as we approach three so we're going to need again a limit as X approaches three from the left three from the right if they are the same we'll have a limit at three let's fill out the functions though let's fill up the functions as we approach everybody three from the left hand side which function are we using and function two again you said that was x^2 - 5 so we'll write that how about from the right hand side what function are we using function three what's function three I'm assuming your mumbling was sare otk of x + 13 was that what you were mumbling I 13 okay now here's the deal I'm going to work this side this these ones first then this one cuz that one's a little bit more difficult let me pait something to you what I'm going to say is that if a limit exists a one-sided limit definitely exists would you agree to that if a limit overall exists then a one-sided limit will certainly exist agreed so a limit existing is stronger than a one-sided limit existing does that make sense to you well here's the cool part about that then and this a lot of you were asking how do I find one side limits check it out if you know for sure that a limit exists then the one side limit will exist plugin three ignore the from the left plug in three what do you get you get four guess what that's your limit why because does the limit of three sorry does the limit as X approaches 3 exist for that function absolutely without equivocation because that right there's a polinomial right and you know with polinomial is you can just plug in a number unless you have a problem well if the limit at three exists the limit from the left certainly has to it must that's a weaker statement plug in three you're going to get four does that make sense to you let's try it next again if a limit exists a one side limit will also exist at the same number so ignore the the Plus for a second can you plug in three without a problem there what are you going to get you're going to get four saying the limit exists therefore the limit from the right well it has to exist if the limit exists the right and left side limit for sure exists they have to go to that same number that's going to be four now you're able to answer your wasn't that nice and easy just plug them in that's it just plug them in if you can just plug them in nice and easy does this limit exist why yeah I don't care that they're not the same function they go to the same value limit is four ra you have you're okay with that one so far kind of nice right one side limits aren't so bad P wise functions they can get kind of messy we find that over here but not too too bad do you have any questions on this because I'm going to erase it because I need the room any questions on that okay so again if a limit exists a one- side limit will exist find out your one- side limits if they're the same then your limit at that point for sure you got it now let's start over here can I plug this into that function yeah absolutely that's a polinomial so ignore the the right plug in -2 how much are you going to get one absolutely negative one there's the issue okay here's the issue uh ignore from the left can I plug in -2 aha so what you're saying is that the limit at -2 you don't know whether that exists or not right you don't know what's that mean can you can can you cross out any part of this can you factor and cross it out okay so think back what do you use if you can't cross out a problem what do you use the thing you couldn't abbrev that's right the sign analysis thing you have to use that something you can abbreviate it it's just going to look funny in your paper but you have to use a sign analysis here so if you have a sign analysis at -2 what we care about what's Happening Here what is happening at -2 do you have a hole do you have an ASM toote which one folks you all should be a telling that you all should know that at this point if cannot cross out your problem what is it it's an ASM toote so what do you have as you approach -2 it is certainly an ASM toote yes it's we just want to know is it going upwards or is it going downwards what could you do to find that out any value any value to the left over here so plug in -3 if you plug in3 to this function are you getting a positive or A negative negative definitely negative so am I going upwards or downwards like that right so here's what you're just finding out what does this limit I don't care from the right look why don't I care about this why don't I care is this the same function on this side of that -2 is that the same function over there no no that's we've already taken care of that one I don't care about that I just care about this so what is this limit equal can you tell me yeah as we go towards -2 from the left hand side it is going like that that's going to towards where so let me recap just a little little bit what you're doing you're breaking up your interval you have three different functions in this case you set up your limits around those breakoff for your your intervals you use left side limits you use right side limits and you see if they're the same some of them are going to be easy like what I showed you over here others of them you might have to do a little bit of work these ones you can just plug in that one you can just plug in this one if you can't cross anything out and eliminate the problem you've got to use a sign analysis test don't get stuck on that okay you're going to have something like this on your test don't get stuck on what do I do oh no I can't plug in -2 what now sign analysis test if you don't know what to do you don't got to throw things jeez my goodness you're in luck it surved you just got that yeah now you just got that with some nice marks on it congratulations don't just get a new motorcycle okay anyway uh so this one yes you plug this in this one well you can't cross anything out you have to do a S analysis test do what you know don't get stuck on it if you can't cross anything out sign analysis that's that's the only two things you got okay so we have this we were able to plug in number for the left of our interval that's the side we were wanting went to negative Infinity do does the limit exist for this this is1 that's netive Infinity last time I checked those things aren't exactly the same so this does not exist but that folks is how you check you don't check by plugging in numbers okay randomly you check by showing your work like this this is showing your work does that make sense to you I don't want little tables or anything like that see look the numbers are not the same I don't care I want you to show me what this is now the way this graph looks if you want to see why this doesn't exist uh what this thing is is a parabola part of Parabola that's symmetrical around the y- axis and intersects it's going from -2 non- inclusively to three inclusively so if you plug in -2 what we get 1 looks like that and three if we plug in three uh we get out of that four that's not really accurate that part can't cross three and end at three but whatever then from there on out we have the square root of X+ 13 which starts at four and takes off something like that and then we have this one which at this point I'm sorry this one this one over x + 2 if you graph that that's some sort of descending function that goes like that at that point does the limit exists as we approach -2 no this is a rough sketch by the way does the limit exist two absolutely because that was that was closed off by the way it's a function because that's not equal to and that is that's okay we don't fail that part uh this part would have had the open c circle around it but it's filled in by that point so we have this Parabola limit exists there absolutely limit exists here no netive infinity and a value Rich have you're able to follow that feel okay with it good deal are you ready for some trigonometry no I know it's supposed to be trigonometry Tuesday but we're we're day early so it's all good was that your drinking party idea drinking party IDE I don't have drinking parties koola limits of tree functions okay there's a couple things you have to buy in on for me to do this properly and the first thing you got to buy in on is that s and cosine are continuous everywhere continuous means you can draw it without lifting your pencil off the paper can you draw s and cosine such that they are continuous do you ever lift your pencil off the paper no so they are continuous so first thing this is going to come up later in our class but I want to say it now s and cosine are continuous everywhere tra tra so because we can do that because there are no problems we can use something that we use for pols you see pols were continuous everywhere if you think about any polinomial I'm not talking about a rational function okay I'm not talking about denominators I'm not talking about roots that we have over here this is a rational function clearly it's not continuous everywhere -2 fails this is not not a continuous ever because it doesn't even exist for part of it okay so we're not talking about that what we're talking about is continuous functions like this one that's continuous everywhere you're not going to have a problem no holes no ASM tootes agreed s and cosine we just said are the same thing therefore if we have S and cosine are continuous everywhere we can apply the same logic and say then the limit of s of X as X approaches a is what do you think it's not a it's not a you wouldn't say this you wouldn't say the limit as X approaches 5 of x^2 - 5 is 5 that's not true what would you do to find it plug in you would plug it in so to find the limit of this what what we do we plugged in right it wasn't -2 it's what we got after we plugged it in so it's not a what is it a s of a absolutely likewise because cosine is also continuous everywhere we can do the same thing oops yeah that's true it says that you don't nothing bad happens basically that would be something bad happening there we go that looks a little bit better what about tangent tangent so my question is is tangent continuous everywhere draw tangent with your hands how's it go look like you're dancing yeah you doing I should have used that I went out dancing the other night I should have used my my SC curves it would have been the hit of the party probably not maybe probably not okay so we got to do a little bit more work since it's not continuous everywhere we're going to have to break this down a little bit so the limit of tan X as X approaches he let's figure this out tell me what is tangent use an identity what's tangent sure so we know for a fact that the limit of tangent is the same thing as the limit of s over cosine true very true very true now there was one property of limits that said you can separate limits by division remember that property kind of cool let's do it okay okay so limit of s limit of cosine do we now know what the ignore the bottom do we know what the limit of s x is as X approaches a sin a sure so this says okay I've got sin a what's the limit of cosine as X approaches a what's s over cosine Aha and you go yay what's the one thing I've screwed up on be Z say say that again can't be zero why can't cosine be zero that was the one thing that one little condition about that property if you remember it said you can do that provided that your denominator when you split that up doesn't ever equal zero and so we'd say sure the limit the limit of tan X as X approaches a is T A except at certain points at certain points and that's where cosine would equal zero uh that's specifically is the reason why you get all those Asm tootes on your tangent line is because tangent is s over cosine so naturally the sign over cosine and cos equals z you have an ASM toote remember the ASM toote idea if you can't cross it out you get an ASM toote right that works all time so that's why we get those ASM tootes going on and those ASM tootes occur at X cannot equal or we will have a a discontinuity uh because right here oh let me draw some purple so you see it from the different cosine X cannot equal zero it does you have a problem where that happens is uh every plus and minus < / 2 so piun / 2 3K 2 things like that X or a or either one cosine X can't equal zero at those points you could say x can't equal these things so or cosine cosine a really doesn't matter say cos a a little more sense cosine a can't equal zero does you get a problem so tangent would even be continuous at at these points um plus orus pi/ 2 because when you put those into cosine you get zero plus or minus 3 Pi 2 and so on and you can really you can see this in the domain of tangent if you look at the domain of tangent that's again that's why you get those ASM toes every pi/ 2 remember tangent power two astop 3 power two asmt and so on and so on and so on and negatively as well you guys all right with this so far this is our Basics you guys okay with our Basics start ramping it up a little bit you're like no no this is fine let's just stick with this good we need to practice this a lot too bad said disappoint a lot in this car there you go that looks messy enough didn't it how about that yes sweet do this okay uh what in the world let's just give up call it a day you ready out screw this stuff math just watch football can't do math and football they're oxymorons mathematical football oons brain injuries and football that goes together not math work okay what can you do with this well I'll tell you something uh you can this is interesting but if a function is continuous you can treat it like a composition is co sign continuous everywhere so what you can do with this is kind of cool what you can do is say all right s cosine continuous everywhere you can do a composition cosine is continuous so by composition actually reverse composition look what you can do you can say instead of taking a limit of cosine of something you can actually do this it's very much like removing an exponent from your limit you can say I don't want to deal with that I want to deal with cosine of my limit that's legal why would you rather deal with that have you seen things like this before yeah actually I think I've given you that exact same example so far in this class you've seen things like that can you do this limit so as long as you can do this limit and don't forget about your cosine you'll be fine it's interesting to think that the angle now is a limit that's weird right so cosine of what are you going to do with that limit what are you going to do first you're going to try to before you factor you're going to try to try to plug it in I mean don't may as well just try that if you plug in one though you're going to get 0 over 0 what does 0 over 0 tell you is factoring going to work or not yes 0 over Z tells you that so you're going to factor it probably going to work now we've seen one case where it doesn't where it was a double root okay that that happens but factoring is something you should try first so we'll have the limit X goes to one of well I know youall can Factor we got x + 1 we got x - one what can you do now sure what was that discontinuity that we just talked about was that a hole or an ASM toote in this particular case hole ohle sure because you can cross it out and there's no more problem left that was a hole now um other question let's see oh I had one more was on my mind ah forgot it cross it out do you have any problems left notice how we have to keep writing limit until we actually evaluate the limit that's important part of it what can you do can you plug in the number and be okay so then what we have right here is cosine of I know I can just plug in the one 1 + 1 what's cosine of 1 + 1 cosine of two done cosine of two we can do one plus one I like one plus one how do you feel okay with this one so we can treat that like a composition no we just insert the one with the initial problem why do we have to pull the cosine out can you just let keep writing it the same way and come to the exact same answer yeah would that be still an acceptable way of writing it I don't know okay just showing you you can do it cuz a lot of people go what do I do with that you go well can you still Factor it can you still cross stuff out and the answer is well technically no because it's inside of cosine but as soon as I move the cosine outside see what we're dealing with now is a limit and now it's not a domain problem because you're not actually approaching the one so yeah then you can does that make sense okay so moving the cosine out is just a matter of semantics basically yes yes but important semantics nonetheless so can you do it yes you can do it does that answer your question all right would you like to travel more answer is yes most of the time yeah unless I'm really tired never came down one could always wish I don't even drink coffee oh man if I drink coffee you guys would be in trouble if I drink coffee that day it's like crazy yeah so basically do you actually have to pull out the cosine yeah you can you can that's the reason why this is allowed to do it do you have to show me that I don't really care um it what it basically says is if you can plug in the number you can do it that's that's what cosine being continuous everywhere says to do also says that you can still cross stuff out as you're going through your problem because it's a composition it's continuous everywhere you can pull that out does that make sense to you so can we try to plug in a number here is that okay sure as long as we don't run into an issue IE you you plug in something that's not even in the domain like a negative root or you have a denominator that's zero that would be the only issues you have do you have an issue if you plug in pi over2 here no actually if you look at this that's a polinomial right plus a function that's continuous everywhere that means you could split that up by addition we knew limit rules for that you could do this one by itself just plug in Pi / 2 you can plug in pi2 to cosine because it's continuous everywhere not a problem so that says that just like other limits that we're dealing with try plug it in the problem first if you can no problem so that would be 3 Pi / 2^ 2 plus cosine pi/ 2 uh what's all this going to give you not as a decimal oh come on what's pi over 2^ 2 you can say pi^ squ it's okay Pi s over 4 very good so this is going to give you 3 pi^ 2 over four are you following me on that okay what's that going to give you don't say that loud I want youall to think about it you need to know that I said don't say loud and hold it in zero notice how at this point I don't have to write limit anymore I actually inserted the pi/ two you guys see that that's your answer so once you once you're no longer dealing with variables you don't have to keep writing limits as soon as you evaluate your limit at at that point no more limits but what if you keep doing step after step you know because like I I write it out I do this part of the math and this part of the math and I keep continuing on but once I put in once there's no longer variables then once you evaluate the limit normal once you are able to plug in that number no more limits you've done the limit right yeah over and over and over again well you should you need to write it I had to write it here I had to write it here here but not here because I was able to plug in one now what if we say we write it too much are we on it there's no more limit here so if we wrote limit in there the whole thing is you got to know what a limit actually is right you got to know that a limit is what does the function do as you're get into that number you got to know that as you're getting to that number it's PO number consider everywhere you can actually plug it in and that is your limit okay you say this is still a limit of something no it's not that is the answer to your limit question but it's that was a good question though I'm glad you brought that up because maybe other people were confused about that that's a good question remember for something a little bit more interesting you know what interesting means m mathematics right harder harder scarier scarier yeah it's a little bit scary I'm going to show you something it's kind of cool it is not my Darth Vader mask was pretty cool no I'm lying my parents once told me that I had a stormtrooper mask but I've never been able to find it so I know they're lying they like oh yeah we bought that for you it's it's like when you're like growing up and you ask your parents have I ever been to Disneyland like yeah but really it was just a park down the street with some guy named Greg same thing that's Mickey Mouse no that's Uncle Greg okay okay let's try that let's try that oh okay let's go through the process of finding limit right right the first thing you try to do is what yeah you try to plug it in so you plug it in what's s of Zero no sign of Z is not one sign Z is zero over how much can you factor sign you ever been able to factor sign in your life no no no so can you factor out anything and cross anything out can I just cross out the x and x and get sin yay it doesn't work okay sign has to have something next to so if you do that you have sin in mathematics that's not acceptable you can't do that so we're basically stuck there's no way to do this Pro unless you want to just plug in endless numbers there's no really way to do this but we're going to find a way to do it you ready to find a way to do it some trigonometry here's our idea I'll see if I remember how to do this in a while first thing we're going to do oh yeah we're going to bound this we're going to make up a triangle so let's here what I'm going to do is take part of my kind of a unit circle not really make it better that's better I'm going to take my unit circle what I'm going to do is take an arbitrary angle I can't be specific because of course you want this to work all the time so I'm going to draw that now what I'm going to do from this I'm going to make up two triangles I'm going to drop a perpendicular right from here I'm also going to drop a perpendicular it goes like that okay so let me let me Define a couple things firstly we're going to call X our angle second thing what do I need I need this I need that now what I'm going to tell you is if we if we need to solve for that let's see this is going to be our t x how far is this distance right here from here here to here why so would you agree that stick with me here folks are you okay that X is our angle forly I'm I'm calling this length y Okie doy and and this this is one from from here to here that's one give me the relation sh of tan X then s over cosine yes in the specific instance with a large triangle tangent is opposite over adjacent true what's the opposite y over one one because that is the unit circle well interesting then y = Tan x so this equals Tan x oh let's see one more thing we also need this distance I we need that distance right there so let's say what do we want to do this coordinate is what's the coordinate on a unit circle well that would be for specific angle what's the what is is it cosine or cosine jeez I'm asking you come on you got to know this agree okay yes sinx is typically y for inside Triangle what that what that means is I I'll try not to screw this up too much for for that means that our our X for this inside Triangle is cosine X do you agree that means that our our Y is actually sinx right now also what we're going to be doing is looking at this this not this well this one gives our height but also this one that triangle right there what we're going to be doing is comparing the areas of these triangles so let let me recap just in in 30 30 seconds what we've done we've gone ahead we made up two actually three triangles this one just gave us the height that gave us the height this would be cosine but more importantly this one this height is sinx do you all agree with that one furthermore if I call this y y is equal to tan X because of the relationship of X and one you guys okay with that one okay now we're ready to compare the triangles so we got we've actually have three things going on I need you see all three things first we have a big triangle you see the big triangle yes we have a smaller triangle that's this one so we have big triangle we have small triangle and then we have sector do you agree with that so what we want to do is consider the areas we have big triangle we have sector and we have small triangle can you tell me how you find the area of a triangle it's area of a triangle or base times height over two yes one half Bas let's look at the big triangle what's the uh what's the base this is one times what's the height instead of Y let's say Tan x and to find the triangle I divide by two I need to show a hand see if you're okay with the area of the large triangle base time height over two we have basee 1 height is y yes but y = Tan x I'm going to use Tan x cuz I want everything in the same variable all in x's and then divide by two uh let's do this small triangle then we'll talk about the sector small triangle that's this one right here not this too small one but this one right there are you with me on that one it's that one and that's the big one okay and then we'll talk about the sector in a moment uh what's the base of my smaller triangle what's the height the height of my smaller triangle sin x not cosine X right cosine X would be the sin x would be the height of the smaller triangle because that is actually a point on the unit circle do you believe me so that would be sin x and then well oh shoot sorry I'm off point 1 * sin x over two are you okay with big triangle and small triangle you all right with that one do you know how to find the area of the sector what are we talking which which one of these we talking this is the sector High the are the sector minus the small triangle sure how do you find the area of sector use a big triangle M there's actually a formula for it it's this it is your radius times your angle radius angle two you ready for the math magic ready you have to buy into one thing you have to agree that the area of the sector is in between the areas of the big triangle and the small triangle would you agree with that it goes big triangle then sector than small triangle true so what we're saying here is that the area of the small triangle is less than the air dector Which is less than the area of the big triangle agreed or not what can I do to the twos If I multiply all those inequalities by two which is legal what happens to the twos twos are gone TW are gone so what I'm going to do is change this into s x is less than x is less than Tan x some basic algebra basic algebra you okay with that so far now here's the cool part what I'm going to do I'm going to divide each of these three things by sinx where sin x is positive it's in the positive quadrant that's okay we're talking about a positive angle right here what that means is that we're not going to change around these inequalities so then this does that you still okay with that so far we divide everything by sin x how much is Tan x over sin x say it again 1/ cosine 1/ cosine because Tan x is s over cosine yes divided by sign that means you flip multiply you're going to be getting rid of those signs so you're going to get one over cosine we're almost done here's do I'm going to reciprocate each of those fractions I'm going to reciprocate the run the run the one the X over sin x and the one over cosine X what that's going to do is also flip around my inequalities if you reciprocate that it's going to flip your inequalities does that make sense to you that's a mathematical truth so I'm going to have one still because the reciprocal of one is one is greater than sin XX which is greater than cosine X over one do you see this thing anywhere you see it right in the middle do you see how it's squeezed between two functions it's squeezed between one and cosine X does that make sense now here's the theorem it's called The Squeeze theorem The Squeeze theorem says if the limit of this goes to something and the limit of this goes to something then the thing in the middle has to go to that same limit if these are equal does that make sense to you says I'm trying to take the limit as we we go to zero agreed so then the limit of one what's the limit of the number one as X approaches zero can you tell me that what's the limit of one doesn't matter what we're going to right the limits one tell me what's the limit cosine X as X approaches Z Now what do you get of cosine of0 what's cosine of 0 cosine Z is it's not zero one it is one here's what that says check it out this is by The Squeeze theorem it says that right now if I take the limit sin XX as X approaches zero it was squeezed between two functions whose limit was one as we went to zero says the limit of one is one says the limit of cosine as we approach zero is also one what does this limit absolutely have to be if it's between those two functions the limit has to be between those two functions only they're going to the same number what's that limit has to be one it's squeezed it's saying the right bound is one the left bound is one can it be anything different than one no no it has to be one Tech technically I'm supposed to have these throughout the whole thing and that's the big punch line for this part right now we're not done with no so again what we just did we learned we learned one thing about this we learned last time that the limit as X approaches zero of sin x overx was equal to what was it equal to do you remember okay and again for the for the last time we did not prove the squeeze theorem we used the squeeze theorem to prove this thing we bound it between two functions whose limit was one therefore this was in the middle of it that limit had to be one as we approach zero so this equal one that's number one thing you got to remember you got to remember that one that's going to be in your head all right so memorize that thing when X approaches zero of this function you get one if x approaches anything else besides zero well it doesn't matter you can just plug that number in okay that's fine now there's a couple of them that that we might also want to know is there a relationship for cosine firstly and is there a relationship for tangent we're going to look at those today then I'll show you how to put everything together and do any limit well that's reasonable of some trigonometric functions you ready for it yes it's no Monday excuses this time it's not Monday it's Monday Monday no no it's Tuesday I got you Tuesday and Wednesday Friday it's Friday okay I can understand but no no no it's Tuesday today we're rolling so number one thing another number one thing can we find the limit as X approaches zero of this 1 - cosine X over X well let me ask you the question can you just plug in the zero if you do plug in the zero what do you get you get z z what's cosine of Z folks you didn't know that cosine of 0 is one so on the numerator you get 1 - one that would be zero right and of course if you plug in zero X would become zero you get 0 over zero that's a problem can you factor one minus cosine X and cross out the X on the bottom nothing we can do with that we're GNA have to find some way around it just like we did with this one are you ready for it yes it's not going to be nearly as time consuming or mentally consuming as this one was okay this one's actually quite basic here's what I'm going to do what I'm going to do is find some way to to see some sort of an identity in here so so what we're going to try to do is work around this 1 - cosine X and one thing I can do perhaps multiplying by the conjugate would would help us remember what the conjugate is just changes what about that yeah that's it so in our case the conjugate would be one + cosine X over 1 + cosine X okay well let's keep this going then I've got a limit as X approaches zero the denominator is now x * 1 + cosine X you guys okay on the denominator I haven't distributed anything I'm just putting those together for right now now could you tell me on the numerator on the numerator let's do a little work here what am I going to get If I multiply 1 - cosin x * 1 + cosin x what would you what would you get out of that okay try it on your own if you if you can't do it in your head try it on your own distribute it foil it out you know you've got this right you know you've gotve done that uh the first thing you should be getting is a one yes then you're going to get plus Co sin x and you're going to get minus cosine X do you see that what's going to happen to those middle terms they're gone so we we're going to have one and then lastly you're going to do cosine x cosine X is that going to be a plus or minus minus what cosine not just cosine x cosine oh now here's the deal using your massive knowledge of trig identities some of you have and some of you don't have right now to be the Brut honest truth uh what is 1 - cosine 2 x equivalent to using the Pythagorean identity oh you do have that knowledge that's awesome very good if you know that that's right because listen if sin s+ cosine s = 1 if that's true which it is true and if I try to make this out of this thing that would be subtracting cosine right from both sides if I do that we make up another identity we make up the identity 1 - c^ 2 X is equivalent to sin^2 X therefore this thing is equivalent to s^ s x can you follow so far now we're going to do a little bit of algebraic manipulation I have gone from this I multiply by the conjugate I've used the Pythagorean identity in a unique way to get sin^2 X I haven't done much with this at all I just said x * 1 + cosine X you follow so far now because this is a limit I can split up limits by multiplication true so I'll show you every step by step watch what we could do here with our sin squ x I know that I could make this limit of sin x * sin x is that not still sin^2 X okay again as X approaches zero and then this thing I'm not going to distribute that I'm going to not distribute it for a very specific reason check this out this is the same thing as X Time 1 + cosine X so I haven't really changed that at all whatsoever you still okay with this you sure raise your hand if you are if you all right with that good okay basically I'll just wrote here's the idea look at because we can separate limits by multiplication check out what we can do I can group together because it just fractions this thing and this thing do you see it does that thing look familiar yeah so if we group it then this is going to be the limit as X approaches zero of sin x x x time the limit as X approaches Z of sin x over 1+ cosine X very brief recap very brief we multiply by the conjugate what that does is creat a sin s x for us the sin s x can be split up into sin x * sin x the x * 1 + cosine X we don't change that at all what we do is we group it in a certain way so that we can use a previously known identity that we have proven that's okay we're using something we've already proven so now we have a limit of x sin xx and a limit of sinx over 1 plus cosine X it's okay to split up limits by multiplication I taught you that property are you still okay with this proof so far all right can you tell me how much is the limit as X approaches Z of sinx beautiful we just did that right we just did that that's fantastic so this is one times now what I want you to do is I want you to try to evaluate this limit at zero are you going to have a problem with that are you going to have a problem why not why don't you have a problem now what's sign of zero good is it okay to have zero on the numerator yeah sure does it to make zero on the denominator no cuz you have 1 plus how much 1 plus 1 that's two you have 0 over two this is 0 over two I agree so how much is 0 over two what's 1 * 0 don't say one how much is one time zero Z what that says to us is we've just proved something else we now have this identity that's identity the first one we did number one this is the second one the limit as X approaches 0 1 - cosine XX is z interesting you know maybe you can remember it this way well I do at least I remember it this way so something involving s gives you one something involving cosine gives you zero that's kind of interesting right because usually it's if s gives you zero cosine gives you one right if cosine gives you One S gives you zero it's almost the same idea here the S one is giving you one the cosine one is giving you zero it's kind of cool right same sort of relationship is how I remember at least would you like to do the tangent one tangent one's even a little bit quicker actually much quicker let's try to find Tan x overx now could you just plug in the zero what's tangent of zero what's tangent of zero zero because sign is zero and cosine would be one that would be zero but now you have over Z so you have 0 over Z again so we do need to manipulate it but here's what we can do how much is T as the identities say it is so over cosine so we could make this that are you okay with that one so far if we do a little bit of work with this just a little little bit remember this is like uh X over one you're going to instead of dividing reciprocate and multiply true so this would be the same thing as the limit X approach zero of sin x over cosine X time 1/x still true still true now all in going to do because of the commutativity of multiplication and what we can do with fractions I'm going to Interchange this with that is that okay with you just going to flip them why does it matter the order in which we multiply and this is fractions right so I can make everything one fraction true so that means I could make it one fraction commute the denominators and then split it back up again so that means I okay that's the limit X approaches zero of sin XX * 1 over cosine X I've just switched those two things and that's fine you can do that because multiplication is commutative and you can make one fraction out of that by multiplication see anything interesting have you seen that we're trying to get this thing all the time because we know what that is do you see the sinx overx we can still split up the limits so this would be the limit X approaches 0 of sin XX * the limit X approaches 0 of 1 over cosine X interesting interesting hey now that you have this memorized I hope you do what's the limit as X approaches zero don't read the board right is right up there just kind of hopefully you memorize it already limit as X approaches Z sin XX what is that so this one is one times can you plug in the zero now sure what's cosine of zero it's one yeah what's one over one okay what's 1 * 1 you said one a lot today haven't you that means the limit X approaches Z of tan x x = 1 just like that just like that one did interesting like it so far there's basically three things we need to know these are three limits we need to know of we need to know the limit as X approaches 0 sin XX 1 we know the limit as X approach 0 1 - cos x x that equal 0 and tan XX = 1 again if you know those limits you can break down all the ones I'm going to give you into those three identities if you can do that that this is is very easy to master but it involves some thinking outside the box box in certain cases would you like to see some examples of how to do that okay let's start over here just memorize those three properties of of limits all right those are the proofs that we just did also I'll say it's got to fit those pretty darn perfectly in order to be true all right so let's start with some examples you're going to see some interesting mathematics this is kind of thinking outside the box we're trying to make these things fit in the format that I just gave you okay one of those three formats of of limits we'll start there now firstly is this exactly like the limit that I gave you what's different about this two is a problem two is a problem what we need to do somehow is we need to make the inside angle the same thing as the denominator so for instance if I have a 2X inside my angle I need a 2x on the bottom of my fraction you with me on that you got to have that otherwise it's not exactly the same you can't do that limit I'll show you how to do this in just a second so since we have this maybe we can do something a little bit special the only thing we can really do is multiply by one right that that's it otherwise we change the value of the limit but maybe we can multiply by one in a special way for instance what if I said you know what I want to multiply by one but I'm going to make it 2 over two is that legal to do okay let's see what we can do with this thing now you can put the twos anywhere you want to provided you don't change this a lot of people when they're first starting out in trigonometry hope hopefully this is not you they go well let's just pull the two out front wouldn't that be easy two time no you can't do that that you can't do that right that that is 2x you can't change that unless you use an identity to do that the double angle or the half angle or what whichever ones that you you can manipulate those the only ways you can change your sign of of the inside of the angle okay you can't just pull out that two it doesn't work but we can choose to put these twos anywhere we want so what I'm going to do is I'm going to say all right let's be smart about this now this two maybe I put it in front of my sign but this two let's make that 2x you okay with that so far you see where the twos went now here's something cool do you remember that anytime I have a function multiplied by a function I can split off the limit of that function we we've done that a couple times right here right we did that but with a constant the limit of of a constant is always just that constant let me explain that again when you have a limit of a function times a function you can break it up the limit of a constant is always the limit I'm not teaching anything we haven't had before what that says in plain English is you can always pull out a constant to the front of a limit because the limit of a constant is that constant you are you with me on that so basically pull the two out that's what you can do that two right here I can bring that up front so two times this now some of you might be thinking well wait Mr Leonard why why didn't you also pull this two out why didn't you do that well if I if I had what's 2 over two then I'm right back to where I started right that would be silly I'm doing this on purpose purp so I can make these two things look identical and multiply it by the number that's basically just left over raise your hand if you can follow that feel okay with it all right now here's a cool deal how much is s of 2x over 2x you know how much is sign of limit of uh s of X overx as X approaches zero one one now here's why this is also one you could actually make a substitution check it I'll show this only one time just so you see it once but let's make a dummy substitution like U = 2x you okay with that tell me something as X goes to zero does U also go to zero yes yes it does because if you plug in zero here you get a zero there as well right that means you can make the substitution for the limit so if I make this substitution then this limit now becomes U is going to zero s of well instead of 2x I put U instead of 2x I put U do you see how that now fits our identity perfectly you can do that provided your your b or your your variable still goes to the same spot it's still going to zero because when 2x is zero U is also zero it's still going to the same spot does that make sense to you so we can do this this go oh yeah this is one therefore this is one that's our substitution that's kind of neat so then we have 2 * 1 what's our limit how much two two two can you almost see it though in the original problem s of 2xx how much is it not one it's two what's inside the angle besides the X two interesting isn't it are you ready to make these a little bit more advanced a little bit more advanced start build them up a little bit this was very basic very very basic we're going to start incorporating some other ideas in here so how about just little by little though don't worry now but I got to warn you I'm going to cut out some of the steps I've already covered in the class so for instance I'm not going to ever show you the squeeze theorem for sin x over anymore CU we've already done that I'm probably not going to show you this whole routine for getting that answer anymore does that make sense to you probably not going to show that to you anymore um maybe one maybe once more but after that I'm just going to assume that you you can see that and then you can get there on your own is that fair I hope so cuz that's what I'm going to do oh well this is kind of nasty does this look like any of our identities so far we've only got three of does it look like any of them you got to make it fit one you got to make it fit one of those which one's it's closest to the tangent one the cosine one or the S one it's closest to the sign one but I need to have s over an X true okay is there anything we could do specifically can I multiply by one one something numerator denominator that's exactly the same that's going to give me something over X something over X stunk job remember that you can incorporate new variables as well provided that you multiply or you divide and gives you one I want this thing over X and this thing over X that's what I want can you make it happen here x overx close very close so we know we're going to need to incorporate another X you agree with that right somewhere the x is going to have to happen oh okay so if I listen If I multiply by just an X I get X sign right I don't want that I want overx how we get overx say it again how about 1X is that legal to do is this still one okay let's see what that does to our problem if you multiply s of 5x * 1X you're going get S of 5xx are you okay with that algebraic step what's this one going to be so we're we're multiplying in such a way that we can find some resemblance to an ident identity that we already have here we've chosen to multiply 1X over 1X which is legal to do because this is basically just one it's just one we're doing it so that we get sin x overx you seeing the point here you sure now are you going to be able did were you able to think of that on your own no but now you can use it right now you can use it in some of your problems hey using what we found out here can you tell me what the limit of this thing is going to be why is it five could I do the same thing here um remember I can separate limits by division right so I write limit over limit I can do that so if I multiplied 5 over five like I multiply 2 over two ultimately I'm going to have five times this limit where the 5x and 5x is the same I'm going to have 6 times this limit where the 6X and the 6X are the same I'm going to have that if you want to see it for the last time this is what it would be you'd say oh okay let's do 5 over five let's do 6 over 6 I'm going to do a couple steps at once right now I'm going to break those limits up I'm going to say okay I want the limit 5 sin 5x over 5x I want limit 6 sin 6X over 6X can you make it that far you guys are right with that one yes no what can you do what can you do with this five and with that six what can you do with them outside the limit you can because they're constants and we know that the constants really don't affect the limit because you can separate by multiplication and you'd be okay this is all multiplication that's great so this would be now 5 * the limit s of 5x over 5x as X approaches 0 notice how I'm still writing the limit all over 6 * the limit as X approaches 0 S of 6X over 6X do you see what we've done we basically put two ideas together we put this idea that I need sinx over X we put this idea that I can multiply by some constants and manipulate them in order to get my exact identity out of that now I'm not going to show you the substitution again basically I want you to know that a substitution is possible in these cases how much is the S of 5x over 5x how much one this is this is one right here this limit is one whenever your angle matches your denominator with that sign and your limit is going to zero that angle or that limit is one how much is this limit right here so you have 5 * 1 you have 6 * 1 what's your answer 56 we have that made sense to you you okay with that one all right good you want to try a few more it's kind of fun I like them teach you a little bit about trigonometry won't it or at least refresh your memory about someon and learn some things you can do with limits which are pretty cool [Applause] oh let's see about this does this look similar to one of our our limits that we already knew how to do is it exactly the same though what's different about it it's got X squar now again can you change the inside of your limit or I'm sorry the inside of your sign can you change the inside of your sign so basically can I change the x s never can't change that thing unless you use identity that's the only time you can do that you can't just say I think I'll pull an X out and put it there no you can't no no you don't what you want to do is make it so that if you haven't noticed this in the previous two examples make it so this angle matches your denominator what do you need to multiply by to make your angle match your denominator cuz that's what we did here multiply to make your angle equal to your denominator multiply to make your angle equal to your denominator that's where the five came from what do you need to multiply by X overx would work so keeping with what we know this x I can't do much with that besides put it out in front of my limit so right here I'll do okay I'm going to put that out in front but these two yes that's what I want because what what I want I want that angle and that denom to be exactly the same you all right with this so far now because limits are separable by a multiplication I can say well this is just multiplication I can separate off a limit of x so this would be a limit of x as X approaches Z times the limit sin x^2 x^2 as X approaches 0 hey tell me something what's the limit of x as X approaches zero it's not x z zero because you plug that in you get zero times what's the limit of sin x^2 X2 as X approaches zero one yeah because you could make that same substitution like we well I had on the board earlier for a dummy variable equals X2 right and then as x s goes to zero so does that variable and so does this uh this variable it would be like a u you would be going to zero as these two things also went to zero that matches our our identity perfectly this goes to one and as I've said anytime your angle matches up with your denominator you can do that so you pull out that absolutely because it's not a constant it's not a constant yeah the only reason that that's a great point the only reason why we were able to pull this constant out and leave this constant is because if you did this watch this if you did the limit as X approaches zero of that constant what's the limit of two no matter what you're going to right that's why we can do it okay let's continue on with this what's 0 * 1 our limit of x2x sin x^2 x as x 0 is0 we'll try um try a few more of these I really want to make sure you get the handle on this because there's a lot of different combination and problems we can do so I'm going to give you as many as I can in the time that we have that way you feel a little bit more comfortable on your homework you ready for them so again some other examples [Applause] hey by the way is this the same thing as this this the same as that s of x s is that same thing as Sin s x what's sin s x mean good maybe you can see where this is going so that's true you're always trying to break it into limits you know limits you understand what's the limit of sin x/x this is going to give you one what's s x what's the limit of sin x as X approaches zero it's zero because when you plug in the zero you get zero so this is ultimately going to be 1 * 0 or 0 this limit if I I'm not showing you a step right here I'm not actually breaking them up if I were to break them up the limit of this would be one limit of this would be zero 1 * 0 is 0 that one now we we're going to talk about this I'm not going to prove it to you why it doesn't exist you can you can uh get there on your own or or you can look I think the book has a proof in it it's pretty good I'm going to do this graphically just to show you what this looks like now of course sign is an oscillating function right goes up and down up and down up and down one overx as you get close to zero goes to Infinity right it goes there very fast so what happens with this graph it looks like this sure it tops out at one and it pops out at negative one because sign is bounded in those ranges this looks something like this starts off nice it goes down it goes up and down and up and down and up and down and as it get closer it goes faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster faster till a bunch of crap happens it's by the End by the time it gets to zero it's like that does it ever get to zero no you tell me can you plug in zero no then it never gets there it's undefined at that point you can't do it cannot do it so it just goes nice and slow and then faster faster faster faster faster F until it gets nowhere the other side looks like this as we get closer to zero are you approaching a certain point or is it just continuing to oscillate like that it's not actually reaching a point it's not gonna it's not gonna ultimately go oh I'm gonna I'm gonna level out and make zero or I'm gonna level out and make it's not doing that as you get closer it's still oscillating even faster and faster and faster by the end it's just crazy all right you can't even you can't see it it's going so fast so is the limit going to exist answer is no no it doesn't exist that one does not exist sign of one re does if you ever see that just sign of one of Rex that doesn't exist okay so question this is an interesting question if that doesn't exist Does that exist does that exist oh as we approach let me get my white cat and smoke it did you see that commercial with that creepy guy with the white cat I don't know what that was yeah it was but it was like on the Super Bowl I think it was CEO you know who CEO iseven I Was Made I was forced to watch The Voice last night that's the only forced forced yeah not like handcuffed or anything but like it was on and of course if it's on I have to watch it so it is anyway does that exist let me show you something again we're going to use the squeeze theem are we going to prove the squeeze theem no no we're going to use the squeeze the check this out this is interesting uh do you agree that oh by the way I did make a mistake on the previous squeeze theorem using the squeeze theorem um I was supposed to have the equal signs underneath it I neglected that for some reason I don't know why I did that but with your squeeze theem you do have to have those symbols not those symbols I think I set it towards the very last bit of the proof I said you know what I'm supposed to have these everywhere but I don't know if you caught that let's use some of our knowledge about sign to create some bounds on sign forget the one /x part for a second what's the maximum value you can attain with sign what's the highest sign goes one what's the lowest sign goes so you agree that's true right true okay we'll check this out I'm now going to create this in here by multiplying all three of these sections by X is that legal to do sure yeah so if I multiply by X actually I think I yeah I do I want the absolute value of x because I don't want to change those signs so I'm going to make sure I multiply by the absolute value of x okay so here's a slightly better interpretation of what's actually going on in the problem we're working on right here we're trying to work on the limit as X approaches zero of sin 1X * X now of course we know that sign is bound between 1 and - 1 s doesn't get any bigger than one doesn't get any less than 1 so we can go naturally make this an equality any sign function is between -1 and 1 including s of 1 /x so we have that down can't get bigger than one can't get less than one now the way we make the jump from here to here which in class I have absolute value around this X and I said we can get there by multiplying this absolute value of x and this absolute value of x and this absolute value of x which is true but it doesn't quite give us back exactly what we want which is X without the absolute value how we get there is just by a little bit of little rational thought so we say if we multiply by X in all three spots what could potentially happen is if I don't have these absolute values I could get a negative number over here which wouldn't be an upper bound so what we're saying is let's make this one absolute value of x that way we know that that's always going to be positive no matter what I plug in I have positive X well that's certainly going to be bigger than x s of 1/x if this is true then this has to be true where X is positive also if we let X be negative we're going to have to have a lower bound now if I don't have this absolute value what that says a negative times a negative could actually get me a positive I don't want that to happen I want a legitimate lower bound so that's where the absolute value is coming from that says all right well then x s of 1x certainly has to be bigger than that negative number if this is true then this one also has to be true and that makes our double inequality here from there it's a simple matter of limits we say well we know the limit as X approaches zero of the absolute value of x that's going to zero we know that that's that's that V curve as we're going from both sides the height that function is getting down to zero so that limit exists it's zero same thing the limit of negative absolute value of x that's negative absolute value of x we're going up to a height of Zero from both sides that limit zero so we we have the limit of this function is zero the limit of this function is zero since we've now squeezed our function we wanted to find out this one since we squeeze that between two functions whose limit is zero as we approach Zero by The Squeeze theorem we can now draw that conclusion that's how we get the limit as X approaches Z of x s of 1 /x equals z does the limit only exist because you have an X in front of the S one /x yeah okay and which is interesting because that little that X right there in front of it allows you to bound it between two numbers and then use that fact to say the limit of this goes to something Li of this goes to something the problem is if you look at this one just thetive one sin 1/x less than one where's this limit go where's this limit go are they the same then you haven't squeezed it that's the problem we need that X to say okay by multiplying by well the absolute value of x which which is a small point but multiply by absolute value of x the limit of the absolute value of x yes that is going to zero and the absolute value of x yes that is going to zero that is what actually squeezes it that's the point without the X you can't do it it fails here it doesn't work here if works here this is another one that we can use limit of x sin x or sin 1X that does exist it actually equals zero it's an interesting thing just by having that X in there so our whole idea for this is you're trying to break up these limits into the identities that you the limit identities that we can work with the ones we've already know that's the sinx overx goes to one and the 1 - cosine X overx goes to zero and the Tan x overx goes to one again that's what we're trying to do um I think I have three or four more examples would you like to see some other things that we can do okay I'm gonna I'm going to have to kind of paraphrase these for you because I just want to give you the the head start on them some of these are are in your homework as a matter of fact of think but I want to give you some key points so that you can do these on your own so I'll be moving kind of quickly uh follow along if you're not quite getting to see see me in the math lab I'll be there often or my office hours or check out these videos again later on see that you can follow these on your own you with me on that so A couple of things that we can do this is basically just practice at this point you've learned everything we need to know okay while this looks kind of nasty I want you to see that we can actually do a lot of fun things with this firstly do you see how we have a few cosiness up there we're probably going to be moving towards the cosine limit that we we learned about so if we do that well what I want out of that limit is the oneus the cosine true overx I've already got the overx but I don't have the one however what I can do with that number two can I separate that into 1 + 1 is 1+ 1 the same thing as two sure so then this is really check out what I'm going to do I'm say this is really 1 + 1 I'm going to reorganize the stuff then and say this is the limit as X approaches Z of 1 - cosine 3x + 1 - cosine 4X all over X does that work for you is that still the same exact thing just reorganized it now what's cool about fractions is that if you have a common denominator you can add them right and subtract them what it also means you can pull them apart by that common denominator so what that says is I can actually make this 1 - cosine of 3x/ x well there's one of them but now I have the common denominator plus 1 - cosine of 4X x wouldn't those be different limits though and then you're adding them together we are adding two different limits right now we're not there yet but that's a good point we can split up those limits by addition right so we now have two different limits oh now what can we do now what can we do we can do that what we want is the angle to be the same same as our denominator so if we do that if we do the 3 over3 thing and the 4 over4 thing move those numbers out front don't affect this one minus cosine of that that uh that angle then we'll be okay then that's going to allow us to do that substitution just like we did for the sign did you follow that so we want 1 minus cosine of an angle over the same angle basically down on the denom that's what we're looking for here so if I multiply this by * 3 over 3 * 4 over 4 all this becomes is 3 * the limit X goes to Z of 1 - cosine of 3x over 3x plus 4 * the limit 1 - cosine of 4X that's hard to draw 4X so we do the same exact idea that we did for our sign only here can you tell me what's the limit as X approaches Z of 1us cosine of some angle over that same angle how much is that that's the zero so we have 3 * 0 plus 4 * what's that one going to be we do that substitute again just like we we learned for signs so 3 * 0 4 * 0 what's the answer I know right all that time spent and nothing zero you should should have seen the looks on my my math C kids when I I did a whole problem using rational functions took about 10 minutes and then the solution didn't work out because it made the denominator equal zero and they're like wait there's no solution like yeah isn't that exciting they're like I hate you oh well okay other things you can do this is very similar uh Now understand that we were able to break up these fractions because we had that denominator we can do the same thing here so we could actually make this limit as X approaches Z of x^2 /x - 3 sin x overx you guys okay with that one yeah we can do things like that we can split up our limit using our algebra how much is x^2 x so we'd have a limit as X approaches Z of x - 3 * sin x/ X tell me what happens here tell me what happens where does The X go to Zero by the way the reason why we can do that is because we're not actually getting to zero right we can actually cross out the X and X that's okay so what's the limit of x is X approaches zero this is zero minus what's uh what's the limit of three is the three going to change now you you know I'm skipping steps here right you know that technically what we're supposed to do is is separate these by subtraction then separate these by multiplication but we found out that earlier with our pols if you can plug it in and you know the identities then you're going to be okay so here this goes to zero this three that's going to stay at three what's the limit of sin XX as X approaches zero what's my answer answer is3 would you ra have be okay with this one we'll practice a couple more next time I want to show you two other things we can do and that'll wrap it up so we're still learning how to do some problems involving trigonometric limits so when we deal with these limits our basic idea is you want to get it down to one of those three identities that we knew for limits uh namely sin x/x as X appr to 0 goes to oh boy one one very good okay somebody else one minus cosine x/ X as X goes to Zer goes to zero and tan XX oh good all right you got that one that's that's the one we don't use that often either oh nuts okay so basically we're trying to get those things in these problems some way or another now often times you'll have to use some sort of an identity to do some of these things so for instance when I look at this this top example t^2 over 1 - cosine 2 T if I plug in the T I have a problem because I have 0 over 0 do you see the0 over Z that's a problem but is there a way I can manipulate this in such a way to get rid of the 1us cosine s t that right there at this point for you who have taken math 2 our trigonometry you should that should be going oh yeah I know what that is what's 1us cosine squ T do you know sin Square t very good so I could change that now at this point there's a couple ways to go about doing this problem one option is do you see how I could break this up T * t s * s do you see that you could have t over sin * T over s you with me you can break each of those up as different limits each one of those limits would be going to one I I didn't say this to you but it should maybe have been apparent to you from the squeeze theorem that this limit is also equal to one was that apparent to you as well that's the same thing that's the same thing the reason is because when you do the squeeze theem instead of reciprocating if you left it alone you have that already that's that's in there when we proved it with the squeeze theorem also I can show it to you this way um do you remember that if you take out an exponent or you reciprocate a fraction you can actually have a negative exponent some of you zoning out already let me let me show you what I mean maybe let's make more sense if I flip these around but make it netive 1 that's the same thing as that do you remember that reciprocation of a fraction changes the sign of your exponent if that's to the first Power I can reciprocate those fractions make to negative first Power yes I can pull out a negative I pull out any exponent right so I could have a limit of sinx overx that's one 1 to the 1 still gives you back one either way that's one so in our case up here we could do it that way that I explained earlier we could break this up as T sin T * T sin T each of those is going to give us a limit of one are you with me on that one * 1 our our ending limit this should equal one but I want to show you the different way to do this that's one option do you see the option that you do that the other option is well if you did something similar with that exponent I could say that this is the limit as T approaches zero since the numerator squared and the denominator squared I can break that exponent out to the top you with me on that one sure okay also if I change the sign of that exponent I can reciprocate my fraction do you follow that one so this says all right well then why don't you just make it limit T approaches zero of sin t/ T that's something we want but now since I reciprocated the fraction I have it to the negative2 power what we can do with the ne2 power is pull that exponent outside of our limit now we're home free do you need me to recap here a little bit Yeah okay recap still get a kick out of that every time trig identity youall need to know that one taking an exponent out it's very similar to this if you have x^2 over y^2 that is X over y squ agreed then this is similar to this if I reciprocate the fractions y /x then that's just -2 that's exactly what I have done here and then there true properties of limits say that if you have a function raised to some power it's the same thing as a limit of that function raised to that power so basically says I can raise the limit to the power instead of raising the function to the power and then taking the limit so in other words that's possible pull out the exponent take the limit first first and then do the exponent you okay with that one that's the recap now what's the limit as T approaches zero of sin t/ T so you all agree that's one right what's one to the2 power one it is just one yeah anything to one to any power gives you one so this is going to give you one you okay with that one well that was fine any questions on the first one is it only one if it's approaching zero or can it be approaching another number that's a good question if it's approaching any other number besides zero well then okay the only difference on this one for like right right here if it's approaching number besides zero well then s is actually a number right so you can plug that in and be just fine you wouldn't have to do any of this uh the only time that really matters is if the S of T is zero which happens at Z and then pi and then 2 pi again for this example here it would really matter unless T goes to zero so that that's our our situation so if T any if T is anything else besides zero you don't even have an issue remember I said you should always plug in the number first to make sure you even have an issue so if this was like going to one or well let's make it better Pi / 2 you go let's let's do pi over 2 do I need to have a limit Identity or anything no you just do s of pi over two over pi over two and that will actually work out for you be 1 over pi over 2 or two over Pi that would be your answer so you wouldn't have to do any of this stuff if you have a number besides zero are you with me on that it all goes back to you should try your limit before you start doing fan this is fancy stuff try your limit before you do fancy stuff plug in the number if you don't have a problem then that's your limit if you do have a problem then do fancy stuff fancy stuff my fancy hands okay does that answer your question though yeah all right let's try the next one now let's practice this then are you going to have a problem if you plug in zero What's the numerator become zero oh good we got that one what's the denominator become this is pi over two right pi over 2us 0 is pi over 2 right what's cosine of pi/ 2 I'll give you a hint start with the Z and rhymes with Hero Zero yeah it's zero you get zero over zero that's a problem so to answer your question again would you could you if you if that wasn't zero if it was something else could you potentially just plug in the number without doing any of this fancy stuff where about to do absolutely but now that we have 0 over Z this is where you have to use those limits and identities to get something you know what's the things you know you know the limit of sin x/x as X approaches zero is 1 you know the limit of 1 - cosine XX as X approaches Z is z and you know that uh the limit of tan XX as X approaches 0 is one again that's the only things you know so if you can't do the limit directly you try to make it into one of those things you follow me on that okay so what can we do someone who's really good at identities tell me what that is I'll take care of the numerator for you all right here you go boo do the denominator what's cosine of 12 Pi minus X it's a special little thing half angle identity yeah oh man you guys are killing me you guys killing me know your double angles your half angles your pythagoreans and the tangent ones okay know what secant cosecant cotangent mean and you'll be okay those are the basic ones you need to have those down what this says if you want to check in the back of your book cosine of 12 pi x or minus your angle whatever that that happens to be whatever variable you have that's equal to sinx that's it this is sinx did that make your problem easier much easier right if you try messing around with this one you're like I have no idea what what's Mr Leonard going to do there this is crazy stuff but that's actually just an identity do you know how much this is limit of x over sinx as X approaches zero it is one yes we actually just talked about that one one and done cool yeah okay so do you sometimes need some identities to do these problems yes you do if you be good at identities in this class not a professional otherwise you'd be teaching but relatively okay okay you need to at least know them and how to how to use them that's why I had you do that that identity section right so that was heads up on you should do this now most of you skipped those problems don't problems uh mostly you skip those problems but you you should have the idea that yeah we're going to be using this in class and it's somewhat helpful unless you just want to spend massive amounts of time banging your head literally against the wall and pulling your hair out I don't want you to go bald so learn your learn your identities and then you get a little bit easier okay now our last one that we're going to do in dear again I can't give you every example but I've given you quite a few I think you'll agree what can we do with that what do you think any ideas we did something with 1us cosine earlier in the class maybe that would work conjugate conjugate conjugate yeah let's conjugate it why don't you multiply by the conjugate right now I'm going to walk you through this one multiply by the conjugate of 1 minus cosine Theta do them both the numerator denominator uh again what's the conjugate uh of this that I'm talking what how do you find the conjugate basically change change the sign okay so what is the conjugate specifically for us you got to do it on both the numerator and denominator you okay so far we don't necessarily have to distribute the numerator I'm going to leave that alone in case we absolutely have to later what I do need to do is distribute the denominator you follow so let's try that so we're going to have the limit th approaches Z Theta squ 1 + cosine thet can you tell me how much this is going to give you when you do your your distribution what are you going to [Music] get one hey we've seen this already how much is 1 - cosine squ still okay so far are you okay so far with that give me a little head knot if you are yeah okay good do you see anything we can do now what do you think do just see anything looks familiar in this problem what looks familiar maybe that we've done earlier in this class that you Coulda squ you see theeta Square sin squ right we just did that it's right here we've done that problem so what I want you to do right now is break that up I want this the Theta squ over sin squ times the remaining well we'll talk about that in a second right now all I care about is that you see that this right here is going to go together do you see it's going to go together and it's going to be multiplied by 1 + cosine th do you all have that in your paper right now you seen how to if you didn't get that you seen how to get that yes no it's okay if it's a no but I need to know it's a no it's it okay or not yeah not so much this is like uh Co this is like over one right if you multiply numerator time numerator and denominator time denominator it will give you back that thing therefore we can split it up uh in the opposite manner okay now what can you do with limits that are being multiplied together can you split them up by multiplication can you split them up by do that now make two limits out of it limit of this one time the limit of this one do that for me also one little piece of information when you're doing these limits you have a lot going on make sure you're putting the parentheses around the argument of your limit just to make sure that you know I'm taking the limit of this whole thing not just a limit of one and then adding cosine Theta does that make sense to you make sure you see that did you make it this far okay now since we've already proven this we already know how much this limit is how much is this limit we can redo it if you really want to right pull out the two reciprocate it -2 uh 1 to the second power is still one so this thing is one now can you evaluate this limit at theta equals 0 is that okay to do now sure you have no denominator that's fine plug in the zero and do that on your own notice how I'm not writing limit anymore this limit is equal to 1 time this limit is equal to 1 + cosine of 0 since Theta is zero notice how you still need par because you're multiplying one * something that's okay how much is cosine of Z it is how much one cosine of 0 is 1 so what we have in here is 1 + 1 so 1 * 1 + 1 what's our limit equal to limit is two there are a couple different ways you could have done this you could have broken this up independently done a few different things this is probably in my opinion the most concise at least one I found it's most concise so do that and then we can do any limit as long as we're finding uh at least some identities that we've dealt with before inside of our limits and using those things how many people understood what we talked about so far our section how about this story are you guys all right with this any questions that we have before we continue all right finally done with Section 1.2 feel good it's good for me this thing was long my goodness 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 1.4:  Continuity of Functions
continuity here's the layman's term definition of continuity a function is continuous if it has no holes breaks or ASM tootes that's pretty much it if you can graph it by not picking your pencil off the paper you would say it's continuous so that that's what we're talking about so um continuity says curves continuous if it doesn't have any holes or breaks or Asm tootes now would you like me to give you a more precise definition than that holes brakes and astes yes that's understandable right though hopefully it doesn't have any holes in it it doesn't have a gap and it doesn't have any ASM tootes in it that if you don't have those things then it's continuous everywhere if you do have those things it' be continuous most places just not at those specific points here's what continuity is mathematically though so more specifically a function is continuous if three things happen first oh sorry you know what and let me say uh at a point I need to add that on there otherwise it's not going to really make a lot of sense so continuous at a point C if so continuous at Point C if firstly I hope this makes sense to you firstly if the function is defined at that point this has to exist how can you have continuity if the point doesn't exist does that make sense to you so it's it we' say it's continuous at some point C if you can plug in C and you get out a point that's what that says in English so if F of C is defined you plug in C you get out a point that's what that means number two number two the limit has to exist at that point so that means that the function is from the both from both sides around Point C remember Point C is like your input right around Point C the function is going no matter what to the same spot does that make sense it can't go like this that wouldn't be continuous because you have that jump you with me so the limit has to exist and around that point C so not only does c have to be fine have to Define the limit of FX as X approaches C must exist and thirdly this thing has to equal this thing so f a function f is continuous at Point a or at Point C if three things happen firstly the point exists what this means again last time is if you plug in C you get something out secondly the limit exists that means the function is going to the same place from left to right as you approach C thirdly where you approach is this point that's what that says where you approach is that point so it means the function's going to a point the point exists and it's right between where the the functions okay that's that's what that says if that happens what that means is you're going along a function you to a point you fill in the point you keep on going make sense so there's no hole there there's no ASM toote um and that that also works for ASM tootes right even the limit existed in Infinity there's no point at Infinity saying you would have a break you can't make that little jump let me give you some pictorial examples on on what this looks like you ready for it so let's try to apply this the question I'm going ask you to to this over here where I told you about continuity so number one uh does the point exist at xal C is there a point there so already we fail number one that right there says you're not going to be continuous because you fail number one uh is number two satisfied though does the limit exist yes it's going to the same value from left to right so limit's there but when you ask this question is the limit equal to the function value no because it's there's a hole it's not even there so there is no point number one fails and therefore number three fails this is not continuous so we'd say it's not continuous wait all over the place is it not continuous all over the place at C is it continuous here absolutely actually most of this function is continuous it's just that little Point that's not continuous what this is called when you have a hole remember talking about holes it's called a removable discontinuity so this is not continuous at C and we call it a removable discontinuity what that basically says is you have a hole a removable discontinuity is a discontinuity that you could fill in with a single point let's try another one let's check our three Necessities for our limit to for our function to be continuous at a point C firstly is number one satisfied do we have a point at C yes yes we do is number two satisfied does a limit exist no limit exist says we're going to the same spot it means it has to look like this together does it look like that it looks like this right that's a problem so does this side meet up with this side if it doesn't then the limit doesn't exist so is number two satisfied no if number two is not satisfied number three can't possibly be satisfied because this is non-existent so this fails continuity so we'd say yeah this is not continuous at C for sure it's not continuous uh but is it a removable discontinuity or not no even if I put another point up there it's not going to make a difference right not going to be able to continue my function with one single point this one I could just put it right there you you're good to go it's like a fill in the hole but here you can't do that this is not removable this is like a jump continuity you're jumping from point to point or from one part of the function to another jumpity or I don't know what if they call it a jump continuity book it might but that's what you're you're doing is you're jumping so we'll say that's a jump discontinuity this one's removable discontinuity how about this one let's check our three statements number one is the function defined at Point C is the function defined at Point C really defined you can plug in C and get a point no no what if I did this I said okay there is the function defined at Point C yes yes it is now there is a point you plug in C you get that specific point you with me does the limit ex so number one is satisfied is number two satisfied does the limit exist are you going to the same spot from left to right going to Infinity yes limit exists so number one is satisfied and number two is satisfied would you agree with that this is why we need number three is number three satisfied does the limit equal the value of the function the limit equals infinity the value of the function equals this right here are those the same thing so number three fails so we've had a case where number one fails we're number two fails and now we're number three fails so you see those those those examples yes this is called an infinite discontinuity so we'll say this is at infinity or infinite hey what about this one what if I put a point if I if I put a point up here but it didn't close in the circle would that be continuous at that point no it would still jump that's still removable discontinuity though if I redefine the point so if I say okay you know what I'm just going to move this point from here to here redefine it that we'd say that's still a removable discontinuity how many people understand the different terms that we we have here so basically we have three different uh kinds of discontinuities those that have asmp tootes those that are are jumps and those that are holes we mostly deal with these two this one would be like a pie wise function we we are mostly over here when we're dealing with rational functions uh that's usually we have stuff we can cross out what we have that so we can cross uh where we get rid of the the problem in our limit and stuff that we can't cross out where we do a sign analysis test I've showed you both of those things before do you remember them all right shall we check let's check some functions to see if we can tell whether they're continuous or not are there any questions about our our Necessities for continuity here or these graphs over here okay yes when you said that when you had the point on the first one sure uh below the hole yeah and you said you could move it up to the hole in this we'd have to well not move it up to the hole we're redefining we're saying this would be a piecewise function right now or some very special function we redefine this in some way so that this is no longer here but it fits in that hole that's called the removal discontinuity we've removed this point and placed it in the hole basically we've re defined it somehow but keep in mind you are redefining your function just a little bit okay so we're going to ask are these following functions continuous at x = 2 [Applause] oops let's see so first one how about f ofx is that continuous at xals 2 basically can you is it defined at xal 2 is what you would check first is it defined at xal 2 can you plug in two and get something out so that would fail this is not continuous in fact if you remember we I think we've had this problem one very very similar to it what this is by the way uh can you determine whether that's a whole or ASM toote could you figure that out why is it a hole it does yeah this is X+ 2x - 2 so your function is really x + 2 do you see where the X plus 2 is coming from use your difference of squares cross out your x - 2 you're going to get x + 2 that's really what this function is it well at least that's what it looks like is x + 2 only when I plug in two so if I cross those out I'd say well yes FX = x + 2 but I hope you remember what I told you about domain domain has to be from the original function not your brand new function remember what we talked about that so X can't be defined a two we tried that up here it didn't work what this says is if I were able to plug in two if if I were able to plug in two how much would I get out of it four four now am I able to plug in two so what that says is if I were able to plug in two and I got out four I have a ho at 2 comma 4 can you make that jump you okay with that idea that says all right normally I would be this function but I know I can't plug in two that means I can't get out the number four I can't get out that value just to re force a concept would this be continuous at xal 1 how about xal 5 how about any other point besides two absolutely we're just talking about two right now now let's move over to the next function and these look confusing but here's all this says this says for everywhere except two you're now this thing we we have that here but now at two I have a three so let's check the continuity now is number one satisf is the function uh is the function defined at my point xal 2 absolutely it's right here that's that's the definition uh is does the limit exist Does the limit exist yes the limit exists the limit exists but now this point is three so when I go over two it says I'm at three that's what this one is right now so it says is the is the function defined at the point absolutely does the limit exist for my function around that point yes it does is the limit equal to the function value so is this one continuous no no everywhere else yes but not here so no no that be a jump or this would be a removable discontinuity I'm going to show you why right now okay so firstly we try to point right we have this function and we have this hole in it so if I cover that up this is my original f ofx true I tried to plug in a point did I make it fit right no it doesn't fit right let's try the next one h of X says okay now it looks almost identical to G of X except instead of having it xal 2 to find at 3 we have x = 2 defined at four tell me does the four fill in the hole yes so by making a piecewise function and Def finding just one single point we go oh well how about this is the function defined at that point yes it is does the limit exist at that point yes it does is the function equal to the Limit yes that means all three qualifications for having continuity of that point therefore we say yes that's a removable discontinuity means you you identify one point that fills in the hole okay if a function is continuous at each point between a certain interval like a B we can say it is continuous on the interval a so let's say if f is continuous at every point between a and b then f is continuous on a the open interval if F's continuous at every point that means like like over here between this range of numbers it's continuous at every single point right there's no jumps there's no holes there's no ASM tootes it is continuous we'd say it's it's continuous on the open interval the question I have is what about the end points and we're going to look at that right now so what would happen because right now this is open right it's not including the A and the B how can we determine whether or not to include those end points with brackets or or whether we can't and we'll look at that just Bri so F's continuous every Point okay we have f is continuous on the interval a but what about the end points and let's say this is our function hey would you say this function is continuous between A and B without including the end points for sure at every single point there there's nothing wrong with it now would you say it's continuous at the point B yeah the point's there right the point's there now we don't have have here here's a weird thing we don't have a full-on limit because we don't even have one side however the one-sided limit from the left goes to the same value that the point B is defined at does that make sense to you so it's going to the point and the point exists you with me how about the left hand side does the limit I'm sorry is it continuous at the point a at the point a the limit exists from the right sure the point exists but is the limit equal to the point then no this would be kind of like a jump right if I if I had this going this way that would be like a jump continuity you have that that point that's not there uh now it's that doesn't have that other side so we'd say this is continuous on how would we write that if it's continuous from A to B But it includes B and not a how how do I write that one bracket one parentheses sure so this is continuous on I know it goes from A to B again Does it include the B the B the B yes because the points there the limits there equals the same thing how do I show that is that the bracket or the parenthesis that's the bracket that says I include the point B now it can't include the point a because the limit exists from one side uhhuh the point is there sure but it's not the same in general here's what you have I'll give you more math mathematical definition of this in general here's what has to happen if it's it has to be continuous from the left at Point C or continuous from the right at Point C so for continuity from the left you'd have the limit as X approaches C from the left of f ofx pass to equal half of C that's very very similar to the third qualification for continuity that we just had only this time it's a one-side limit so basically we're just checking one side limits and making sure they they go to the the point that is defined and that the point is actually defined this is like the situation we have at point B okay the limit from the left exists the function at C in this case that's B okay the limit at the uh the function at the point exists and they are equal this is like the situation for point [Music] B like point B for being continuous to the other end point from the right at Point C well it's just opposite limit you have to have the limit from the right hand side the function has to be defined at that point and it's got to be the same this is like f of a the limit has to exist it does the point has to be defined it is but they would have to be identical so this is like the the point a situation in our case it's not continuous at the point a would you like to see an example on how to prove this with a closed interval okay I'll I'll show you how to do this it's a three-part it's not hard okay it's just three-part proof what we're going to do is we're going to prove continuity for an open interval which is relatively easy we're going to prove continuity for the left and the right intervals which are both relatively easy so we have basically three limits to do we we've got a pro continuity in the middle then Pro continuity at the end points so I'll write the question on the board and then we'll we'll go for that so I want to prove that this function is continous this on -4 to 4 inclusive Clos interval this again involves three parts the first step we've got to check the open interval got to check the open interval the next step is going to be check the right end point the next step is going to be check the left end point so I'll write these out and we we'll start here next time so the right end point would be pos4 from the left the left end point would be -4 from the right you going from the right on that we'll figure out how to do this next time I'll show you each little piece of this and we'll determine that it is in fact continuous from4 to 4 inclusively all right so hopefully you remember from last time we were working on this problem we want to prove that that particular function is continuous on a closed interval now in order to to figure out if a function is continuous on a closed interval we have to basically check three things we've got to check first the open interval to see if there's any holes or Asm tootes on that open interval the end points a little different though because when we check continuity we're really checking limits right right so we're checking limits and at an end point a fullon limit does not exist because there is no function coming from the left or or maybe the right hand side at a certain case so what we do at our end points is we check a one side limit so what that means is that sure we can check the limit on an open interval just fine because there's always a point to the right that means that we can always find the limit of that however when we talk about end points we've got to check oneid limits and just see if they they match up now it's not a hard thing so so don't think it's going to be super super hard it's just you have to do in three points to actually prove it right on that I'll show you how to do it you'll see it it's not really a hard hard thing to do uh first thing we're going to do is check the open interval -44 so we're going to check this thing to say that that okay at least we know we're continuous from this point to this point but not inclusively then we'll have to check the end point4 and we'll check the end point positive4 if we're going to check I want you to understand the notation here if we're going to check -4 understand that4 we're going to have to be coming from the right to check that do you understand that CU from the left nothing exists over here so we have to be coming from the right does that make sense for positive 4 that's over here we're going to have to be coming from the left that's where this from the left and from the right are coming from there is nothing to check over here it's from the left hand side there's we're saying the function we don't care about the other side of that do you understand the notation for our limits all right so let's do the open interval I'll show you how to do this it's really just a a very very basic Point uh proof here's how you start out what we want to prove is that the limit of f ofx equals F of C as X approaches C that's what we want if we can show that then we' prove that the limit exists the function exists and they equal each other that will prove the whole thing that that will be the three cases for continuity or the three points for continuity the limit exists the function exists and they equal each other you with me on that so let's do that what we're going to do is start here and try to work away to there so the limit as X approaches C of f ofx is really the same thing as the limit as X approaches C of the < TK of 16 - x^2 are you okay with that so far now given that c is some point between -4 and 4 given that c is some point between -4 and 4 can we plug in C and be okay what do you think let's say C was five would that be okay you'd have a negative inside your square root right that would be a problem but because C is between -4 and 4 are we going to have a negative inside of our square root okay so what we can say is that if C's between 4 and 4 for any c then this is possible here's where you make the jump if there's not going to be any issues in your specified open interval open domain then you can make the jump and say okay we can actually evaluate that limit at any point C do you believe me if I gave you any point between -4 and 4 could you plug it in and be okay absolutely here's what that says it says if Mr Leonard gives me any point I can plug it in and be okay where did the C come from it's not a trick question where the C come from yeah where's X approaching and you know for fact that C's between these numbers right that's what I'm I'm telling you here and you just told me that no matter what I gave you between there IE C no matter what I gave you you could plug it in right that's what you're saying here you're saying the limit is okay to evaluate because this is between those numbers I have no problem now check this out is this not F of C isn't that just F evaluated at C you've just proved it we've just proved that the limit of f of x as X C equals F of C we proved that that's checked for that that's all you got to do just make sure you take that plug in the C and see that it's exactly the same you okay with that one so far I hope so it's not you might think well that's kind of trivial it's really not trivial I mean we're we're actually thinking whether this Point's in there sure we're thinking whether it's going to have any problems it doesn't therefore we can take any c plug it in and that is f of C that's what we're trying to prove we're trying to get to this point so that does it for us now as far as the one side limits go as far as that goes if we're going to the right oh sorry from the right to4 we're getting really really really close to4 would it be okay if I just plugged in4 is what 16 4 s is that okay can you get a zero inside of the square root is that acceptable then yeah that that's a one side limit that's going to exist as well so this well this is going to equal zero that's equal zero you're going to plug well I I can show you extra step one you said it's okay to even evaluate that at four it exists the limit is going to exist one-sidedly from from the right that's the same thing as saying oh well that's 16 of negative sorry minus -42 that equals 0 which equals F of -4 because you're just plugging it in that's also saying the limit as X approaches a certain number in this case an end point is equal to the function's value at that point that's another check we can do exactly the same thing for four to the right if you plug in positive4 is that going to have an issue over here no that means that as we get closer and closer to positive4 this function is getting closer and closer to zero true so we can plug that that the one side limit is going to exist it says it's going to that value so this would be well < TK 16 - 4^ 2 which is zero which is exactly F of 4 that's what you're trying to prove you're trying to prove that I can plug in any number that's what that says and it equals the function at that value says I can plug in the end point look it this is what this says I can plug in the end point and it gives me f of when I plug in the end point that's all I'm saying I can plug in the end point and it gives me f of when I can plug in the end point what this says in general is okay the limits exist in all cases one-sidedly and in general and the limits equal the functions at every single value if that happens you're continuous the whole way through not just on the open interval but now on the closed interval because you included end points and that's how you check it did that make sense to you were you able to follow that it might seem a little confused why why did we do this well you kind of have to do it that way you have to check a one- side limit because you can't technically do this for the whole thing because you don't have um you don't have a limit at every single point a fullon limit from both sides at every point you have it here but you don't have it here that's the difference that's why you have to check the ends now a couple properties about limits that we're going to discuss were there any questions on that by the way as my back is turned to you so I can't see you raise your hand any questions seriously all right then a couple properties let's say that we got two functions f and g and both are continuous um at a certain point if f and g are continuous at a certain point point then all of the following statements are true firstly if f and g are both continuous f+ G must also be continuous F minus G must also be continuous f * G is continuous at that point at that specific point so s continuous and G is continuous at a certain point then we can do f plus g f minus G and F * G and they're all continuous at that exact same point does that make sense to you where it wouldn't be the case is let's say that F was continuous but g wasn't continuous at a certain point if you add them well then G's still not continuous there right no matter what you do so that wouldn't work the other one is well you probably we figured out but F over G now I'll say this F overg is continuous at C unless what happens G sure G of C actually G of c g of because we're talking about at the point C right if G of C equals zero if the if C uh when you when you take the limit uh of G and as you're approaching C if that goes to zero well then you're dividing by zero and you can't have that so it is continuous at C unless G of C equals z and then you'd have a problem if it does because we're going to see this in just a moment if G of C does equal zero what does that tell you about your your function firstly is it continuous secondly there are two oh I hope you I hope you remember this there were two cases when you divided by zero there was two cases of what you could have name one AO or ASM tote so if G ofc does equal zero there is a discontinuity at C there's discontinuity at C of course we're speaking just of this though okay F would be continuous and G would be continuous F over G there would be discontinuity at C for f over G for that U division of those two functions are you guys okay with that that all these are okay except for this one and if this is the case if G of C does equal zero then we have a discontinuity and that's either a whole or an asmt you remember that I'm going to actually Define that for you later and give you the the notes on that we've just kind of spoken about it I wanted to preview it so that way when you got here it's like oh yeah that's easy talk about that so it's going to be very easy in just a moment you're like yes I get this because we already talked about it but before I do that I do have to talk about one more thing it's going to be kind of interesting to you Scott so just a recap um it wasn't on this right no oh good CU this is if zero if it's zero over zero and it's an asmt no no we're going to talk about that right now okay well not right now we're going to talk about about that in uh three and a half minutes roughly not roughly exactly okay do you remember that if a function is continuous at any point C I hope you remember because we just talked about it if a function is continuous at C here's what we know the limit of the function as X approaches C equals not c c f of C yes does that look familiar to you that was the definition of of continuity right there it said this exists this exists and they equal each other remember that that was number three so this is our defition of continuity if we're continuous at any point C then that has to take place but I want to refresh your memory on something do you remember what could happen for a pol a polom when we first introduced limus I did this I I gave you the properties I work through a specific polom and I say hey can we do this for every polinomial like yeah that's awesome like yeah I know right and you're like yeah that's cool do you remember you remember let me even make it easier make it a c for any any point do you remember what you can do to find the limit of a polinomial does it involve a lot of work just plug it in you just plug it in which means in this case if I'm trying to find the limit of a polinomial so P of X is a poly nomial you just plug it in so what would the limit of a polinomial be as X approaches C what would it be the havec very good oops this is interesting I've just proved something for you in kind of a simple way it's kind of nice do you see that this looks a whole lot like that this was the definition of continuity right this we know we could do for any polinomial true what this says is that every polom is continuous everywhere this is always the case so we just prove that every polom is always continuous isn't that interesting every poal that means everything like uh 3x^2 - 2x + 4 guarantee it's it's continuous it's polinomial as long as it doesn't have square roots because that's not a polinomial negative exponents because that's not a polinomial uh fractional exponents because those are again those are Roots right it's not a polinomial as long just has those those positive exponents to it and there's no fractions it's continuous that's what a polinomial is this says that every polinomial is continuous that's kind of cool so what this says is any polom is continuous anywhere that's very cool big statement every polinomial is contous everywhere if we combine this idea with this idea check it out combine this idea every polinomial is continuous with this idea of this is always going to be continuous provided that g is not zero what that means is that every rational function will be continuous everywhere except where the denominator is equal to zero because a rational function is a polom over polinomial do you buy into that so it says pols are always continuous rational functions are always continuous unless the denominator equals zero that's what these two statements say together so a rational function which is like P of X over Q ofx where these are both pols is continuous everywhere except continues everywhere except where the denominator could be equal to zero in other words where this happens at that point you're going to have a discontinuity that's what we said right if the denominator is equal to zero you will have a discontinuity at that point what I've already told you is that that point will either be a whole or an ASM toote remember that that's the two things we could have so we we're starting to put everything together polins always continuous we just proved it with our limit rational functions always continuous except where this happens because we can know we know that we can take look at that two continuous functions if it's rational that means they're both continuous because it's a polinomial of a polinomial that satisfies that they're both continuous everywhere if you take it this will also be continuous unless the denominator is zero and that's all I'm saying here is except for the denominator equals zero at that point you will have a discontinuity either a ho or an AS asot for that's typically this is 95% of the time what happens holes and asmp tootes now we've we've seen a case where this didn't work okay we already saw that where we had Z over zero if you have Z over Z you can typically Factor well you will always be able to factor uh T well typically unless you're doing like trig function function but if you are dealing with rational okay let's just stick with rational for right now if you have this and it's rational you will be able to factor it you will be able to cross something out that will happen here if it's a rational function I'm not saying square roots I'm not saying uh weird exponents I'm saying polinomial over polinomial you understand the difference there that will happen now does it always take care of every problem no we already saw that that didn't but it's a good place to start if you have this and you cross it out that's typically a hole all right that's typically what happens if you cross it out and you still have this where you have a number over zero a number over zero that says you can't cross it out you're going to have an ASM toote there that's typically what happens here some expression over zero you with me on that one no you said c over Conant that would be the constant some constant oh just any okay some constant because when you evaluate the limit right you plug in a number for it yeah if you have a number over zero it's probably an ASM toote 95% okay every time I don't know 95% that's what happens would you like to try a couple examples yes I'll appr you MTH class have you understood everything we talk about so far think so examples tell us really lost or not I'm thinking probably not what we're going to do with this problem is I want to find any discontinuities tell me what you know about discontinuities with a rational function like this one tell me what you know about discontinuities where do they occurin when the what equals zero the numerator or denominator denominator equals zero so how are we going to find discontinuities for rational functions ex the bottom sure set equal Z that's going to involve some fact absolutely essentially all you're doing is finding domain remember finding domain what we had problems with domain we already really covered this when you cover domain you basically cover where your function is not continuous we're just doing it for real now talking about continuity so you've already basically done that if you set your denominator not equal to zero and solve it down you're going to find out those points that you cannot have so uh what however you choose to do that you need to find your discontinuity so if we set our denominator equal to zero what that's going to tell you is where you are not continuous at the points at which you are not continuous how about that it's better English better English can you factor that jeez I sure hope so really do did you get two and3 as well now I want you to go one step further I want you to identify whether those things are holes whether those things are ASM tootes and here's the way you can do that Factor both the numerator and denominator as much as you can right or plug in why don't you plug in the number uh plug in plug in one of those numbers and see what you get you can do it that way too but if you factor as much as you can what you're going to get is x + 2 x - 2 all over x + 3 x - 2 you with me on that one okay now you need to get both disc all the discontinuities first before you start Crossing stuff out are you ever going to be able to cross out a discontinuity and just eliminate the discontinuity we learned that from domain right you can't ever just cross out a domain issue and then say my domain's fine no you can't do that right you still have to write it down so first write down where you don't where your discontinuities are so discontinuities at x = 3 sorry3 and x = 2 this will tell you which is which that will tell you which is which uh which one can you cross out the two or the3 two if you can cross it out what does that tell you about the discontinuity at xal 2 that's a hole if you can cross it out that means the function goes like this and then it just it misses that one point and continues so this thing that's how you find it out if you crossed out the discontinuity you can't ever get rid of it but if you're able to factor it out that's a whole tell me something you're completely factored right can you cross out the x + 3 no at all so what does it tell you about the the discontinuity that occurs right there that's an ASM toote and that's how you determine it no it's not hard it's factoring and Crossing stuff out what you cross out it's called the whole what you don't cross out is called an ASM toote at least for rational functions that's the way it works I'm not going to give you another example because I think that's pretty straightforward is that pretty straightforward yeah awesome uh let's go ahead let's prove something here real quick let's prove that the absolute value of x is continuous everywhere now can you picture the absolute value of x in your head is it continuous everywhere do you ever pick your pencil up no then it's continuous everywhere that's what graphically it means let's figure out how to prove that it's going to be similar to um one of some of our one side limits we've already worked with is absolute value of x continuous everywhere and you go let's see looks like this yep done no we can't do that there's Pro why that'd be awesome here's a pro with some some limits okay what we want to prove for cond that was pretty funny I like that is that the the limit exists at every point that the limit equals the function value at every point and that even at that weird place where it comes together that that exists so here's how we're going to Define it all right we're going to define absolute value of x in in an interesting way we're going to say that absolute value of x you already know this one it's X and it's negative X in fact I think we could probably do that to but this will make it even more interesting for X is bigger than zero for X is less than zero let's make it zero for x equals z the reason why the reason why that this looks funny to you and why I don't have an equality here is because do you remember what we ran into with limits as far as checking the end points you remember we ran into Li there is no limit at an end point you have to check the end points themselves right so we would run into this situation anyway if I had an equal sign that would dictate an actual end point you follow me on that so what I'm saying is that that's basically an open interval we can check that with our knowledge of pols and and continuity no problem same thing with this one that we'll have to check with one-sided limits so here's what we know is this a polom yeah sure it's the most simple polom well besides a constant that's like the most simple polinomial you can have right just X are pols continuous everywhere then this is continuous everywhere it's a polom what that means is hey is this a polinomial sure that means it's continuous now this is that is well technically polinomial right that's that's just a one but it's one single point this is the point zero so when you get zero it gives you zero that's the where you come together on your your absolute value what we need to check is only this we need to check that the one-sided limit of this one equals z and the one side limit of this one equals zero that's what we can check if we can prove that then we know that that's continuous everywhere the limit of this equals z the limit of this equals z the function is defined at zero therefore all three pieces come together do you see what we're trying to do here if you don't then I need to know yes some people are just looking yes or no okay sometimes I say I get I get during the headlights yes I'm looking at you sometimes I wonder if I have a lazy eye and it's like I'm looking you're think is he look I had a teacher with a lazy eye once one my say it'd be like this like looking at you and then be like yeah yeah I get it and then she would switch it yeah that was crating she had fun with it though she really did she had fun with it good lady okay or man I'm not naming names I just had a teacher once whatever all right so uh let's go ahead and do this we're going to check this the limit as X approaches zero from the right look at look what we're doing X is positive right so from the right for X from the left forx and we'll see what each of these things are so from from the right hand side where does X go from the right hand side as you approach zero it goes to zero it's a polom you can plug it in it's going to zero where does Negative X go as you approach Zero from the left does it also go to zero goes a z that checks it right there it says that the limit the one side limit exists this limit clearly exists as continuous this limit is exists it says it's going to the point that is also defined that says the limits exist the point exists and they all equal each other that means that you're continuous everywhere and that's how you prove it okay we got to move on for a little bit what right now we're going to talk about is something to do with compositions and how we can use compositions up very much to our benefit in functions now stick with me here we're kind of pro stuff today if you haven't noticed let's say that there's a certain function that as X approaches some number we'll call it C the limit definitely exists and we'll call it l and let's also say there's another function f F and it's continuous at L well then check this out we're going to find out right now what happens when we compose G on to F or F of G and rul so what happens if we take the limit as X approaches C of f of G of x a composition you guys have seen compositions like that before yeah well this is kind of interesting just check check this out for a minute would you agree that if the limit exists if the limit exists then the limit of G of X as X approaches C is equal to the Limit yes but it's also equal to G of C right so then as we're plugging in C this is this is G of C but that's also equal to the limit so this equals so that's the same thing as F of L Reon I I had the extra limit in there I don't need that uh so if x approaches C then G of X approaches L you you with me on that want I had the extra limit I didn't need it uh if if G of X approaches L and F is continuous at L then we know if f is continuous we can just plug that number in this is going to be equal to F of L now the cool thing is we'll make a substitution right here and we'll say all right well then we can do F of how much is L equal to not just G of x g the limit of G of x as x c what that proves to you is you can separate limits by composition so this says look at that this is a composition of f of G ofx we can pull the F outside of the outside of limit we can take the limit of the G of X and then apply the function that's really interesting yeah F has to be continuous to L because when you compose that you're actually not plugging C into F you're pluging L into F does that make sense you're plugging C into G the the limit of G as X approach C gives you L you're taking that L you pluging into F since f is continuous at L you can make this jump to say if I plug in the C that's going to go to L if I plug in the L right here that's going to go to F of L because it's continuous you with me on that one since that happens we can make that jump and say oh but wait L is equal to the limit of G of X as X approaches C and that proves our composition for say we can separate limits by composition so this says right here we can separate limits by composition let me give you a quick example of how we can do this how we can use it talk about maybe one more thing for today so quick example let's say we have a limit as X approaches 4 of the absolute value 10 - 3x2 here's basically what this says we can do do you understand how this really is a composition of one function and the absolute value function do you guys see that what it says is that you can treat this because we don't we haven't really defined uh limits of absolute value we haven't really talked about that we've had to do one- side limits for things like this so far so if we haven't really talked about it there's something that we actually can do here this says well well wait if that's a composition then this means since we've proved absolute value of x is this is why we had to do it why you're like why didn't we use it here we've already proved absolute value of x is continuous everywhere you with me and for this function to work for this for this uh composition work F had to be continuous at every at a point well it's continuous at all points therefore we can do the composition do you see the difference there we couldn't use it here because that would be circular but we had to prove it once we proved it now we can use it for absolute value say oh well well wait that's a composition of a function that's continuous everywhere I can pull that outside if you remember uh I hope you do you remember you remember remember well I actually did that with cosine before remember me doing that with cosine the reason why we could do it is because cosine is continuous everywhere and now I've proved it for compositions we used it earlier but I've proved it now that we can in fact do that so we say take the limit of this and then take the absolute value and that will work just fine for you you can separate limits by composition what's the limit of 10 - 3x^2 as we approach 4 don't all speak at once 38 38 no 38 38 wait inside so this says you'll have the absolute value of - 38 because the limit of 10 - 3x^2 it's polinomial you plug in the number you get -38 then we take the absolute value of -38 we get and that's our answer so limit would be 38 a couple notes before we go um if two functions are continuous everywhere their composition will be continuous everywhere so absolute value be considered two functions absolute value with any anything inside it can be considered a composition two functions are continuous everywhere their composition is continuous everywhere it's for this reason if this always works if it's always continuous and that's always continuous and you can close them any anywh you want it's still going to be continuous one last thing about inverses we haven't spoken about them yet we will just briefly if f is continuous on its domain then F inverse will be continuous on its domain but remember that with inverses the domain of an inverse is the range of your original function so if f is continuous on its domain F inverse the inverse of f will also be continuous on its respective domain but keep in mind that the domain of f inverse is the range of your original function you switch X and Y right so the range becomes domain domain becomes range so if f is continuous on its domain F inverse will also be continuous on its respective domain but that is the range of your original function the range of f okay in the last minute that we have let me give you one quick example let's just say F ofx is X cubed uh is X cubed a polinomial that means it's continuous everywhere so it's continuous on the entire ire domain entire real number system so it's a polom it's continuous on negative Infinity to Infinity it's R what's its range what's its range z Oh not just that all real it also goes from negative Infinity to Infinity yeah all real numbers so if we found the inverse do you remember how to find the inverse yeah you well you make y = x Cub you switch your variables X = Y Cub you solve for your y the cubot of x = y and therefore F inverse of X = the cube root of x here's Cube here's what I know about this already I I don't I I know that for a fact because this is the inverse of this polinomial I don't have to do any more work with it I guarantee you that that's continuous on the range of my original function so because the range of my function was negative Infinity to Infinity not the domain not really concerned about that that's a polom everywhere but my range is netive infinity to Infinity what this says is that this must be continuous from negative Infinity to Infinity continuous everywhere if the range is everything the inverse function has a domain of everything so it's continuous because of the range negative Infinity to Infinity well good afternoon welcome back we're going to continue talking just a little bit about some limits uh one application of of these of well and continuity one application of continuity we're going to talk about today is something called the intermediate value theorem now here's the idea let's say that I gave you some continuous function so so it's it's definitely a function f ofx and I say this function is defined between a and b or let's just put some end points on it A to B can you tell me how high is this point it would be certainly y but let's not make it in terms of Y let's make it in terms of f how high would that point be F of a is a good St well that that that'd be what how high it would be so if this is a how how you figure the height out is you plug that into your function right in other words F of a cool how high is this point F all right let's follow the pattern there so F of a f of B very good that's our gives us our Heights now here's the question firstly let me say that f is certainly continuous do you see that f is continuous on the interval AB so f ofx is continuous in fact since it has those end points we can say it's continuous on the Clos interval as well here's my question let's suppose that I picked some random Point some arbitrary point between F of a some arbitrary value between F of a and F of B let maybe like here and I'll call it K so let's say that K is between F of a and F of B here's my question if I find the the input that gives me this output if I can find the input that gives me that output will it be between A and B that's the question if f is continuous here's what it says it says if you give me any point any value between F of a and F of B something in here I can guarantee you that the input that would give me that value lies between a and b and here's how we say this is the inter intermediate value theorem it says uh for any value k for any value K there's at least one point at least one value between A and B that will give you that the function of that value gives you K so in other words um if K is between F of a and F of B then there's at least one x value at least there could be more if you if you don't have a one to one function you could have several there's at least one number let me call it C okay at least one number we'll call it C such that F of C will give you k oh you know what I need to add one little part here uh there's at least one number c where C is between that's kind of a key point where C is between a and b and F of Cal K you want to hear it in plain English because that's kind of mathy right says well say K's between F of a and F of B then there's at least one number c where she is between a and b and F of C equals K now that makes perfect sense to me but here's what it says in English for you if you're like okay I don't understand this here's what it says if you give me any if your if your function's continuous that means there's no holes there's no asmt there's no jumps you get you get me it's a smooth curve uh if if your if you give me an output between these numbers my input will be between these numbers so here's my input and my output right for those those respective values here's my input and my output says you give me an output anywhere in this range the input must be somewhere between this range and there's going to be at least one such that this input gives you that output could you pick a different point sure you can pick any one of these points but no matter what that output is going to be mapped to at least one input at least one now if you did a curve like this where you where you had that you could have more than one right one two three however many you wanted uh you could definitely do that if it's continuous it'll have at least one though how people understand theidea of that and that's called the intermediate value theorem do you want to see kind of a cool application for this sure I'm excited about it hope you're excited about it you want to see good here's a cool appro uh application you can actually approximate Roots you know what roots are right where functions cross the x-axis you can approximate that with this idea here's the the plan let's say that I have this this certain function um it looks like that though well of course this height is f of B and that Heights F of a here's the idea using the intermediate value theorem you know for a fact for a fact that this was true right if I give you some specific value here you can find me an input in this range such that that gives me that output are you with me on that you can give me any specific output that you want to and I can find you the input that's in this range you understand that here's what it says for this it says let's suppose that you know that F of a is positive and F of B is negative so in other words the signs are different if the signs are different then what you know for sure is that it crosses the x-axis right in other words it says that if I say find me the point of zero that's an intermediate value right there right it's between those values if say find me the the input that gives me zero we we need to or we know for sure that that actually exists if our signs are different then of course we cross the x- axis right and according to the intermediate value theorem it says well you're continuous right your signs are are different so if we're going from positive to negative according to our our interval of outputs then Zero's got to be between those because we went for positive to negative so I can I can say with certainty according to the intermediate value theorem that there is going to be an input such that F of that input will give me an output of zero let let me write some of that out for you so that you have that it says that if your signs are different F of a and F of B have different signs if you ever thought about two things having different signs then you know zero will be between those two numbers true I say uh negative anything and positive anything you know that zero is between them yes if zero is between them that means you you can apply the intermediate value the if zero is between them then you must have a certain input that will give you zero that's applied uh using inter intermediate value theorem applied to this case so so says if the signs are different there must be at least one root on that closed interval that's all this says then that's all that says it just a very specific case where your signs are different you know zeros between them you can say for any output you can give me a specific input on that on that uh domain on that interval would you like to see it in in application how you would actually do this now of course we have calculators right you just go oh let me use my zero button for my graphing and it will do it very very fast well let's say that all calculators broke isn't that interesting idea what if they all broke which they're not going to but if they did you could you could now do it here's the example I'll give you this function I'll just explain very quickly uh the idea you'd find some some point on this graph I know for for sure that I don't really know exactly how this graph looks but I know for sure it's continuous everywhere can you explain expl to me why this is continuous everywhere very good so this is definitely going to be continuous on any closed interval so I know this graph looks something like that all right I know for sure it goes forever well here's the deal I'd plug in some numbers at some point and what I would find is that when I plugged in one and when I plugged in two they had different signs for instance F of two was up here F of one was down here that means that somewhere between 1 and two according to the intermediate value theorem as used for approximating roots I know that I'm going to have some number that gives me a zero there does that make sense to you I know it's going to be within that range because well my signs are different so here's how you go about doing that you'd make yourself up a table XY and what you'd do is You' have every every value between 1 and two according to like a tenth or something so like 1.1 1.0 and 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 and so on and what this is very timec consuming okay you're not going to do this all the time you're going to use your your calculator of course but this is how you would do it I'm just giving you the how am I expecting you to do this all the time no heck no but this is how it would work according to our our theorem over here what you do is You' take all these numbers and you would plug them into that function you're going to get a negative a negative a negative but somewhere it's going to change to a positive are you with me it's saying like here it's negative here's negative here but somewhere somewhere over here it's going to change to a positive and I think if I've done this right it's between 1.3 and 1.4 so this would be negative negative negative negative positive positive positive right here well you've just narrowed the range right now you know that the root has to be between 1 .3 and 1.4 do you see why we use the same idea we just can't made smaller so you take that and you go okay let's try this again XY and youd start now with 1.30 1.31 1.32 and you'd continue that and then you'd find out which one of those is negative and and where the breakoff is to where it becomes positive do you see how you can get very accurate with this you can get to however many decimal places you want already I know it's going to be 1.3 something and then I would do this one I find out it's 1.3 something I could find out all those numbers as much as I want as accurate as I want to be and that's one way you can actually set up computer program to do that for you program a calculator that would that would do that for you might take a little bit of time but it's possible how many people understood the idea of of applying that all right good deal so just a little kind of nice something we can use there 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 1.5:  Slope of a Curve, Velocity, and Rates of Change
now are you ready to learn how we can take limits and use them first I've already kind of shown you a basic idea of how to do this how to find this the slope of a curve at a point would you like to learn how to do it for real using limits are you sure the answer is yes otherwise you get to leave the class because this is where Calculus is going now so would you like to learn it yeah otherwise you're not going to learn calculus you're going to learn well just basic algebra and limits that's all we've done so far ready to learn calculus should jumpy you can watch that again on YouTube maybe you don't want to it's too scary you never seen a grown man get excited about calculus before come on people that's well first time for everything 1.5 we're going to talk about tangent lines we're going to apply them to rates of change and you're going to see that we can take our idea of limits and turn it into a tangent line and turn it into a rate of change it's going to be kind of an interesting idea I I need you to follow through this is like a kind of a not really a proof it's kind of a semi- proof we're going to be creating creating the slope of a curve at a point I I'll give you a definition for how we say the slope of a curve at a point in the next section for right now this is what we're doing though the first part of calculus what we want to do is find the tangent to a curve right in order find a tangent of a curve you need a slope and a point the point's going to be given what we want to be able to do is find the slope of a curve at a point that's our whole idea so that's why we'll be talking about tangent lines and then rates of change follows directly from that so we're going to use limits to find the slope of a tangent line to a curve at a point I'm going to actually write that down so you understand what we're doing again in calculus a lot of people get halfway through and they forget what it is they're actually doing they just get caught up in the formulas and doing the math and they're not really focusing on what you're doing what we're doing anytime we do this process we're finding the slope of a curve at a point or the slope of a tangent line to a curve at a point so we're using limits to find the slope of a tangent line to a curve at a point let me say of the tangent line that folks is the first idea the first problem in calculus we're going to create it from scratch so I I want you to understand where this is coming from some of you will have seen part of this formula before in your um pre-calculus class some of you might have seen it in your intermediate algebra class it's going to look familiar wait a second that's why we did that because at the time you're like what the what the heck is this why are we using you're going to see why you're using that so we're going to invent this formula together that way you see where it's coming from would you like to do that yeah brother I just give it I hated that I want you to see where it's coming from and understand it part of math isn't just doing the math it's understanding it that way you have a better understanding later on so here here's our creation our idea again I'm going to draw my same curve I did before we want to find the slope of this curve at some point and I'm going to call it P again what was the other point that I used q q yeah now our idea was that we're going to take q and have it really really close to P right right that was the idea of a limit really really close without touching it that's the idea here now what we're going to do is Define this a little bit differently than I did before you see we are going to find the slope of the secant line that's the line that connects those two points but here's how I'd like to do it the first thing I want to do is say Okay p is some point let's call it x sub Z just my my point and it's fixed it's my actual solid point x sub zero you okay with this so far let's see is that straighter or less straight is that horrible is that that's better it looks am I wearing different Siz shoes or something like this that's horrible okay X Sub 0 and this point over how far is that how far is that well you can't say oh is seven well there's no actual value right we're doing this in general we don't want to use a different variable we want it based on this one but here's how I'm going to do it I want to say okay this this is x sub Z plus a little teeny bit are you with me on that plus a little teeny bit here's why I want to do the plus a little teeny bit uh because I want to introduce the limits to you right now because if if I do plus a little teeny bit and I take that little teeny bit and I let it go to zero think about this for a second if I let the little teeny bit go to zero that squeezes Point Q all the way over to point P do you see it if I let it approach zero so here's how we're going to Define it we're not going to call it anything else we're going to say this is x sub 0 plus a little bit and H is that little bit now keep in mind this is not to scale okay what we actually are doing is p and Q are so are going to become so close to each other that it's no difference okay are you ready to find out this the height let's figure out those two points how high is point P can you tell me that f p yeah let's assume this function is f then that would be F of what now no not P not p f Sub Zero because that's our x coordinate for p so far so good how about the the top point R CU sure we know to find out the height of our function we just plug in our x coordinates how that's how functions work so we now have this thing what we want to do remember our idea is this never forget the idea we want to find the slope of the tangent line to a a curve at a point our point is point P right now are you with me on that we want to find the slope of this curve at Point P basically is what we're doing so this is our Point what we're going to do with that though is well we need how many points to make a line how many points to find the slope you don't have to whisper it how many two two yes you're all right you need two yeah you need two points say proudly two points yeah you need two so we have these two points but our idea is let's just take Point q and put it a little bit past Point P you follow me on that because ultimately we're going to take this distance and make it zero or make it approach zero not equal zero because then we would have two points anymore we're going to make it approach zero that means get really really close and that's the idea of a limit do you see why we had to have limits before we could do this idea okay well let's go keep going let's find some slope out why don't you tell me what is slope oh very good okay rise over but give me another way you would do it very good okay change in you have it backwards but change in there you go the change in y over the change in X let's find out the change in y and the change in X can you tell me our change in y goes from point P to point Q how far is that or in other words how could I figure it out okay let me give you some okay hang on this is 10 this is three how far is it between them very good how'd you do it subtracted 3 - 10 or 10 - 3 hopefully 10 - 3 the big oneus the small one right so how we do this is we go okay well this is not not 10us 3 it is do it again for me very good this value and you could use parentheses if you want but it's not it's not necessary here x Sub 0 plus h- X Sub 0 will give you the distance between it this is all of X Sub 0 plus h minus X Sub 0 will give you the distance between those two x values now if you're still okay with that it's kind of a big one okay do the math what's this going to be H that is H that's just H well that should make sense I mean how far apart is x sub Z from x sub Z Plus H it's just H right it's just a little bit if H was two it would be two apart if H is 01 well then they're 01 apart it's just H just H now let's go ahead let's also find the rise how much is the rise F of h no not F of H not F of H if this was 10 and this was three the distance between them would be seven true now how did you do that subtract it so subtract it you know I'm going to do this over here so you can see it a little bit better this is f of x Sub 0 plus h right this is f of x Sub 0 so write that out don't do the math in your head just because you're making a mistake on that right now some of you I want you to write out exactly what it is write out exactly what I want you to do what is it f of x Sub 0 plus h that's the first value what what am I subtracting from that but show hands how many people feel okay I'm getting not only the H but now getting this rise feel all right with that yes no okay now where where did people go wrong and give me f of H can you subtract x sub 0us X Sub 0 answer is no you can't do that that's impossible you cannot combine those two things so this this is the function at this point this is the function at this point those are two distinct points right you can't subtract them and give me the function at the the difference between them that's completely the wrong wrong way to go right this would be the height at x sub that's that one this is the height of X Sub 0 plus h that's that's that one if you find F of h f of H is like way down here right H is just a little bitty point a little bitty sorry uh yeah F of H H is right here that's going to be very different than anything between those anything having to do with that you can't just subtract a function minus a function and subtract the the input values like that you can't do that okay so there's no way we can actually simplify that part of it do you agree nothing we can do with that however can you come up with the formula for a slope right now so we have slope is rise over run Delta y over Delta x what is our Delta Y in this case Zero yeah it's hard to say isn't it f of x that's why you get a master's degree you can say all this they teach you that's not what they teach you now f of x Sub 0 plus h sure minus f of x plus f of x Sub 0 so this right here is our Delta y this right here is our Delta X so right now we actually have the formula for slope but I need you to understand where that comes from are you okay where that this is in fact the rise and this is in fact the Run are you okay with that do you see where it's where it's coming from on on your graph does that look familiar have you ever heard of the difference quotient before that's the difference quotient you might have had that in your pre-calculus I'm sure you had that in your pre-calculus class they did a lot of work with that right why because we're now going to extrapolate from that and gets the slope of a curve at a point cool now here's the deal what we've done right now is we have the slope sure but is it the slope of a tangent or the slope of a secant okay secant yes see we have the slope between these two actual fixed points right now yes what what we want to do is just what we did like the first couple days of of this calculus course not the review but the calculus part of this we want let Point Q get really close to point p and I've said it before in here but how are we going to do that we can't change x sub Z that's fixed okay what are we going to do to let this get close to that what happens does H get bigger does H get smaller how much smaller infinitely smaller so infinitely close to in other words that means let H approach zero so what we're going to do is we're we're going to make so this is a seant right now in order to get the tangent we're going to make Point Q get close to point P make Q get really close to point B Point P how you might ask well we're going to take that H we're going to make it close to zero that says the distance between them is very very very small well tell me something I can't just say oh yeah I'm going to make H zero I have to introduce something that we've had in this class before what allows you to take a value a variable and move it close to a number what was that it's called the limit so here's how we make the jump from a secant which is what this is that's just the slope of you could do this with any line it's going to find the slope for any point that's what it is if you know the distance points that's what that is saying okay that is the slope formula it's just a different way to write it how we make the the jump from this secant to the tangent that I'm going to write over here is is we're going to let H approach zero that involves the limit that's why we had to have limits so this one's the secant we want the slope of the tangent line the slope of the tangent line is going to look almost identical it's going to have the f of x Sub 0 plus h minus of x0 all over H only now what do we want the H to do so we need a limit as I could have just given you that right and said that's slope of tangent line but do you see what's happening here do you see how this this is the slope of any two points that that I want okay this is the slope and this is the distance between those two points and what this says is I'm making that distance get really close to zero can it ever equals zero No in fact if you plug in zero what happens you get something undefined why why does that happen it says well if you only have one point I.E you let it go to zero and get there you only have one point right can you find the slope of one point that doesn't make any sense so you can't let it get to zero that's why we had to use the limit and say we're approaching zero where the the distance between those numbers doesn't make that much of a significant difference but there is a small small difference that's all we had to have that limit idea would you like to see an example about how to actually use this for sure I would hope so it's kind of interesting right we just kind of proved that you can find a slope of a curve at a point isn't that that's kind of neat I know we've done it one time before but it took a whole lot of work now we're going to minimize our work I hope so let's try this we've done this example we did it the long way now we're going to have a nice easier way to do this so find the equation I'm sorry of the tangent line to Y = X2 at the point right now I'm going to give you an actual point that's how I've defined our function x sub Z is the actual value it's a fixed point of X okay it says you have an x value of this number in the future I'm not going to give you that we're gonna be able to find the slope at any point and that's even more cool even more cooler at one one but the first thing we got to do we got to figure out what all this stuff is and where you start is you got to Define your function so in our case what is f ofx what are we going to treat as F ofx good that's important for you to know that because we're going to be referring back to x squ a lot right now also you need to identify what is x sub Z for this specific case in our case what is the x coordinate that's our X of the fixed point one so X Sub 0 in our case is one says you're starting at the0 one are you guys all right with that not because this is the one that would be the output that would be f of x of0 or that that that's what we get when we plug in one but the X Sub 0 is one that's the x coordinate have our fixed point you okay with this so far now I'm going to encourage you to do a couple things before you just blindly plug the stuff in I want you to find the f of x Sub 0 plus h and the f of x Sub 0 independently so in our case we want to find f of x Sub 0 + H tell me what was X Sub 0 again so we want to find X Sub 0 Plus plus h but X Sub 0 is 1 I want to find F of what 1 plus h make the jump from X Sub 0 to what your your value actually is for X Sub 0 did you follow that one so this is 1 + H give you a head on if you see where the one is coming from good all right also we want f of x Sub 0 f of x Sub 0 is really F of what very good so short little recap we identify our function we identify the point those two things are there this right here is your formula to find the slope of a tangent line that's it all you've got to be able to do H is not going to change you just need to find this thing and this thing accurately plug it in and find your limit this is going to incorporate a lot of things we've done in this class already so f of x Sub 0 plus h that is f of 1 + h f of x Sub 0 that is f of 1 because X Sub 0 is 1 you with me let's start on the easy part what's F of one say to do one yeah plug in one where are we going to plug in one yeah so plug in one how much is that going to give you 1 s is one sure in fact it should give it to you right here right cuz that is the output I mean should give it to you if it gives you the whole point that's even easier if it says as at x equals a number well then yes you actually have to plug it in on your own now how about F of 1 + H what do you do with that turn into a pol turn it into what do you mean plug it into F you know what this meant this meant plug in one right you know what this means plug in one plus h I always told my students I said look at this thing is non-separable you can't do this what please watch on the board common mistake all the time when you first learn this especially compositions if you struggle with that people go okay this is f okay I want F ofx I want to do 1 plus h so they'll give me this uh let's do 1^ 2 + H CU that's F of 1 plus h do you see the mistake this isn't one F of one plus h that'd be written like this that's what that would be that is that okay this isn't F of one plus h it's F of 1 plus h okay you can't separate it it's like one thing for you right whatever I have in there that's what you're plugging in you don't do F of one plus h you do F of 1 plus h like it's one word do you get it you cannot separate it so in our case we're not doing 1 plus h no no no no no no we're doing F of 1 plus h so what's that going to be 1 H 1 + h s do you see how to get from here to here are you sure not F of one plus oh please please don't do that it's never going to work for you if you do that never oh my gosh that would be horrible well now all we've got to do is take these quantities that you just figured out substitute them into my formula for my slope of the tangent line and we'll be done more or less that more or less it's scary yeah no it's it's less it's stuff you've already done very easy so instead of x sub z f of x0 plus h I've already figured that out that was 1 + h^2 that's what I'm going to put first minus instead of f of x Sub 0 what did I work that out to you that's what I have you do off the side right you just break it down piece by piece that's okay F of 1 + H was 1 + h 2 F of 1 is 1 all over how much oh don't forget that H don't forget that H okay and now here's where you try to plug in the number because this is a limit now right this is just a limit which we've already conquered those sections you plug in zero can you plug in zero you get oh 0 over zero right that's a problem don't you or you something over zero looks like 0 over Z to me so oh we need to do something else then why don't we figure out what this is so let's go ahead distribute that combine some like terms and see what happens don't forget to write the limit let's see that's 1 + 2 H + h^ 2 - 1 over H did you get the same thing when you distributed as well what happens here the ones the ones are gone okay I like that that's great so that is the limit as H goes to zero of 2 H + h^2 over H oh man if I plug in zero right now it's still going to 0 over z uh what's another thing that I might be able to do do you remember when we whenever we had a 0 over Z typically what you do is you factor right and that sometimes most of the time will work your problem out for you that's what we're doing here now is it a problem for our domain that we'll be Crossing out a zero over zero no are we actually letting H get to zero just approach zero so that's fine we can do that and this is your process for find the slope of ctive Point what you ultimately want to do you want to cross out this INE that's your that's pretty much your goal that's it as soon as you get rid of that you'll be fine plug in the number so here we have h 2 + H over H are you okay on the factorization can we cross our H's out notice how we don't need to get rid of all our hes right just the one that's causing us the problem just that one notice how I'm still writing the limit anytime you have an H you're going to write the limit now am I okay to evaluate this limit as H goes to zero now we're fine we have no issues now you stop writing the limit you write 2 + 0 2 plus 0 is of course two two okay that's kind of cool what's the slope of that curve at the 0.11 two you just found it you found the slope of that curve at that point and now it made a whole lot more sense because we got to use limits with it so the slope of that tangent line is two can you find the equation to the line what do you need to find the equation for the line you need two things always to find the equation of a line point of slope do we have a point what's the point okay do we have a slope we do now because we just use limits to find one that's kind of neat and we'd use the slope now the point slope formula y - y1 m x - X1 why don't you plug that in there and see what you get okay you can all do that what you just found on your paper if you did that by yourself what you just found on your paper is a slope of a tangent line to the curve X2 at a point that's the only tangent line that's going to exist at that point now here's my question is the tangent line going to be different for a different point for instance if I give you the point 2 comma 4 are you going to have a different slope it's a it's a it's a parabola right yeah it has a different slope at every single point every Point has a different slope so yeah it's going to be different you going have to redo this every single time ultimately I'm going to find I'm going to give you a way so that you can find the equation for a for the slope of a tangent line that's going to be a little bit better so we'll do that at the end I just want to get you this picture in your head cuz I've actually given you this example before do you remember it I did that example for you I did it a long way though it was it was a ways back but now we have a better way using limits and we didn't have to make that jump we didn't have to make the limit jump because now we Define limits we can actually use that let's go ahead and start one more I want to get the first couple pieces of this down and then we will uh we'll continue next time so next up isn't that neat though you found the slope of a curve at a point I think that's so cool that's why I love this class to do some neat stuff let's find the equation of the tangent line to this curve at the point let's see uh 31 I want to make sure the idea sticks in your head so firstly what are we doing what's the what are we what are you trying to find SL slope of the tangent line to this curve at that specific point so we are going to be using that formula again what I want you to do see if you can find the two pieces that I need first how about f of x Sub 0 plus h in this case can you tell me what is x sub 0 please is it the three or the one it's a three it's the x value so x sub Z is three so instead of X Sub 0 plus h we're going to be finding F of what plus h 3 plus h so 3 plus h right it's it's one thing find F of 3 + H so I want that I know that sorry I'll write up here x of 0 = 3 FX = 3x that's always our first step find X Sub 0 and find your F ofx but now what I'd like you to do in the last few seconds here find F of 3 + H find F of 3 that will take care of your X Sub 0 + H and your F ofx Sub 0 did you already find that as I was talking firstly are you okay that x sub Z is in fact three yes or no are you okay okay that f ofx is 3x so we have we have those two things set in stone if you want to find this do the easy one first F of 3 that just means plug in three you should get that value again if it gives you a point because that is the output for that number so we should get 3 over3 or simply one did you all get one okay that's the easy one now the other one F of 3 + H is it going to be 3 over well what is it going to be are you going have have the H at the end or within the function it's it's 3 plus h right non-separable so this is 3 over what that's exactly right how many people have exactly that good for you okay I'll show you what to do with that next time we'll actually find the slope of that curve at that point all right so let's continue this problem we're talking about how to find tangents to Curves at certain points which in in of itself is a very interesting question specifically here we're trying to find the tangent line to this curve at that specific point and I've walked you through this already what we're trying to do is fill out the difference quotient which you guys are familiar with and then take a limit as H approaches zero in other words letting one point get really really really really close to this point therefore we have a tangent line to that curve at that point so we're almost there we have we have our F of 3 plus h we have our F of three and we're trying to find out as H approaches Z what this thing is going to be that's what we dealt with last time you remember inventing that last time I hope yes okay so we already have this part we already have this part let's make our substitution and then let's see what we can do with it so if we have this we'll have our our limit as H approaches zero notice you have to keep writing your limit until your limit is gone that's a must of instead of f of 3 + H please tell me quickly what am I going to have instead of f of 3 + H okay are you okay on the 3 over 3 + H yes now you see where that's coming from so instead of f of 3 + H I have well what that equals 3 over 3 + H then am I going to have a plus or minus what do you think yeah the formula says minus minus how much yeah F of three is one all over what folks don't forget that H so we've just made a little substitution we've have 3 over 3 + H for our F of 3 + H cool minus minus F of 3 well that is our one so here's our limit as H goes to zero raise your hand feel all right with that so far good all right now quick question can I cross out the three you know I see a lot of people love to do that right you go fast like oh the threes are the same I get to cross them out yay no not so much we can't cross them out because that's a term right that's not a factor we cannot simplify that in any way shape or form so how in the world are we supposed to get this H crossed out that's our ultimate goal because right now if we plug in h we're going to get Z over zero do you see it that's going to happen all the time if you let H go to zero because what this is is the slope between two points if you let H go to zero well you only have one point if you let it equal zero we're letting it approach zero so we are going to have two points but we need to find a way to manipulate this so we can cross out our H's so we don't have an issue with this any ideas denominator what now common denominator common denominator would be great because right now I have a complex fraction I have a fraction over well a fraction I need to make it one fraction over one fraction that way I can I can still work with it so so what's our LCD our common denominator going to be yeah when you only have one denominator it's that so instead of one notice you're still writing limit I have 3 over 3 + H minus instead of having one would you be okay if I put 3 + H over 3 + H is that the same thing sure yeah may as well one becomes that that is still one I'm just writing a special so I have a common denominator well if we continue well let's see what happens we've got a limit still H is still going to zero on the numerator oh let's check it out on the main numerator I know that I have a common denominator of 3 + H notice when you add or subtract fractions you do not change the denominator on the numerator what am I going to have Oh wrong say it again why is that minus important it's not really important right right or yes yes no it's not like we're talking about slope or anything right oh wait huh that's exactly what we're talking about so if you have your sign wrong your line goes from this to this or this to this is that big difference big difference freaking huge difference right you can't do that so get your signs right what's actually happening here is you have a parentheses around that that's what happens with any rational expression and this says you have 3 - 3 minus h- H yes no okay all over h that minus is important so we'll have a limit it's still a limit H is going to zero we have H over 3 + H all over H okay what now what do you want to do now okay do we have complex fraction sure we have one fraction over one fraction change that maybe into a fraction make it h over one you can do that right then what you'll see is I have one fraction divided by another fraction how you divide fractions is you reciprocate the second fraction and multiply do you see it you have one fraction divided by one fraction you reciprocate and then multiply so that'll be h/ 3 + H time I'm going to do this all at one step I'm going to reciprocate and multiply Time 1 over H times 1 over H are you okay on where the one over H is coming from are you sure so I'm reciprocating and multiplying what happens here yeah I don't want to distribute that H right because right now we have parentheses you were taught in your whatever class you learn this extend that line cross out those H's if you can because they're they're now factors what do I get on the numerator that negative oh that's important negative 1 so this is the limit this is the last time we'll write the limit for this problem -1 over 3 + H what duration if you can make it down that far you okay with this good deal that's great now wait a minute H is on the denominator can I plug in zero and be okay yes yes because I'm adding three to it that's fine if I evaluate this is where you stop writing the limit you say okay well this what this does this equals -1 over 3 + H oh sorry 3 + 0 because now we can let H go to zero now that we've eliminated that problem that's all right we can now evaluate that limit we know it's going to be continuous there's no problems there's no holes or ASM tootes at this point uh what's our answer what would you have gotten if you had forgotten to do this negative here positive 1/3 your is your tangent line going to be correct no no you would have the in inappropriate tangent line okay well that's all well and good are we done now this is kind of cool though what have you found what is this thing here always have that in your mind what you're doing you're finding slope this is the slope this is a slope of that curve this is a slope of that curve at that specific point do you follow me well that's convenient it's not coincidental but it's convenient because now we have the slope of this curve at that point we now have a point and the slope right what do you need to make the equation of a line point slope so we have that now I even gave you nice numbers what a nice guy I am look at that that's pretty cool are you okay on where the one the three and thetive 1/3 are coming from we're taking the point that that I've given you we're taking the slope that you have found and we're now making the equation of line that goes through that point with that slope not your if you're out with that one okay so we have our our min-1 that's -1 we have our 1/3 that's your slope we have our minus 3 that's the three if we distribute we'll get -3x and then what plus plus one very good we're almost done if we add one to it y = 13x + 2 very cool idea this line will intersect that curve at one spot and it's going to do it at that point so that is a tangent line to that curve at that point it's kind of a cool thing if you want to just talk about the slope of that curve at that point well that's the slope of the curve at the point if you want to graph a line that's the line it's kind of neat how many people feel okay with this so far now the next question is uh if I change points does my slope change does my equation change yeah they're all going to be different well that's going to be annoying because if I ask the next question okay find the line to the point uh let's see 9 1/3 then I ask how about uh 2 3 half then I ask some more you'd have to do this over and over and over and over again to find it for any point right maybe we can be a little bit smarter and do it once and for all perhaps we could find the equation for the slope and then just plug in the X values would you like to see a way to do that so in other words maybe I don't want to deal with a specific point I want to say I want to find the slope of this this function at any point that's I'm going to show you how to do now so let's find the slope of the tangent lines got my l find the slope of the tangent lines that just means the slope of the curve to Y = otk X at any point at any point well let's go through it you know that ultimately what we want to do is fill out this equation we know that slope equals the limit as H goes to zero f of x x Sub 0 plus hus f of x Sub 0 all over H you with me now X Sub 0 stands for a specific point does it not if we erase that F ofx Sub 0 we're going to find it for any point any point x you can use x sub Z if you want to I think the book uses that as well but you don't you don't necessarily have to be in general for any general point so well let's see can you tell me then let's let's figure these things out just like we did before can you figure out what f ofx is and what f of x plus h is let's try to let's try to fill this out then we'll make a small substitution to there just like we did right here and then we should be able to solve this thing out provided we can eliminate the H let's try that together so everyone let's look up here at the board uh what is our F ofx what's that do for us so what was it of X very good yeah that's because it says y = x that is our function so F ofx is X so far so good now how about f of x + h f ofx plus h is it f ofx + H like that is it f ofx plus H or is it f of x plus h so what that says to you is X Plus H you cannot separate right now what I've done is I've separated the X and the H do you see that this is not the square root this is not F ofx + h this is FX plus h how do I find let's compare it so this is wrong leave it on your paper just scratch that out that is not the correct thing what is the correct thing if I want to input all of X Plus H into my variable F ofx this is a composition folks you got to know how to do compositions that's why we spent some time on it earlier it's notun of X Plus H it's what x not just X Plus H [Music] that it's the square root sure and it says take this whole thing put it into the variable take the whole thing put it into the variable it's sare root of x + H notice the slight difference it doesn't look that different right but the square root stops here and it doesn't stop there this is the square root of x plus h how many people see the difference there and feel okay with it is it important to have that difference yeah it really is okay are we ready can we make the transition yeah we got we got everything we need we have f of x plus h got it we have f of x got it h doesn't change on your own why don't you plug that in make the substitution see what you get I'll do it on the board at the same time I always like to put this little tail on my square roots to show me where my square root stops that way I I know it's after the H I don't see I would hate for you to keep doing your steps right and this happens first step Second Step third step fourth oh now all of a sudden it's gone right that would suck or it get longer and longer and longer and it's covering the whole thing don't do that just make sure you know where your square root starts stops and and what it includes so f of x plus h great then we have a minus sign and we have FX F ofx was square root of x all over H you got that on your paper all right good deal now oh my gosh how do we solve it just give up let's just go home pointless anyway right now if you plug in zero you're going to get Z over zero you see it z z that's a problem so your whole goal here is to get rid of the H here that's your goal now there's of course ways to do it in fact I've shown you a problem quite simil to this with involving those square roots do you remember theate do you remember what the conjugate is whenever you have uh square roots like being subtracted or if square roots in any case you're taking a limit one great idea change the sign yeah change the sign multipli by the conjugate that's always a good idea to do do that right now multiply wait is it just the numerator or both the numerator and denominator both multiply it by the conjugate right now okay you're going to need to distribute the numerator but do not distribute the denominator you're trying to get rid of the H on the denominator if you distribute it you'll have to refactor it anyway hey does this sign change I know this one does does this sign change as well no no no okay good remember we have parenthesis here which means you're going to have to distribute and we have parenthesis here but what I told you is you don't want to distribute where you're trying to get rid of something right you're trying to get rid of that H so don't distribute that otherwise you'll have to refactor it so in our case our limit keep writing limit is denominator again keep it the same you'll see why in just a second but if you distribute the numerator correctly hopefully you got this no more Roots do you have any Roots then you probably did right numerator you're going to get X Plus H because the square root time itself gives you the radican that's the inside so we have our x + H that's great our middle terms are gone you're going to get plus rootx rootx plus h minus rootx rootx plus h it's fun to say and then lastly you're going to get minus X show hands how we made that far great what happens yeah we have positive x negative X that's kind of what you need Happ right geez I told you to get it out ahead of time what's the matter with the so those are gone do you need a tissue yeah yeah I don't have one thanks anybody it's fine good I don't think any else has you're so considerate thank you I care about my students you're paying my salary suckers no I'm just kidding totally joking I love you all uh anyway Please Subscribe 20,000 views is it 20,000 nothing want to get there personal go what happens now hes sure hes do you have anything left on the numerator one oh how sweet thank you so we have now a limit H goes to zero can we let the H go to zero and be okay if we do we get x + 0 which is still x square root of x that's okay plus that's okay so we're okay if we let the H go to zero what we end up getting is notice no more limit you have 1 over < TK x + 0+ < TK X no more limit because I allowed the H to go to zero when you're all said and done what is that going to what's it going to be I'll give you the one one over what two not not X right aunk of X plus a x doesn't equal x that's multiplied but a squ of X Plus X gives you what you just find what is this what's this weird thing that we just found SL oh this is a what that's a slope what you just found is a slope you found the slope of this where' it go you found the slope of that that's crazy look at that this thing right here is the slope it's a slope of this curve which looks like this thing that's how that curve looks it's half of a parabola on its side right what you've just done you've found the slope at any given point which is constantly changing that's pretty impressive so here's my my point could you find the slope at the point 4 comma 2 could you find the slope at the point 16a 4 9 three or or anything else for that matter could you find the slope of that sure even weird numbers find the slope of at the point uh s you could do it it'd be 1 over 2 * the of 7 you could find the slope at that all you got to do now is plug in the x coordinate it will give you the slope of that curve this curve at that point do you get the idea so if I say find the equation of tangent line now for these points well you can do it very easily so never forget that what we're actually doing we're finding the slopes of Curves this thing is the slope of that curve this this curve at any point x so if I had asked you this question so with a specific point you'd right now be plugging in which one the one or the three three You' be plugging in the three now of course 31 is not on this curve the point something like uh 255 is on that curve 25 is 5 so if I said find the slope of the curve at this point which one would you plug in 25 plug in 25 do I'll do it real quick what's square of 25 * 2 10 1110 very easy you just found the slope of this curve it's 1110 that's pretty flat right pretty flat but still positive 1110 could you find the equation of tangent line absolutely you have 1/10 X1 y1 plug it into that and now you have yourself the equation of the tangent line isn't that kind of neat kind of neat you don't have to do the actual specific point anymore you can find the equation of the tangent line Al together well at least the slow are there any questions before we go move on a little bit I want to show you a couple applications of this yeah that's good for the entire domain of this function right this is good for wherever the function is uh defined okay okay yeah now where the function where we're going a little bit beyond where we should right now uh but where this is not going to work is where the function is not continuous obviously because if you have gaps or jumps there's no slope at that point right it just stops one-sidedly you can do it uh so we we if it was continuous to the end point you could do it but if it jumps from point to point well you you can't find this the tangent line of that there is no tangent line for that also sharp points are non what's called differentiable that's finding the slope uh so something a curved that would look like this see that sharp point you cannot find the tangent to that point why well theoretically I mean I could draw an infinite number of tangent lines through that point right CU it it's not uh the slope doesn't I got to got to back up to explain this but what the slope is is a limit going to one point right the slope is that limit that means it has to exist and be the same from both directions the slope going this way is not the same as the slope going this way therefore it would fail the limit would fail therefore the finding the slope would fail does that make sense so non-continuous points limit fails Shar points limit fails because the slopes are not the same and that's what we're looking for I'll explain this in much more detail later but if you have understanding now well that's great preview sneak peek o people love those sneak good question any other questions you ready see some applications applications good how to maybe use this stuff we're going to talk about average velocity then we're going to talk about instantaneous velocity we're going to see the relationship between this and this come to play again average velocity if I talk about average velocity that means average velocity all average velocity is is how far you've gone let me at least write it better for you how far you've gone over how long it took you to get there how far you've gone over how long it took you to get there well that's exactly what this thing that I'm about to write up there says how far you gone can be well F of T Sub 0 + h minus F of T Sub 0 that's how far you've gone let me explain this to you in English F gives you your position true right this is the position when you started this is the position position after a little while that's the plus h did you see that position when you started position after a little while that's the plus h remember that plus h is a little while this is your position after a little while that's how far you've gone if you have your position when you end minus your position when you started that gives you your overall displacement your overall change if we divide that by the time it took you to change that's the H this is the position when you started this is a position after a little while divided by the little while you were traveling in other words displacement over time that's what that says that right there that gives you average velocity now here's the correlation between what we've just done think about this what was this what was this this part this is slope for sure this is actually ignore the limit okay this is slope between two points do you understand that's slope between two points this is instantaneous slope at one point do you see the difference when you get the h z this right here is average veloc it's just the slope between two points that's how you find the average value right you take the slope between two points that's it that's what that is it's the average velocity just a slope between two points that's how you find an average um so let's do one and then I'll show you how to translate this into instantaneous velocity and you're going to see such a connection here are you ready for it so let's let me walk you through how to find out average velocity between a couple points so what if I said find average velocity of here's a position curve according to Time on the interval let's do 1 three let's do 1 three what I want to do right now is simply find average velocity average velocity is a slope between two points now this this will give it to you so what we need to find again is f of T Sub 0 plus h and f of T Sub 0 but before we do that we we might want to identify what is T Sub 0 and what is h so T Sub 0 should be your starting time T Sub 0 starting time what's your starting time no it's not zero your starting time where' you start you started to one yeah that's where you started H is kind of like elapsed time okay it's how much time has passed between when you want to start and when you want to end on this position curve so can you tell me how much time has passed how much is my H not three it' be three if we went from zero to three or we're not we're going from 1 to three how much time has passed two do the subtraction three - 1 is H is 2 you okay with this so far all right now that we have our T Sub 0 = 1 our H equal 2 watch what we can do here what we want to find out and you're going to see that this is just the slope formula again remember we created this from the slope formula right it's all we did this is only a slope formula average velocity then equals F of give me T Sub 0 + H what is T Sub 0 plus how much is H minus F of what's uh what's F of T Sub 0 f of what again all over H how much is H I can't afford to lose you right now I need you to all be with me on this do you see where this one was coming from how about this two how about this one this two this one and that two H yeah so T Sub 0 plus h t Sub 0 plus h we got it f of T Sub 0 all over H you're going to notice that when we're not allowing our H to go to zero we have a legitimate H because there's a legitimate distance between these points do you see what I'm talking about about this is the difference between average velocity and what we're going to do in a minute instantaneous velocity instantaneous says what's the time between an instant well it's pretty darn close to zero right now we actually have a legit time right we have two seconds that or two whatever this is two units of time can you realize that when you do this this is f of 3us f of 1 all over two you with me on that two let me don't change your paper but just watch 3 - 1 that's still two right do you see that this is this is slope formula that's all this is f of 3 says oh well that's Y 2 minus y1 over X2 - X1 that's what this is Y2 - y1 over X2 - X1 do you guys see the slope formula in that it's all that is slope formula is just the average between two points if it's talking about velocity the slope formula this way but we're doing this way so we can take a limit in just a minute to get instantaneous but the slope formula just gives you the average velocity that's it do you guys see the SL formula kind of neat right it looks funky but that's just Y2 - y1 over X2 - X1 how do you find F of three yeah plug that in why don't you do that for me right now plug in F of three tell me what you get oh you know what shoot I got so confused with my FS what should that letter really be S okay thank you you know you can stop me and tell me when I do things like that it doesn't hurt my feelings but I hear from your erasers that you all did the same thing huh all right now it should really be S because we're talking about a position curve we're talking about the S function so s of 3 S of one what is s of three plug in three what do you get88 okay 8 minus uh what's s of one I don't know you tell me it's like two how much is that say what five that means we're going up we're going down our displacements changing on average from natively so we're we're somehow dropping in in our position um if you I ask you to find average speed how would you find average speed maybe you don't know average speed is the absolute value of of average velocity so where velocity has a vector right it's Vector driven which means like you have a direction and a magnitude um speed is not speed is just the magnitude so for instance if I said the average velocity is5 feet whatever we are feet per second the average speed would just be 5T per second are you with me on that so that's our this is our average velocity what it says is are we always going 5T per second no but on average we are from 1 point to the next that's what this says if I Chang this would this stuff change could you still do it sure you understand it's still it's just slope all is is just slope okay I'm not going do this one for you that's the same thing now what we're going to do let's make the jump about instantaneous Bel instantaneous well we already know what average is we just have it on the board over here we have that that's average velocity the question is if H is time not 10 H is not 10 H is time my if H is time and we want to talk about instantaneous velocity how much time elapses in an instant small that's an interesting question isn't it how much time elapses in an instant because when you think about it is it zero very very close if it was Zero that'd be awesome we'd all live forever because time would not EX exist right because if it was Zero you'd add 0 plus 0 0 every instant would have a value of zero to it right we would never age we would just be stuck in the same time that might be boring for you to be stuck in this class for eternity be awesome for me I love this class ex up for you but yeah an instant can't possibly be zero but it can't be anything greater than what greater so we can put our finger on it we can't say it's 0.0000001 tenth of a second or whatever you want to say you can't say it's 00000000000000 1 seconds cuz that would be finite right and you could say then well between one and and the next you can delineate that but instance can be smaller than that is there time between 0.001 seconds and 0.001 seconds yes there's time between that so we no matter how small you make that instant there's something smaller there's something less less small quicker even quicker so from here to here and then quicker than that quicker than that so we can't let it equal zero an instant isn't zero but can we let it approach zero so the idea behind instantaneous velocity is the exact same idea behind uh the slope of curve at a point because if we have this which is our slope and this gave us a slope at a specific point this gives us average velocity and if I let my H go to zero it will give me instantaneous velocity and that's the same thing so what you know now is that the slope of a curve is instantaneous velocity that should make sense if you have a position curve and you find out how fast it's going up at a certain point wouldn't that give you velocity average would be between two points instantaneous is at a single point that's the same idea as the slope between two points and the slope at a single point so instantaneous velocity does the same thing we did with the slope of a curve it says here's the average how do we make it instant I know that this was the average velocity this was a slope between two points what do I want to have happen to the H if I'm talking about an instant where's it going and what's the only thing that will allow me to let H approach zero so I'm take a limit that is instantaneous velocity we have you understand that see the connection between it it's kind of cool right it's same thing uh slope of a curve at a point is instantaneous velocity the slope is average velocity if you're talking about a position curve you want to see an example yes thought you would I hope so at least I have some ready for you for [Music] your position curve is s of T = 500 - 16 T ^2 uh that approximate some gravity curve probably because of6 t^2 that's about how you approximate that uh dropping from maybe a 500t cliff or something I don't know find the instantaneous velocity after 5 seconds so how fast is this thing falling at exactly 5 seconds I don't want average I don't want from zero to five I don't care about that what if I know this is going to in here's a maybe relationship what if I know this is going to impact something at 5 Seconds what I'm going to want to know if I'm going to protect a windshield or something I don't know protect some sort of glass I want to know how how fast that's going so I can say is that glass going to hold up or not right adage isn't going to give it to me instantaneous would so how fast is it going at the moment of impact when's that how fast is that going then you could derive how much force that is and how much uh you you're going to have to hold up under a certain load or whatever whatever that case may be from physics but here right here this is pretty important for us to be able to find the instant velocity of an object at any given time that I say the given time I say is five now you're going to see a connection between what we just did and what we're going to do now because it is the same exact idea what we want to know is instantaneous velocity and what I've given you is that's the limit as H approaches zero s in this case T sub 0 + H - s of T Sub 0 all over H what is your T Sub 0 what's the time at which you want to find the velocity so you know that t Sub 0 is 5 Seconds okay there is no starting and ending time folks you're starting at five and you're stopping at five stopping a little teeny bit past five but so close you can't tell the difference so there is no two times there's no average there is only one there can be be one so it's just anyway so T Sub 0 is 5 can you do what we did before can you find S of five s of 5 + H do you see where the S of 5 and S of 5 plus h are coming from that's what we want up here we actually just did those examples just a little while ago now another question is this could I have asked it a different way could I have asked it hey find me the instantaneous velocity at any time I hope you're hope you're with me on this if I asked it find the instantaneous velocity at any time would you have a five here no would you have a five there you would just leave it as T and then you come up with a formula and you could plug in any time that you want how people feel okay with that that idea so that was the two connections that we we had to make so let's go ahead let's plug this in uh what is s s of 5 + H can you tell me S of 5 + H that says go to the s s position curve and plug in 5 plus h don't not talk at once 500 500 great okay 500 and Sarah you said minus minus what 16 5 16 5+ 5 + 8 5 plus h is nonseparable has to be there 5 + H and then what well let's look at it are you okay getting from here to here you see where it's coming from this is just the position curve at 5 plus h it's a composition take this put it there how much is s of five s of five says take five plug it into your function what do you get 500 - 16 500 - 16 * 5 S sure so 500 - 16 * 25 I have no idea what that is you help help me out with that you have calculators go quick how much it's 100 100 I'll believe you I kind of had some drop off in participation ladies and gentlemen do you know how to find the 100 is it 100 do you know how to find the 100 do you know how to find the 500 -6 5 + h^ S you see where that's coming from you sure we're taking this we're substituting into our function that's 5 + H that's our T Sub 0 plus h that's giving us this expression if we're to substitute these two things well then we've got H we have 500 - 16 5 + h^ 2 - 10050 better okay we'll continue this next time we'll find out exactly how much instan velocity is that out good afternoon how are you guys doing good all right uh we're going to continue talking about this problem now what we're doing is we're trying to find not the average velocity of something which is we found out last time simply the slope between two points we don't want to find the average displacement over time we want to Now find the instantaneous velocity so how fast is an object going moving at a specific point in time an instant like at that one moment it could change before it could change after but right then not an average but an instant like uh I think I gave this example if you're driving down to to LA you go from here to La let's say it's about 300 miles right if you make it in 5 hours how fast were you going see a lot of you are saying 60 right now right because you're doing 300 miles divided by 5 hours would give you 60 mil per hour true that would be your your computation your head however what you just did was an average velocity an average speed as a matter of fact velocity if you want to consider the the direction but that's an average right the overall distance divided by the overall time gives you how fast you're going average now realistically are you going to be driving exactly 60 MPH from Merced La not if you ever been to La uhuh cuz when you get to La you're going like 20 mes an hour when you're in fredd you're like 80 boom and you're you're going right you're not always going 60 you're going faster slower you hit the brakes a semi truck pulls in front of you you flip them off you go faster you know that's just the way it works so we're not talking about the average velocity here we want to know what was your exact speed the moment you crossed the Bakersfield City Limit that's the question we're asking now now what was your exact speed the moment you left Merced you looked at okay I was going 63 maybe I hit Baker speed I'm doing 90 you know it doesn't have to be 60 all the time it could be an instant speed that's what the idea is what we found out is that in order to find the instantaneous velocity we came with a formula that was actually the slope of a curve at a point that's the same exact thing the slope of a curve at a point is the velocity of a certain point of that curve so for us it was did involve a limit or not you remember the reason why it involves a limit is because the H that we're about to put on the board represents your time and in an instant of time how much time passes well very little and that's what we say h is going to zero because very little times passing a little is passing but it's not quantifiable and that's what H approaches zero actually says so we go okay well we know it's a limit as our time our h the distance between t Sub 0 and T sub one the diff the difference in that is going to zero position after you end minus the position when you start gives you your displacement over H which is your distance or sorry your difference in the times how much time has elapsed we're letting H go to zero because we're now taking an instant of time what we need to be good at is taking this information plugging it into this limit and then using what we know about limits to solve the problem let's see if we can do this together are you ready for it so there's two options that you can you have when Computing these instantaneous velocities option number one is well you could compute it for that specific point right in this case what is your T sub Z could you tell me your T sub Z here five sure 5 Seconds T sub Z because that's your starting time and you know what that's also your ending time we want to know what happens at exactly 5 seconds so T Sub 0 would be five the other option that you have is do it in general for any time and then plug in five at the end do you remember us doing that last time we found out the entire uh veloc inst velocity for any time and then we just plugged in a number and found out it was the same as what we thought so we just plug in those numbers later which one would you prefer cuz I don't care do you want to do it with the five or do it in general then plug the five in with the five do with the five whatever so what we want to find out is s of T Sub 0 plus h we need to know that and we need s of T Sub 0 now in our case how much is T Sub 0 please five so this now is five and this is five five five we want to find out those things now it since we have a specific time it's not t sub Z anymore it's well five 5 plus h and S of five are you guys okay with that so far let's see if we can figure this out try it on your own if you'd like I need you to find s so5 and s of 5 + H what does s of 5 mean for you to do plug it into where where sure yeah this says plug in five right there why don't you plug in five there and see how much that gives you has anybody done that already how about s of 5 plus h remember I say it like 5 plus h cuz it's non-separable we don't want s of five and then plus h that would be the wrong way to go we want s of 5 plus h like one thing it's got to be in parenthesis 5 plus h must show up again in parentheses in your problems tell me what s of 5 plus h is going to be please 500 okay I like the 500 then what uhuh 16 great that's got to be there then what please good very good that's just a straight straight up composition right there you're taking 5 + H you're plugging in for T that's all you've done raise your hand feel okay with this so far good deal now we're ready to make a substitution we can take these quantities plug them into those expressions and get our limit so we're going to have a limit instead of s of 5 + H I'm going to put this expression that s of 5 + H is equal to that's 500 - 16 5 + h^ 2 this is s of 5 + H do you agree you sure what's next minus what where you getting the 100 yeah that's s of five so we have that all over how much now it's going to involve some algebra but I need you to break that up I need you to distribute that can you just do 25 + h^2 Square this one square that one does that work please shake your head please no no you're going to have to distribute so distribute that notice we're still writing the limit still a limit it's still going to be over eight you're going to have quite a long expression here here's what's going to happen I'll do this in two steps firstly the 500 stays the same next up I'm going to put the minus 6 16 and then please watch what happens don't do this all in your head don't do this all one time because you're going to make a sign error on the last two terms of this polinomial if you try to do some of this in your head here's what I mean you're going to have this - 16 this means multiply right this you're going to do and you're going to get 25 + 10 H + H2 did you get that as well you sure however notice that this is in parentheses do you see that so what are you going to distribute 16 or Nega 16 that negative is going to change all those signs these second signs are going to change as well so that's important don't forget Theus 100 either so after that help me out let's do this multiplication this is the limit H goes to zero 500 uh tell me the next next few what is that 400 4us 160h m - 16 h^2 and then lastly we'll have this minus 100 don't forget about that hey take a look at the board this is going to be kind of nice do you see anything special that happens here what happens up here what happens what happens to all the constants they're gone you have 500 - 400- 100 you see that all the constants are gone what you're left with is the limit still got to write the limit H goes to Z of 160h - 16 h^2 over H we're on a Ru tell me the next thing we're going to do Factor what your whole idea here your whole idea you can Factor at 16 H as matter of fact if you want to your whole idea here is to cross out H's right that's it that's all you want to do so if I factor out I'm just going to choose the H and I'll show you why in a second why I'm not going to do 16 orative 16 h show you why uh if I factor out the h i get -160 no h- 16 H over H do you agree what happens with H's they're gone okay I love it now that they're gone are you able to evaluate H going to zero well if you do that look what happens then this limit is -60 - 16 * H how much is that- 0 right so - 160 why I didn't factor out the 16 because it's not really necessary if you did you'd have to multiply it by 10 and then you'd still get- 160 you with me on that so on this in our problem we have negative what's 160 what's that even mean what's - 160 what did we just find you got to know you got to know what we just found okay you're both right I heard some people say instantaneous velocity I heard some people say slope you're both right what you've done is You' found the slope of this curve at a specific time what time was that in other words you found out how fast this particle is was it falling or climbing how fast this particle is falling after exactly 5 seconds so when you took a stopwatch you went five and and you you time it and you said how fast is it going 160 whatever it is meters per second feet per second whatever this is based on that's what you're finding this is the instantaneous velocity in units per second so let's assume it's feet feet per second or meters per second miles per second however however uh what our units are does this make sense to you could you do the same thing in general so for instance if I said now now do it for the time of 7 Seconds well you wouldn't run and redo the whole thing right so in that case if I asked you for several times it might be best not to use the five at all right now might be best to leave it in terms of T if you did would you like to see that it comes out the same you want to see that yeah let's say we leave it in terms of T what this is going to do is give you a formula for the slope a formula for the instantaneous velocity and then you plug the time in later that's kind of nice notice what's changed we don't have an actual number to plug in right s of T we just write down s of T you okay with that yes no s of t plus h well sure we have t plus h over here if we do this if we if you substitute in these expressions for these uh the function notation up here we have 500 - 16 t + h^2 that's this minus I need to put parentheses around this because I'm sub subtracting this entire expression 500 - 16 t^2 got to do that all over H from here on out man the calculus is almost done I mean all you got to do is do some algebra do you see but firstly why we have to have those parentheses subtracting that entire expression this negative is going to change to a plus that's going to really affect your problem if if you didn't do that some things are not going to work out right for you here we'll have 500 minus 16 and then in here we'll get T ^2 + 2th H + h^2 just just spoiling t^2 2th H h^2 - 500 + 16 T ^2 if we distribute that -16 -16 t^2 - 32 th oops - 16 h^ 2 - 500 + 16 T ^2 all over H hey I'm doing this fast if I made a mistake you need to let me know have you guys been able to follow that am I right on that we're all right so far so we dist Ed got all this stuff together what's the next thing you're going to do what do you think probably combine anything you can right combine anything you can so let's look at what happens what can you combine what happens up here on my problem 500s they're even easier to see here right 500 500 what else look what would have happened if you forgot to distribute the negative you'd have negative 32 t^2 wouldn't you the H wouldn't factor out you wouldn't be able to simplify it you would be stuck but here here since we got our signs correct those are gone can you combine those ones but we can yeah we can Factor the H out I'll give you two steps here we got -32 [Music] th sorry minus 16 h^2 all over H yeah of course we can Factor the h so okay we'll do that we'll factor out the H remember I don't want I don't care about factoring the numbers right now you're going be pluging them in anyway or you're plugging a number to this anyway so you don't you don't care about that the hes are going to zero ultimately you get the same exact thing we just care in this case to to simplify out that H show H how many people are with me so far feel okay on this good deal have you seen that after you after you know the limits it's really just about your algebra they say that people take calculus to finally fail Algebra I I don't want that to happen to you I want you to know your you know your algebra the calculus is actually quite easy it's not going to be hard the fundamentals you'll all have those down I guarantee you'll have them down because I'm teaching it to you but it's the algebra be very cautious on your algebra your signs just simple stuff hes are gone can you let H go to zero now yes yeah do you also let T go to zero no we're just talking about H so this is what wait a second though why why does this have a t in it because this is now a general formula for the slope it's now a general formula for the instantaneous velocity now if I say hey find me the velocity at 8 seconds could you do it how about 5 Seconds how about 0 seconds CU you find it at any point that I ask you and this is a little bit more powerful than the thing we just did so now at 5 Seconds jeez I hope I hope it works out right it doesn't look like an idiot at 5 Seconds the velocity would be -32 * 5 is that what we had before yeah stressful stressful job I have here 160 again feet per second same exact thing same sign even by the way how would you get speed from this this is a velocity how do you get speed so what's the speed here 160 feet per second so speed doesn't have a direction velocity does so if you get a a question says what's the or what's the instantaneous speed well you just take your absolute value your instantaneous velocity and you'll get the speed it's just the magnitude of U of that Vector not not the direction so how can velocity be measured negative and posi up positive up and down down negative climbing falling okay Rockets have a positive velocity when they're climbing and a negative velocity when they're falling this was a band thrown off the cliff 500t Cliff you had negative velocity that's what happened true story okay uh last thing another section here there's another connection I need to make for you uh you already you already know that this calculus stuff is pretty intriguing because we've just found out the slope of a curve at a point is the same thing as instantaneous velocity right so we find out the same way which is kind of cool the other thing we're going to find out is something about rates of change rate of change you know we normally say that what is our rate of change for instance if I give you a straight line like this what is the rate of change what do we call that slope no not it is a straight line already right so the straight line can't have a tangent to it well unless you it can't have a tangent to it consider that to be a tangent the straight line is itself has a sorry in and of itself has a rate of change and we call that rate of change slope we say we're going up two and over one right or going up one or and over five going down and all that stuff that's a rate of change so slope is a rate of change just a basic example here what's the rate of change why would you say 3 over one he's right why would you say 3 over one that's SL slope is a rate of change so the rate of change is 3 over 1 how about for this one what's the rate of change there sure negative one of one if you want to say one or just negative one would be the rate of change all right here's what this says to us here's the jump we can make well if slope is a rate of change and we know that well if if you look at this velocity to a rate right the rate of change change here instantaneously was well the slope of a curve at a point and that's what we're saying here if we want to find an instant rate of change for a curve that's just the slope of the curve a rate of change is a slope right if we want to find the slope of a curve that's instantaneous rate of change and that's what we're saying so since of rate of change is a slope an instantaneous rate of change is the slope of a curve at a point for of course we need to make it a little bit more mathy than that here's the mathy part of it this going go very quick because you can see it's exactly the same thing that we've just been doing okay here's a rate of change this would be considered your average rate of change average rate of change is exactly like this it will be that why that is that also secant in other words it is the what between two points dist not the distance distance form have squ it's the average that's what it says average sure but what does this formula give you oh come on we spent so much time doing that what's that formula quo difference quo gives you what the not not the tangent but the slope of the tangent yes so what is this this is just slope right that's just slope between two points that's what we're saying the rate of change is a slope the rate of change is a slope that's an average rate of change how I find the instantaneous rate of change is do what to this thing a put a limit on front as H approaches what yeah so that's how we're going from an average rate of change to an instantaneous are you starting to see that every one of these things is almost identical average is just a slope okay instantaneous is the limit of that slope saying find it at a point that's all that's all we're doing so if this is the average rate of change the instantaneous rate of change is identical to an instantaneous velocity it's identical to the slope of a curve at a point it is a limit as H approaches zero of the slope it says what's the slope as you approach one point that's it now is it acceptable to solve saying uh say we want instain velocity to first work out our slope of our secant and then just once we have that all worked out then just add the limit to it and solve that way definitely not because your slope of secant is going to be an actual IAL value right like five when you take the limit of five it's always five so what you're saying is what what you'd be implying there is this question maybe I'm saying it wrong here's the question you're you're implying is the slope between those two points which is your average slope your average rate of change understand is this slope the same as this slope possibly what about this slope no what about this slope that slope that slope that's right no no no no no no so no you can't just do the average rate of change and say oh this is also an instantaneous rate of change I'm take a limit you can't do that what you can do is say I'm going to consider my slope function and then make the H go to zero and that's that's a different way of saying okay that's what like on the test we could figure out solve for get rid of the H on the bottom and then add in our limit once we've had it all simplified down and then solve the limit yeah that's exactly what you're doing here okay that's that's it okay well I'm not going to do this problem for you but I would like to set up just talk about it a little bit let's say that I have uh oh a problem to find the average and the instantaneous rates of change of a of a curve the average I'd like that over 2 comma 5 and the instantaneous at a point of two can you explain to me maybe a little critical thinking here why am I giving you a range of numbers for the average but I'm only giving you I'm actually give end points for the average but I'm only giving you one number for the instantaneous why is that one oh well it's not technically at one point but it's over such a small distance that we consider it to be one point right so what we want to know here is average is over yeah it's over distance of time right it's over a distance and a Time saying compare the distance to this overall elapse time how much time elapses in an instant pretty close to zero that's why I give you only one point here so could you do both of these things with this information we're just going to talk about it I'm not going to do it for you because I've already given like five examples of the same thing here's how you do the average in our case our average our starting spot would be what's our x sub Z for this case that's where you start how much is your h why why is it three good so in our case right here x Sub 0 would be 2 H would be three because that's the distance that's the elapsed time that it took that would be two that would be three are you okay on the average average rate of change for that one you plug in the two because that's where you started you plug in the three because that's how long it took you you'd calculate that you plug it into your function we've done all this stuff before you take your five you take your two and divide by three you plug in your five to your function plug in your two to your function then you figure that out and divide by three can you follow that you sure all right do I need to do it for you are you okay okay that was not an answer silence yes no no you all right yeah see it good I want to do it anyway forget you guys plug in five plug in the two what do you get when you plug in five 71 what you me plug in two 8 over 3 71 - 8 that would be your average rate of change for that that's how you figure it out plug in the five plug in there to to your function I plugged in right here then divide by your H that's average I'm definitely not going to show you the instantaneous right now because we've just done that for instantaneous again you have two options your X Sub 0 would be -2 so you could find -2 + h f of -2 then do your limit right or you could just do this with your function and then plug the number in later we just did that example right here we did that twice I showed you how to plug in the number and I showed you how to not plug in the number and do it later that's the same exact problem right there how many people feel okay with with this one good deal now we're 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 2.1:  Introduction to the Derivative of a Function
two point one is called the derivative an ominous sounding title this thing should look familiar jeez I hope that looks familiar to you good because if it doesn't you haven't been here the last 45 minutes and that looks familiar we've used this for a few things we've used this to find the instantaneous rate of change we use it to find in stays velocity we've used it to find the slope of a curve at a point you're easier to find the equation of a tangent line by finding the slope of that curve then making that equation out of it so this is I'll just call this because it's what all those things mean this is the slope of the curve at a point so primitive point this thing which I have already told you stands for the slope right this thing says as you approach one single point so this is the slope of a curve that's f at a single point you got the idea what this idea represents is something called the derivative so what is the derivative there you go my job is done I won't touch of that I've taught you a derivative I just didn't tell you what's a derivative this thing is a rivet this idea is a true well here's the thing about it all right you're going to be taken lots of derivatives and like I told you before people in calculus that usually they get so involved in doing the computation they forget what you're actually doing what are you doing when you're finding a derivative what are you finding that's what you're doing what are you doing everybody you're finding that that's what a derivative represents this thing is a slope of a curve at a point that's the derivative function it's telling you how to find the slope of a curve at a point so we're taking derivatives that's all we're doing and there's a special notation for the derivative looks like this that's the function right that we're talking about here how you say go from a function to a derivative it's very easy I'll give you some more notation later on but you go okay this is a function if that's a function that's a drew the little apostrophe thing up it's not a 1 it's not a 1 it's a like that some people have a little - it's not a 1 the derivative of the function that's what it says the derivative of function or the slope of this function at any point that I want is the limit as H approaches 0 of the difference quotient we've already talked about and you know what in general we're not going to have a specific point so I'm going to raise the X of 0 I'm gonna say we're not going to do this at specific point anymore maybe we'll do that later what we care about is the derivative function we want the equation like we did here we want the equation for the slope of the curve at a point you would do that we're going to stop doing this for a specific point we might plug in some afterwards well I want the function itself because what you found out in the last example of a fear was if I told you to plug in more than one point that gets pretty cumbersome and tedious right if you do it for every single point that sucks we want to find out this thing the function and then be able to plug in any amount of time or any x value that I want that's better so I'm going to leave off the X of 0 signifying a specific fixed point I'm going to say just find me in the general function for the derivative the derivative function and that's that this is the derivative of f with respect to X the derivative of F with respect to X says that rid of that function a death taking X as our variable also you can say this as Prime like Optimus Prime cool but F Prime so this would be like the math for Jionni another of F prime F prime of X say that with me f prime of X that means the derivative of F with respect to X so f prime of X I'd say that let's see we get time for a couple examples would you like to see a couple more on how to do these derivatives now we get column derivatives they do imply that it is a instantaneous rate of change an instant ace bilasa T if your view of the pacific position curve the slope of curve at a point if you're just dealing with a basic function you want to see some examples let's do this thing okay so I want you and I want us to find the derivative of this function so that would be wait now do this squared find the derivative of this function and then I want you to find the equation of the tangent line to that function at a certain point can hit that's a great test question that's code word for word that's most likely gonna be on your test pretty close I'm not very original Scott so I figured you can do it you can show me anyway the derivative of that function and then find the equation tangent line so first thing I want to do I want you to find f prime of X now this is nothing new because all this is is the limit f of X plus h minus f of X all over H I showed you several times on how to do that yeah I showed you that I need you to label out f of X plus h and label out f of X and if you can do those things and you can substitute them into those expressions and you can work the algebra this actually works itself not too bad the calculus is very easy now it's really you just have to manipulate tell me what is f of X in this case everybody what is it yes that's definite f of X now I need to be able to find f of X plus h X plus h that means X plus 8 should show up in parentheses in your problem tell me what it is - ok I like it - then one okay definitely put the C's and do I have a -3 or not let's stop right there real quick pause make sure you're okay are you okay I'm getting f of X and the X f of X plus h in our graph no yes let's try this again if you are no then don't raise your hand if you're a yes then raise your hand are you okay getting these two things that's how I check okay over here okay cool let's take those expressions plug in so instead of f of X plus h I got two X plus h squared minus three - here's my f of X plus h I've already got that now I want to subtract f of X which is two x squared minus three tell me the gigantic flaw that I have on my board right now very good yeah that's got to be there because that's going to change your sign you're subtracting that entire at the back set that will expression so we'll keep on going here we're going to distribute we'll get to X plus h squared is x squared plus 2xh plus h squared minus three minus two x squared plus three sure the plus three is coming from just ripping that negative out there that's going to give us that plus three all over H a couple more steps well we still got to distribute that to so we'll get our 2x squared plus 4x h plus 2h squared minus three minus two x squared plus three all orig now I know it looks nasty but is this really hard to do I really it's mostly just algebra but supposed to combine like terms and descriptive distribution just keeping your signs correct at this point they're not even hard limits shoot I've given you some really hard limits in this class haven't I trig functions all sorts of crap like that this is easy compared to those this you just got a factor stuff and that's not that at all so we got a limit as H goes to zero if I combine all the stuff a lot of things should and must cross out and otherwise you basically here's the point if you don't cross out everything with an 8 if everything that doesn't have an H in it here's not your work out for you because you're going to have to factor this H out at some point and be able to work with it in some way so the X Squared's are gone the threes are gone I get 4x h plus 2h squared all over age if we continue of course you will notice I'm still writing limit because we haven't taken the limit yet when we factor out the H we get 4x plus 2h all over H tell me what happens now this is a good part that's what we wanted to have happen can you insert that H equals zero yeah we let H go to zero that means this term goes to zero as well that means we still get a 4x filling it with that one there's an assess what you just done you found the derivative so if f of X equals 2x squared minus three F prime of X that's first derivative the first derivative of F with respect to X is 4x okay what did you just fun so this slope of what curve source Oulu tangent line sure at some point slope of which curve this curve does this change for other curves yes the derivative is different for every curve like what you found is the slope of f the slope of this curve at which point end point now here's a second for this question find the equation of the tangent line to f of X at 2/5 what two things do you need to make the equation of a line do you have a point points have to be given to you do you have a slope kind of you have a formula for the slope right get a formula so here's your slope and here's your point how do you find your slope okay I definitely need voice up on it okay great y minus y1 equals M X minus x1 okay great what is my y1 I need more participation this what's my x1 2 so would you agree I'm going to do Y minus 5 equals x minus 2 would agree with that the question is and this is what I asked you originally what goes there some people give me a number some people give me 4x listen if I want the equation of a tangent line I want the equation of tangent line specific to this point if you put 4x in here this gets nasty right this is nasty don't do that if I want the equation of tangent line I want y equals something X plus something I want an equation of a tangent line Angela it's a straight line but for us here that's what I'm talking about the sort of tangent lines are straight lines I don't want for X that was what I'm trying to say that's the formula for your slope that's not the slope itself that's the formula for slope at any point tell me what point am I talking about good what's the x-value for my point plugin - so the slope will be look at F prime of 2 F prime of 2 this says this it says this is the slope at the point x equals 2d do you see the notation slope that to slope of 2 is going to be 4 times 2 or 8 that is my slope that's how you find your slope you deal with your slope function slope formula you just plug in your x value how many will solve that feel okay with that one cuz I have a lot of people get stuck here they go well what do I do I just have the derivative what do I do the derivative if they sound like that but you plug in your x value that's how you find the slope this is only a formula for the slope you got to use it to find slope the slope is at well your x value - in this case if it was a different point it'd be a different X right I could just say at x equals 3 you plug in 3 just plug in the value that will give yourself after this very Elementary add 5 and not too long at a time we've just found the equation of a tangent line that's the line that will touch this specific curve at one point and that point is 2/5 so we found that laser lines can touch that curve at 2pi but you have to realize here today well we put a lot of things together damn glad you were here so from last time we're still working on derivatives and we've already done the derivative of 2 x squared minus 3 let's look at fine driven something a little bit more complicated remember personally what the derivative does for you sure slope tangent line or in other words the slope of a curve at a point right and we've gone past the the stage of just buying at a specific point what we're doing is we're finding the formula for the slope that way we can plug in any point that we want if I the slope at any point remember that that was the last thing we were working on so let's go ahead let's find the derivative which is so conservative point you remember how to write the derivative of f of X by the way good F prime of X that looked like a little - so find F prime of X or f of X equals two X cubed minus X basically here's a lot of derivatives set instead then you can find the derivative or the slope of a tangent line to occur but slope of a curve at a point at any point by taking a limit our fun limits that we have fortunate these are a little bit easier than some trig limits we know as H approaches 0 f of X plus h minus f of X all over H that's the idea if we can fill those things out and work with it that we'll have our function on will have a derivative of what I told you to do is find f of X plus h and find f of X before you fill it out find it off to the side so my question is can you tell me what is f of X in our situation right here let's start easy good are you okay with the two x cubed minus x where that's coming from so let's just start our function that's all gonna list down now we've got to go ahead and find the f of X plus h f of X plus h says do I just add H at the very end is that the appropriate thing to do no it's like X plus h it says you can't separate that thing so tell me what is f of X plus h ok good so even where we see the X we're going to insert that entire explanation remember doing that also so it'll be x + H to the O cubed - so it does have to be X plus h in that as well so everywhere we saw an X we're now putting X plus a 2 in parentheses ok so hands how many will feel ok with that so far now we're about ready to go ahead and substitute this into our our function just make sure you do one thing remember that what this says is you're subtracting f of X right subtracting the whole thing so if you're subtracting that whole thing what do I need along with that 2x cubed minus X I need something with it right because that minus is going to distribute change of signs are you with me on that if I do it just like this this is good this great this bad expert bad why is that bad yeah this says I'm subtracting 2x cubed but I'm not subtracting the minus X this would say the appropriate thing for us that would say do you see the difference there what would you see why we need that we're subtracting the entire function f of X subtracting the entire function f of X and then putting over H now we're going to do some fancy algebra you need to know how to distribute X plus h to the third power if you ever heard of Pascal's triangle this will work for you have you run faster before that's the way that you can expand this to term or binomial expansion to any power that you want I guarantee and this is going to be without doing much work because you need to foil it out right sometimes I will get into it I'll do the X cubed plus 3x squared H plus 3x H squared plus base to third power guarantee is like that if you want to learn how to do that with high stats guys trying to come and see me or look that up it gives you the coefficients 1 3 3 1 for every row of Pascal's triangle that's how you do that minus 2x cubed plus X Oh so I've just done this little part that's all I've done what's that going to be when I'm done with that okay and then minus two X cubed and once you see where the plus X is coming from the very end minus and negative we're going to be adding that ultimately okay last a little bit if we distribute that 2 X cubed we'll do that next time we'll go ahead and stop there I'll talk about how to finish this up later okay so we're working on a problem we're trying to find the derivative which is what's driven via thank you one of you where's my boss now yeah slope of a curve at a point folks is what a derivative is what you need to know so every time I asked you that question what's a derivative it is a slope of a curve at a point that is what you're finding here you get me we're finding the function of the slope right now yes we're inviting in general so we've made it down this far we have our difference quotient and that means the slope difference quotient basically just gives you the slope at 22 points we're just allowing those two points to come really really close together that's why the H goes to 0 says that distance between the points is shrinking it's collapsing to 0 and that's going to give us a slope not at two points but at one point which is in fact a tangent line we've done the difference quotient f of X plus h there you go f of X we plug that in we've worked it out and now we're going to see that everything except for terms that have an H of them hmm pretty much have to go away because if they don't you're not gonna be able to factor that H and you're not going to cancel out that H which is exactly what you want to do let's see if that happens here do all my terms that don't have h in them disappear jeez I hope so cause let's see does the 2x cubed go but yes gone how about the X yes yes that's everything that doesn't have an H what that means is that you should be able to factor out an H from the rest of it if you can factor out an H from the rest of it you're going to have H over H that's something we can simplify you get me on this so I'm going to work over here this gives us the limit H to 0 of would you mind if I factored out an H as we went you okay with that so I'm going to factor in H this is our many terms this negative H to H cubed 6h 6 X squared 6x squared H so I'm going to factor out the H and get six x squared plus six x do I still have an H here yeah okay good you need to see that plus two H squared - one Frigidaire fueler ever done so far with factorization cool reason why this works now you have the H over H as soon as you can factor you can simplify that out you can't do it before then but now we can simplify those nature's away are you now able to plug in H equals zero and get something out of it sure let's do it what happens do I still have a 6x squared and that doesn't have an H attached to it so 6x squared right there how about the plus 6x H that's zero why is it zero yeah you're really doing this 6x times zero because 8 is 0 plus 2 times 0 squared because well H is 0 how about the minus 1 goes to of that yes absolutely so this is going to be your first derivative called the first derivative 6x squared minus 1 okay now test you on what I said two seconds ago what do we just fine [Music] right exactly whatever you mumble you're right sure yeah we found this I think I think I've heard from like 10 of you maybe all of you if you're doing ESP or something we have the slope of this curve where whatever I want yeah wherever I want if I say at x equals 3 you can find it x equals 3 huh I'm not going to I'm not going to because but we could do it right if I said fine at x equals 3 how would you go about doing that you plug in 3 to this that's going to give you the slope just the slope are you with me you plug in 3 to this to actually find the point you follow me on that one so if I ask you for at find the equation at x equals 3 the slope is going to be f prime of 3 the point is going to be 3 comma whatever you get when you plug in that point in our case I plug in 3 tell me what I get when I plug in 3 51 the slope would be when I plug in 3 here if I do that I'm going to get 5351 is right right that would be my do you see how we're getting the quickly through that do you see where we're getting the point from the point comes from my original function that that's what gives you points on your graph the slope comes from your derivative function so you plug that in we find the slope you can now use point-slope and figure out that equation very easily it'll be a straight line all your tangent lines will be straight bottoms how many will feel okay with this example at least get as far as a derivative all right would you like a couple more examples yay fantastic what a good Friday all right more tables first example is this you're going to find something up kind of an interstate here [Music] now we're actually do a little critical thinking about this could we use this whole shebang this whole in a thing to find the slope of that because this stands for slope right could we do that to find the slope however look at that what is that yeah that's one of these once one of those a slope intercept they give you a linear equation could you look at this and tell me what my slope is here what's my slope then I guarantee you if you were able to if you were doing that your slope is three no matter what because that's a constant right that slope doesn't change at all that's a straight line without doing any work at all I know that the slope or my first derivative is going to be three from that function because the slope is 3 what I'll write out for here for you here is if you have any slope-intercept form of a line don't waste your time doing that you need to know what you're doing by finding a derivative what are you doing by finding a derivative you're finding the slope of a curve at a point right what's the slope of this curve at any point because lines don't change slope of that curve is n no matter why so for for any y equals MX plus B slope equals M it's a constant it doesn't change it's a constant doesn't change at all so with any line that that's pretty easy we have to do that formula at all we just know that the slope of a line is that that M that number that coefficient of x which is pretty cool so the slope of a any straight line is just and that works for our derivatives as well okay let's deal this one that's I did want to show you that so if you got that on your homework and you like Lao you can do all this stuff now if you get a straight line just take the derivative and that's just additional slope it's a shortcut I guess but a really a shortcut yarding on the slope is I'm just telling you that derivative means slope right for real so if you know the slope is automatically that is your derivative don't waste time now how about this one here we were able to use this because the slope of the line is always constant is the slope of this thing constant is that straight line you know how that looks you'll do like a dance move yeah maybe like a disco will do all the Exponential's later I didn't do this goes I'm not that old that was my best disco impersonation anyway let's go ahead let's find the derivative and the equation for the tangent line at x equals 4 new tracks first thing we got to do of course well in order to find the derivative this is not easy like our lines alright we can't just look at the angle oh the slope is we don't know right we don't know so we're going to have to use the formula for the derivative for the slope so in other words we're going to have to fill out this pain why don't you try that now go ahead and give it a try remember how we do it is we want to find f of X and f of X plus h and non-separable X plus h separately and then plug them in go ahead try that shouldn't take you long for this one by the way you can do this one of two ways you can plug in a specific value for X if you'd like to what I prefer you to do is do the derivative in general so this is a secondary question okay and the equation of the tangent line I want to find the derivative first what we're most worried about right now is finding the function for the derivative do you get me on that so please if you if you plug in for just erase that put the X I want the formula for the derivative and then we'll be plugging in that point do you understand the difference there so we're finding that in general that way if I give you a different point like x equals 5 you don't the reach of all your work because that would that be length but as you've like 10 different tangent lines you don't want to do this 10 different times you wanna do it once and then just plug in 10 different numbers it's way quicker you see the difference that's what I want from so here for f of X plus h I'm going to have the square root of what square root of x plus h or x plus h hopefully like that f of X well that's a square root of x did you get those two things correct now we just have to substitute those into their respective places so this is going to give us the limit as H goes to 0 of the square root of x plus h minus square root of x all over H ah ah so all those limits that I gave you where you had square roots minus something else wasn't just arbitrary because now you're seeing some of the techniques that we use for our limits from the last couple chapters remember that how do you get rid of that how'd you get it so we did that are you going to distribute the top yes should be the bottom heck no you're trying to get rid of the H so this wasn't just useless practice we were doing it's why I made such a point of this when I went over a couple things with you that these parentheses you're about to put on here are meaningless never be talking about those parentheses oh please not your head did you ever talk about parentheses good so I hopefully wasn't just talking to a wall and we need parentheses because we're multiplying this factor times that entire expression which lets us ultimately cross us up out simplified okay now you can help me out with this I know I still have a limit as H goes to zero when I distribute the numerator which I do have to do because listen listen what you're trying to do is get rid of the radicals up here right wherever you're trying to get rid of the radicals that's what you distribute should i distribute the H no no I'm not trying to remove any radicals from right there so whatever you're trying to rationalize that's what you distribute what if you're not trying to rationalize that's what you're going to try to cross out ultimately if you were to distribute this now you'd have to refactor it later you don't want to do that you won't leave it the way it is so you can cross the H out that's your whole goal across the H out so we're going to get help me out here okay I get the X plus h I got the X because the square root times itself gives you the radicand that's the part inside the square root we're going to get plus and minus the same exact thing you see it what's left - that's right all over don't repeat that anything nice that happens they have to they have to only thing you can have left up there is something with an exit you can factor out across that itself otherwise this one falls apart so those X's are gone okay foot out I like the HS going away what do we have remaining good we don't just have this Cartwright's obits under one so it becomes a one are you okay to plug in the H wait a second H is so in the denominator is that okay sure because when I plug it in ice I get X plus zero that's fine that's still X this is something so here I have after I plug in the H I stop writing the limit I have one over the square root of x plus zero that's square root of x plus the square root of x can you make it that for ya can't put this together get to read X 1 over 2 root X show hands how many people feel okay with our derivative or with that good remember when you add root X plus root X you'll get X you get 2 root X okay that's not what its rid of it's multiplication that does now we're almost done at this point we've got to use slope intercept I'm sorry point slope we need a point and slope to find the equation of any line so I mean she takes point slope do we have a point written we have a X how do you get the Y because right now we need we need the slope which is I don't know and we need a point I can tell you the x coordinate of X corner for the point is or or okay how do you find the next part of that we plug it in here what's this again that's slope good what gives you points you're functioning where am I there that gives you points plug it in here this will give you points so plug in for here what are you so this is the point four two are you okay with that remember our function well it's simply the square root of x right square root of x says if I plug in 4 I'm going to get out to that gives me the point now this thing should give you the slope don't plug this into slope intercept point slope form that'd be ridiculous you want a number to plug in so if I were to plug in 4 here what's that going to give me clean ones 1/4 very good because square root of 4 is 2 2 times 2 is 4 that's 1 over 4 so f prime of oh it says that prime of X even that's kind of nice what's your ex your ex is 4 plug that in that's 1 over 2 times the square root of 4 ok I need to know are you ok on finding the slope not sure if you are and the point you see where those things are coming from hey plug him in and give me a slope intercept go ahead and do that hip in there ready I'm making nice points but in that sky I am today just today one day that could same old okay-y minus 10 equals 1/4 X minus 4 distribute y minus 2 equals 1/4 X minus 1 add 2 y equals 1/4 X plus 1 that's it that's it what's interesting what's kind of neat about what we're doing here this curve is kind of this curve is kind of crazy right in this it does this it's half of a parabola on its side well that line will do if you were to graph it you grab both of them on your graphing calculator that's going to make the half parabola on its side this is going to make a straight line intersecting the y axis at 1 the slope of 1/4 it will guarantee to intersect this curve now intersect it at exactly x equals 4 at the point 4 2 at one point one point only that's kind of neat right so could you tell me what's the slope of this curve at the point 4 it's 1/4 what's the equation for the tangent line it's right there so cup 1/4 I'm gonna feel arrived at that one good all right we're going to do one more example and then I'm going to tell you a little bit more about this idea of derivatives where you can take them where you can't take them and why and so a little bit more Theory for so one more example application action do you remember what instantaneous velocity was instantaneous though average velocity between two points what's someone said it what was it it involves a limit right in fact in instantaneous velocity was simply what we found out is a derivative it was a limit of the sale of the slope of the slope between two points said instantaneous said a slope of a curve at a point that's that's what it was in fact we we had basically the same thing with a tea instead of a X where F was the position curve does that look familiar to you that wasn't Stace philosophy and I gave it to you a while back well if this is true notice that all this is this is equal to the first derivative of your your math right that's what that formal is what that says to us is that if this gives you the instantaneous velocity and this is simply the formula for the first derivative velocity is just and now we can say it for real velocity is simply the first derivative of a position function now we might have known that just from this but now we can say for real so this is instantaneous velocity which is denoted V of T instantaneous velocity is simply the first derivative of a position curve instantaneous velocity is the derivative of a position curve let's do one example just to flesh it out a little bit the only thing that's 1,250 feet tall it's 5,000 feet i'ma call and find David sure let's say that 10 stories under 10 stories time say yeah that's about right so let's say this is the Empire State Building and you're up there and you with someone you really don't like my ex-girlfriend whatever age go okay that's what this is nobody's ex-girlfriends just kidding joking you will never push off Hilton right besides there's fences up there you couldn't do it if you plotted at the 1258 anyway just joking this is about the effect of gravity if you just kick something off a ledge jet so this is saying so your visit your position is starting at 1,250 feet and you're just gonna throw something off it's going to fall that's what negative 16t squared will do for you does that make sense in a vacuum you know we're not living the vacuums being a vacuum I wanna do three things I want to find the velocity the instantaneous velocity the formula for that I want to find out when this hits the ground I will find out what's the velocity when it does hit the ground so three-part question so first part find V of T second part win it round third part how fast how fast hip drum that's our questions can you please tell me how you can find the velocity of that position curve what are you going to do right now you take the derivative once you go ahead and do that take the derivative for me you already know all this stuff to take derivatives so take the derivative of that thing the loss it equals the first derivative of your position curve in this case s so s prime is velocity for you that's how you would signify that I'm going to start working out slowly keep working on your papers let's see if we come up with the same thing okay I'll go through the step-by-step but on the real stuff that's a square sorry have you notice that a lot of this is just algebra work who knows that mostly just algebra you're like dang it I pastels robot the heck letter balls dogs room okay by show of hands can you raise your hands you made it down to this far for me to make it there good okay have you made it that far you have the understanding for calculus down you have to understanding how to use that formula down the rest of it is just your algebra work distribution combine like terms things like that so in our case for us keep on words if you want to hopefully you saw why those more important right so you don't have them you're 16 T squared you're not going to go away and you need them to go away so if ever you come up with something where you're like man I'm not able to factor out an H you've probably made a mistake go back and fix your mistake it's probably what happened did you make it that far this side yes good beside just all the good stuff happen make it supposed to everything besides an H goes away okay oh that's gone that's gone I see only two terms each of them has an H let's back to the H negative 32 t minus 16 H remember I'm not so caring whether you factor out the numbers I don't care because you're going to be multiplying them anyway in just a second so all I really care about you for you right now is getting her that H that's the key here because that lets you take the limit as H goes to zero if you do that tell me what my velocity curve is equal to what happened to the negative 16 let me worry about find that good for you that's fantastic you got that you got the derivative down that is the instantaneous velocity at any point so right now we've answered vo T it is negative 32 T where T is the time that's right T's the time and we'll say I think this is in seconds so a gravity should be in say so this is in seconds next question what's in the ground when does something hit the ground when the position is zero so we just handed the ground if this was like a y-axis I started 6 feet and I drop it hits the ground after it reaches a height of 0 right what gives you height the first derivative or the actual function the function does so we want to know when does this thing make 0 that's the question you've done that since your introductory algebra class you want to find out what wins you can hit the ground when does 1250 minus 16 T squared equals 0 when's the height equals 0 that's what you're actually here do you see that that's the height right when's the height equals 0 find that one L oh come on you got this sulfur team salty there's nothing fancy about it just get T by itself which means you're going to probably either subtract 1250 or I would choose to add 16 T squared to both sides next step you're going to do 1 divided by 16 you have simple T squared so divided by 16 what's 1252 I can't do that in my head how much seventy eight point one seven eight nine eight get rid of the square how do you do that screw sure now what do you have to do when you take square root hey you typically would however we're dealing time right so as a negative square of is that going to work force negative time what happened in the past man crazy no what you do on the actual time yet technically you put a square root right but we don't do that because we're always moving forward in time so we're just going to leave the positive nothing negative take a square root of seventy eight point one two five four 8.8 for what 8.36 okay 358 so however much you want to be after here you can be even more out under here just so you know because you're going to plug in that number in just a bit so you said eight-point let's do 3 9 okay you said eight point three eight eight so eight three eight three eight eight I don't have a calculator from me eight point eight three eight let's do eight point three four that sounds good seconds cuz I'm assuming this is in seconds so when will it the ground it's going to hit the ground after eight point eight four seconds how fast is it going was hitting the ground well this is a combination of these ideas do you know when it's gonna hit the ground do you have a formula for telling you how fast something goes at an instant of time right there if you want to find out how fast it's going when it's the ground you now have a function in terms of T and you have a T plug it in it'll tell you how fast it's going when it gets the ground it'll also give you the direction that's going when it's hitting the ground not shortly after because it's going to be stuck but before so how fast that would be V of 8.8 four seconds that's negative 32 times eight point eight four keep in mind this is like neglecting the terminal velocity things to be like an adaptive okay so how fast is that going to 82 82 82 or 83 per second negative I'm sorry 288 yeah 282 283 that's pretty fast that says it's falling at a rate of 218 feet per second at the moment that it hits the ground if you were some sort of an engineer we need a little bit more complex of a thing here depend on what you're dropping you'd have wind resistance and stuff like that but you probably calculate a basic structural integrity if something's going to fall off of a 1,200 foot ledge and hit something you to calculate so it withstands a forceful impact abut up to 280 to 0.88 feet per second on top of that roof of your cab or something like that if you're working on a ledge rocks drop off you get the idea so that's our that's our idea it's kind of useful stuff pretty pretty cool can't do that normally only with calculus and limits can you actually find an instantaneous velocity so neato torpedo next up you know the next thing we got to talk about we've been taking all these derivatives we need to discuss when you can actually take a driven that's called differentiability can say differentiability for me very good different support so differentiability basically basically means the ability to take a derivative at a certain point it is also a great way to explore a whole bunch of point points on Scrabble words with friends it's too long for work so you can't win with that but I send Scrabble now here's the idea in order for a derivative to exist which means it's differentiable at a point this has to work in order for a derivative to exist at a point this must exist in order for a derivative to exist in a point this thing must exist well that should make sense you have to be able to take the derivative right and the derivative of means working out this formula because that is the formula for our derivative true however notice that it's also a minute limits have two limits exist if the limit from the left equals the limit from the right true that's what limits mean limit from the left equals a limit from the right those things go to the same spot but I've talked about continuity right now can we talk about the limits they match up the same spot whether it's defined at that exact spot or not doesn't matter or derivatives sorry for uh for limits it says that Kant has to match up so that must exist here's two implications that we have two implications first one let's say I'm talking about this specific point that we'll call it right now a sharp point it will call a sharp point do you understand that what this limit gives you is actually the slope of a curve true it gives you the slope but for the limit to exist in general the limit from the left has to equal the limit from the right you believe that as well what that means for us in this context is the slope from the left because this this is a slope right that's a slope keep in mind that's a slope it says for this limit to exist for this slope to exist at a point the slope from the left has to equal the slope from the right do you buy into that it's a limit the limits have to be the same but these limits commentate a slope means a slope paestum in that job perhaps what's the slope doing as we're getting to this point that's positive positive positive positive slope right but from the right hand side that's negative negative negative slope are those slopes the same then that limit doesn't exist because the limit from this way and a limit from this way according to our slope doesn't happen the limit of the function yes that does exist the limit of our slope doesn't exist the slopes are not the same remember we're not just taking the limit of the function itself we're taking the limit of the slope do you see the difference I'm not talking about whether the function itself meets the point yes of course the function meets up the limit for the function the function exists does it limit for the slope exists no that would mean the slope from the left is the same as a slope from the right is it that means that at any short point our limit will not exist therefore we can't take a derivative at that point I hope you guys see some blank lows of it are you guys okay or no be sure not really let me show you the difference between limits of slopes and limits of functions themselves this is a function right does the limit of the function exist here absolutely yes the limit of the function exists however does it limit out the slope of the function exists the slope is what we're talking about the slope this way is going here the slope here is a constant are those the same at that point then the limit of the slope doesn't exist that's the difference that we're talking about a derivative is slope not a function self it's the slope of the function so this says the slope is no those don't match up those will make the same exact slope at that point so our two rotations are number one you can't take a derivative at a short point at a short point why f prime of X is a two-sided limit it's a to side limit that gives you slope if the slopes don't match up the limit doesn't exist if the limit is this you can't take the derivative that's the idea the limit up the slope still exists other one is this one you try to try those real careful there we're talking to get at this point at that point do you see how this let's pretend it's barely a function K barely but at one point the slope would be vertical to see that at that one point look what happens to our our slopes remember talking about limit limit has to exist means the limit has some segment right and from the left here we're going to check it out positive Finity right here we're going negative infinity it's positive a negative fitting same thing no no the limit doesn't exist there as well so two implications are you can't take a derivative at a sharp point or where the slope is undefined so this vertical this one this gives at least two to two at least two different slopes for that point this one we run to find repository of infinite your slope is vertical you can't can't take it riveted with that how many okay with our two implications here all right let's see if you if you really understand it one quick example is absolute value X differentiable everywhere what do you think clear I just got a sharp point in fact if you did it with limits of the slope you'd see this the slope is negative one true the slope is positive one as you get to this point the slope is still negative one this one is still positive one right it's negative one equal to positive one then the limit of the slope can't possibly exist this is not continuous everywhere no sorry not differentiable not differentiable everywhere the question also is though could you take the derivative here and here and here here here here here here here here here here all the way up and take you to that point and all except for that line on a point yeah so what we're finding here are just the points where the function is not differentiable everywhere else will be fine so I'll make a little note for you these functions are not differentiable only at those specific points these functions are non-differentiable only at those specific points okay a real quick question a couple more piece information we're almost another section here so nice little peace permission for today firstly we're going to talk about continuity and differentiability and how they have an interplay here first question is I'm talking about this point and this point is this function continuous at Point C is it continuous at Point C fails continuity therefore is it differentiable at Point C now the limit clearly does not exist from both sides if it's not continuous as carefully if a function is not continuous it cannot be differentiable at that point and the function is not continuous it is definitely not differentiable I'm abbreviating your continuous and differentiable okay if it's not continuous it's not there's a long words I'd like to write so it's not continuous it's not differentiable for sure you agree so the next one is this continuous everywhere continuous means you don't pick your pencil off of the papers and continuous is it differentiable everywhere yeah it's not differentiable right there so just because of functions continuous doesn't necessarily mean it is differentiable so that's not that's not always true here's what does mean if the function is differentiable it is definitely continuous differentiability is stronger than continuity business continuous but not differentiable everything is differentiable is automatically continuous so if a function is differentiable it is continuous if a function is differentiable it is continuous for certainly the opposite I've just told you is definitely not true if a function is continuous it does not necessarily mean that it is differentiable I add a point at a point okay we'll end with there we'll talk about any points next time and I'll give you some different representations of how to make the notation for derivatives sit today you okay with it yeah alright is it light so we're talking about how to do these these derivatives and we talk about continuity with that's less than we did write continuity versus differentiability we said if a function is continuous it's not necessarily differentiable that it has to be continuous and have no sharp points and then will be differentiable everywhere if a function is differentiable that certainly means is continuous though for sure so that that differentiability is stronger than continuity they can be continuous without being differentiable but you can't be differentiable without being continuous also if something is not continuous it is certainly not differentiable if they have a jump so it jumps and and I'm sorry sharp points are non differentiable now the last thing in the Italia is that I know I've given you a derivative is typically represented like this that would be the most our introductory derivative we do F prime of X you guys have seen a lot of that before right most of the time we write that however there's also some other things that we can write we'll also write to find that the derivative this DDX if you've seen that in your book that's what that stands for so DDX says I want you to differentiate the function with respect to X basically you can think of it that way so this says find the derivative or differentiate whatever function I give you with respect to that variable a derivative with respect to X of f of X it means the same thing is doing that alright same exact K okay with that one as well you can also represent it Y if you had a function y you can write read Y Prime so Y prime would also be a derivative or you can write for function y dydx so this would be a derivative of Y with respect to X same basic notation is this so we have a function notation and we have like our Y notation we have F prime of X or Y Prime we have DF DX or the DDX of f of X or F dy/dx they all mean a derivative and then the change or basically yeah you probably stick with one version for a problem so if I ask you find DDX you'll stick with D DX just a find f prime you'll just use that Prime but you need to know that when you see it it's not something confusing it's just a derivative there you okay on and so forth also we can evaluate derivatives at points we've done this to find the slope of a curve at a point you plug in numbers right and they can tell you to evaluate derivatives at certain points how that will be shown is this if you wanted to to find the slope of the derivative at a certain point it would be show like that shown like that find F prime of a where a is like three or negative two or you just plug in a number that's how that would tell you I want you to evaluate the first derivative at that specific point this one's a little different it would say I want you to evaluate the first at a specific point but they do it like this they go put this long vertical line and then put x equals a I know it looks a little weird right but it just says I want you to evaluate this is not what I'm making it long so you see this longer than normal it doesn't have to be that I'm certainly multiply right but this just says evaluate your first derivative at x equals a it's same exact thing as this they mean leave these only the same thing you could do this y prime of a or lastly you can do dy DX at x equals a just this long line just means evaluated how we will feel okay with our symbology our notation for this so this is our evaluation this is just the way we can represent our first group did and that pretty much wraps up section 2.1 that's it so if we get this step down as far as the continuity goes and find the derivatives we're good you have any questions before we move on right well I've done for you all of the theory stuff behind derivatives I've worked them out for you I've showed you how to get them I went from finding the slope to taking the limit of that slope and moving the point really close to that to another point saying this is a tangent line so we're at a point we've done velocities and rates of change right now we're going to work on techniques of differentiation how to find the derivative of any function whatsoever that we're going to start working on that stuff are you ready for it trust me you're ready for it you're right if you can take the derivative you're ready for it can't take a derivative you're ready for it do you want to do it I don't know we're ready 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 2.2:  Techniques of Differentiation (Finding Derivatives of Functions Easily)
techniques of differentiation we're going to start off nice and simple I want to talk about the derivative of any horizontal line for I have to start there and then we'll move on from that okay so what happens if I try to find the slope of a constant so for instance uh slope of a constant when you graph a constant what do you get do you get a horizontal or a vertical line which one if you graph a constant y equals 5 what do you get it's not vertical right that would be x equals a horizontal line at whatever your constant happens to be so that's a constant line tell me something supposing I've drawn this perfectly what's the slope of my line there sure because we know the slope of any horizontal line would be zero right so and the slope of a constant is in fact Zer it's not rising or falling all right cool uh well wait a second though what does d deriv stand for SL curve in our case our curve is a horizontal line it's still considered a curve even though ironically it doesn't C all right uh still though if derivative means slope you believe me that derivative means slope right if derivative means slope of a function and the slope of our function is always zero no matter what then the derivative of a constant I've been completely General about this constant I don't know what it is could be negative positive whatever what's the derivative of a constant basically it's asking this question don't forget what a derivative means der mean slope what's the slope of a constant line zero zero sure what's the slope of a horizontal line zero the derivative of any constant is zero no matter what that's kind of nice do you believe that do you buy into the reasoning why horizontal lines have no slope right or they have a slope of zero I should say they have a slope of zero therefore the derivative of a horizontal line must give you zero derivative is slope slope horizontal lines are zero uh constants give you horizontal line so the derivative of the constant is zero that's kind of nice so in English this says the derivative of a constant is zero okay basic examples just to make sure that you get it uh right okay we'll get there in a minute what's the derivative of what's the derivative of three three is a constant what's the derivative of a constant no work at all that's fantastic I love no more limit right if you have a constant the derivative is is just zero that's that's easier what's the derivative of derivative of Nea 1 everybody what is that no thought at all derivative of constant is zero what's a derivative of Pi is Pi a constant Pi is just a number it is 3.14159 and forever whatever that is but it doesn't matter that it doesn't end it's still a constant number isn't it doesn't change the derivative of any Conant is zero so this is zero how people feel okay with the derivative of a constant is zero good that's kind of nice right we we didn't even have to use limits over there unfortunately for us when we come up with something that does have a variable in it there was a formula that we were able to use we knew that the first derivative or I'll use just so you get familiar with it the derivative of f with respect to X that's what that is was what what did it start with the formula if to find a derivative oh before that limit limit need a limit love it okay that's how you find the derivative true we we've practiced a lot of time on this this will one of the examples we got to do is this one I want you to see what happens with this okay so we're going to work this through right now I've asked you to find f plus h I'm sorry uh f of x plus h first and f of x find them independently then we plug them in and we figure out what this is is going to be what is f of x plus h what's that going to give us in this case very good it's just a composition we're just substituting that in have you gotten pretty good at that so far just don't separate X Plus H you'll be fine f ofx is just X cubed so we know our first derivative is going to be limit H goes to Zer x + HB - x Cub all over H still all right so far what do I do now yeah we gone through this a lot now it's basically just alge you distribute you combine some like terms hopefully you're able to factor an H out and your whole goal here is to cross H's out true that's your whole whole goal so in our case we'd go all right well this is limit H goes to zero we've got X Cub + 3x^2 H + 3x h^ 2us I'm sorry plus h Cub - x Cub I did that kind of fast but you would just distribute that all out x + H * x + H * x + H distribute combined like terms and I guarantee that's what you're going to get right there if you want to learn a quicker way to do that you come and see me I'll show you Pascal's triangle and how to do binomial expansion it's not hard so far so good does everything except for the h terms cross out in that case that's just this one and this one so we get limit H goes to zero 3x^2 H + 3x h^2 + H Cub over H what would I do now to finish off this problem perfect you're still with me right we done work like this before just some some algebra cross the H's out uh let the H go to zero because now you've gotten rid of that denominator and what are you going to get out of this whole beautiful thing 3x2 right beautiful what did I just find formula of the slope yeah so this gives the slope of this function this S curve at any point right if I had to give you a point like uh 1 one or I give you a point like 28 you could plug in the two or the the x value you could evaluate it find me the actual slope and find me the equation tangent line of that specific point could you not I hope you're like yes I can do that right now that that's where you should be at this point here's the thing this is going to be from someone who hasn't taken calculus before I want an answer do you see because I know some of you have so those of you don't love me that much but those of you who have not had calculus before you're going to love me you're love me does this suck yes this sucks I want you to think is there a way that you can go from here to Here Without garbage do you see a pattern do you see the pattern on someone who hasn't had the calculus before some where's this where's this number go coefficient what happens to this number Dr by one so from this to this all that happened was this number went out into the front right and one got taken away from that number you believe me guess what works all the time all the time do you ever have to do this again that been useful why do you think I teach you this one before I teach you this one cuz you would ever do this yeah you don't have to this is the the formula for derivative what we're going to learn now are shortcuts this hor is there even a formula when you can just do that because this is what we're doing this is the slope and this is the only way that you can let this the points the distance between them go to zero this is it this right here is a shortcut that works every time that so what's the actual calculus this is the actual calculus that's it right this is the stuff that works the limit is the fundamental of the of the calculus that's how you let it happen now techniques of differentiation says great we understand that what's the way we can put this in practice and actually do the derivatives all the time this stuff right because here's the thing you going to want to do that that has to be a 30 you want to do that no no I don't either cuz but the the thing that's going to happen is it's a polinomial right it's a very basic polinomial and what's going to happen is if you do by expansion every single term in here think about this you can think about it every term in here is going to have an H except for the very first one true the very first one is not and you're subtracting exactly that function from it so that's going to be gone everything else has an H the very next term will have only a single H that's binomial expansion when you factor that H out it you'll be only left with this thing binomial expansion says how you get this is that goes there and that becomes one less that's why this works that is the the power rule for derivatives so what's calculus this is calculus what's the easy way to do it that's the easy way to do it you have to know this because that's what we're what this class is all about all right you're finding slopes and that's how you do it in practical application though you just kind of cheat a little bit you ready to learn how to cheat yes that's what I love calcul I love cheating it's not cheating everyone does this if everyone does it it makes it okay that's not true by really really so if everybody jumps off the bridge please do it we have a shortage of food I mean it would I'm just kidding you on on YouTube or where don't jump off Bridges that's sarcasm hurts sometimes it does you just hope that sarcasm inves you okay if n is in integer this works we're going to find it later there's no qualifications on end it can be anything but for right now any integer works for us this is a true statement the derivative of Any X to any power is equal to notice DDX stands for derivative that's how I'm going to be writing most derivatives in here because it's very nice notationally to to write it this way uh it's hard to write it with the F Prime to to do this um I I don't like that I like this way to say I'm taking the derivative of whatever's in there do you understand it says take the derivative of this what you get out of that is what happens to the the well it wasn't a 30 anymore was was three what happens to the three what's is a symbol that represents the three here what's the N going to do you just pull that n up front the X doesn't change but what happens to the variable sure you subtract one from it that's n minus one [Music] do you love me told you you love me maybe not not yet you're going to so can you do we've actually done that G and before if you remember we've done it twice we've done it the Long Way both of limits can you do that derivative what's the derivative of x that's what this question asks derivative of X2 what do you do what happens to the two again it fits this format so two goes here x to the how much one because you're going to do 2 minus one now I'm rarely going to show you that math we're just going to assume you can subtract one on your own and get 2x to the first Power just 2x hey that's kind of cool cuz you've just found the slope of that curve in less than two seconds without doing any limits or anything like that right so I could actually this question and now the same exact question I gave you on your test and you could do it in like a minute maybe less because I say find me the equation of the tangent line through this curve at the point 2 comma 4 can you do it yeah at 2 comma four here's your slope right plug in two you get a slope of four now you have a point and you have a slope it's very quick very very nice so on the test are you ever going to tell us to do that yeah probably once to make sure you can do it yeah but after that no it takes way too long especially for for things like this I mean honestly that's just ridiculous even though it's very simple that's ridiculous when it comes to this stuff you don't want to expand that you don't want to do that I'm guessing a whole lot of you are probably not going to come to me for binomial expansion anymore since we don't have to do those for crazy big numbers can you take the derivative of x to the 5th how much is it to the good we bring down the five x to the subtract one from that exponent you get 2 4th power that's the derivative very nice very quick if you did it this way would it work out yes absolutely just going to take you a whole long time here's one you definitely don't want to do DDS of s 15th notice one thing on the notation do you know notice how this has to change with the variable that I have so it's not DDX anymore it's DDS derivative with respect to S and then I'll give you the variable so s to 15 uh what's this one sure very quick very very fast now there are a couple things that we we should be able to do as well what would happen if I gave you did the shiny just wear off a calculus did it make it less cool somehow that it's easier or did it make it like is so not bad it's going to get worse I mean it's it's going to get worse this is the com before the storm yeah this is like the eye of the hurricane all right you made it through the outskirts and now you're like ah it's sunny I like this little Mist maybe to cool you off and then I'll pound you again later but for right now take a breath can you do with negatives yeah of course yes absolutely you can what do you do with the the negative what's it what's it going to become what's the derivative of x to the by the way this is showing work all right you don't have to show me any more work than this what's the derivative of x to the -3rd what happens to the3 so you still have to do that3 x to the wait wait not -2 -3 minus 1 yeah that's -4 so this is -3 x^4 you be surprised how many people mess that up all right watch your signs very carefully if you're subtracting make sure you actually are subtracting um we'll do do we do a couple more how about this do you want us to write it like that or move the exponent to the denominator oh you can do this as well generally generally I'll tell you if I've given it to you this way leave it this way that's fine if I've given it to you as the other way give it to me the other way okay that's the general rule if you want to write like this all the time that's fine as well how about that one what's that going to be -2 comes down great P to the what okay you know what I'm going to move this one over there so you see it better this is kind of an important one actually what about DDX 1X is it 1X uh sorry 1 what do you do with that is it one over one you just take the derivative of x can you do that move Theon in front of X which is one up to the top so we have to move this so that it fits that format you with me right now it doesn't so somehow you got to change it to make it fit that if we do that sure now it becomes a NE 1 now you can take the derivative because it fits our X to n format we'll bring down the1 x to the what two or -2 you're subtracting one from it -2 and then because I gave it this way change it back we're going to have -1 over x^2 that's the derivative you okay with this so far by the way what's the derivative of just X One some people said X some people said one one what's the exponent right now it is one right so what would happen here is You' bring down the one you'd have x to the 1 - one wouldn't you what's x to the 1 - one Z so you'd have one * x to the 0 what's x to the 0 so this is 1 * 1 or 1 the derivative of x is one in fact if you think about this think think for a second understand that's the most basic of all linear equations yes what what where we have a non horizontal it's x to the first Power what's the slope of this line derivative means slope doesn't it so the Der would also be one that's you can show it with the general power rule now how do you'll feel okay with so far all right another little thing we can do it's kind of cool this opens up a whole lot of doors for us so another note if you ever have a constant times a function that could be anything in there what we can do with derivatives is take that constant and move it out in front of our derivative it doesn't apply to it so this is the same thing as C * the derivative of FX if C is a constant so for make sure you know that c is a constant number it doesn't change as like 3 or -2 or Pi but if we haven't being multiplied by that function we can pull outside I can see a couple examples of this how about a derivative of 5x to the 4th power do I have a constant in there being multiplied by a function yeah 5 is be multiplied X to 4th remember we we kind of want to make it fit that thing right because that's that's the only thing we know right now so that's about it so you know you can make this five times the derivative of X to 4 we can take that constant number and multiply it by the the derivative of the function itself so what's the derivative of x to the 4th power please don't forget about the five but then you have 4X sure 2 the thir power now you can do the five * the four how much you going to get3 yeah sure now look practically can you get 20x 3r from here yeah absolutely you bring down the four you multiply it times the five you're going to get the 20 right are you following me on that I haven't out outpaced you yet all right cool if you bring down the four which you know you're going to be doing multiply it by the constant term you're going to get the 20 and then subtract one from the four you're still going to get 20 x to the 3 power how about the derivative ofx to the 7th power what do you think what can we do do we have a constant in there yes so we could pull that constant out that negative then take the derivative of x 7th can you take the derivative of x 7th all of you should be able to at this point right so we could do that but basically I'm showing this to let you know that if we can pull the constant outside of it you can just multiply it by the exponent so in our case right here can you tell me the answer with just doing negative this the derivative ofx to 7th what are we going to get sure you know that's a constant you'll be multiplying it later1 that's ative 1 * POS 7 is -7 x to 6 power you're done that's your derivative there how about let's do one L one the derivative of pi/ x^2 Pi x^2 what do you think is it pi over 2x pi over 2x can you do that can you do pi over 2x that doesn't fit right that doesn't fit the the power rule that I gave you just a minute ago it doesn't fit that what would you have to do to the x s before you can do that stuff just what you did here same thing you did that you got to make it this format otherwise you can't touch it so right here we got to say all right well I know that this is the same thing as DDX pix to the2 are you with me on that or no move your negative move your exponents up make them negative that way you can use that power rule that I showed you otherwise you can't do it this in no way is equal to 2x you can't just can't do that now what what's next what do you think P out we could pull out the pi if you wanted to or you could leave it in there if you wanted to it doesn't really matter if you pull out the pi you'll have Pi * DDX of x -2 now can you take the derivative of x to the -2 yeah now it fits right now you can do it you can pull down the -2 take one away from the that exponent you're going to get the -2X to -3 and then multiply by the pi by the way stop for a second you know how I told you the derivative of a constant is always zero a lot of people ask later well wait wait a second if the derivative of a constant is always zero why don't we get a zero here why don't we do that well that's actually connected to something with a variable right if you have a constant by itself like the derivative of Pi that was Zero however because we have a a constant being connected to that that variable we can pull that outside by multiplication so basically just hangs around and says no it's not zero uh I will show you that yes a derivative of the constant it is zero uh but if you did that you'd have to show something called the product rule here I'll talk about that in the next section but for right now you go okay well wait a derivative of a constant by itself yes zero as soon as you connect it to a variable that now is just a constant being multiplied by that variable you can pull it out front you can use that rule that I showed you then take the derivative of the function and multiply it back does that make sense otherwise all of your derivatives would end up being zero and that would say the slope of everything is zero that's not true so here you have the pi time well you all told me it was -2 x to -3 we bring it down we subtract one and if you really wanted to kind of pretty this thing up a little bit you'd make it -2 piun overx Cub you see how to get to the -2 pix Cub Nodge your head if you can feel right okay and that's our der could You' have got there directly from from here sure sure you bring down that -2 that's the -2 * 5 x to3 you can do that by the way a couple nice little little rules for us just like we could do with limits you see when we're finding derivatives we're actually finding limits right with limits you can pull constants out with limits you can separate by addition and subtraction true do the same thing here if you have the derivative of a couple functions being added or subtracted that's the same thing as a derivative of the first function plus or minus use in subtraction the derivative of the second function you ready to see how we can apply this to some problems okay now now check this out by the way this should be like a booya MO for you like yes oh I got this no more limits bam done cuz if you had to do oh my gosh if you had to do this problem with limits see y'all next week I'll go home for for four days and you can just work on that well it would take you a week but it'd be pretty difficult wouldn't it because remember what you'd have to do to find the derivative you'd have X Plus H and X plus h in here and subtract that whole thing you'd have to find some common denominators because you have this uh this negative exponent you have some pretty nasty work to do on this thing very nasty work however using what we now know about derivatives if we can break all this stuff up into individual functions being added or subtracted take the derivative of each one and put them back together we're good to go I mean that's not bad at all so can I separate these two things yes okay let's go slowly through this I really want you to get this yeah you can you can separate addition subtraction so this is the same thing as the derivative of 3x 9th minus the derivative of x to3 are you okay on that step tell me one thing you could do with this is that legal to do can you pull the constant out yes we could do that the constant doesn't become a zero it's connected by that variable could you just take the derivative the way it is okay let's let's try that what's the derivative of 3x to the 9th everybody what is it 2 good bring it down you're multiplying that 3 * 9 gives you the 27 x to the 8 sure we're subtracting one from the exponent then I have my minus sign what's the derivative of this one okay it's going to be ultimately yes you're right but since I have this minus sign right here what's the derivative of just that piece x what good I'm subtracting one remember that's in parenthesis because I'm subtracting that whole derivative there minus a negative becomes a is that look okay to you hey quick question could you get their direct ly from here M sure what's the Dera of 3x 9th it is 27 x 8us the derivative of 3x to the -3 * a negative gives you a POS 3 x to4 can you get that on your own as well sure you can what I'm letting you do here is I'm I'm showing you sure you can do this it's legal therefore what that allows you to do in your Calculus is take derivatives term by term that's what allows you to do so do you need to split this up for me no no you're not going to do that what you're going to do is look at this go okay Mr Leonard said by this this rule split up by addition subtraction that I can split them up that means I can take derivatives term by term since I could pull the constant out that means I'm just multiplying it so do I need to show that no you don't it's just saying it's legal to do that means that when I look at this I go okay I know that constant's going to end up being multiplied by the derivative of x 9th the derivative of x 9th is 9x 8 when I mul the 3 * 9 that's how I'm getting the 27 this says okay minus but I'm going to have a negative there or if you consider this as one term-1 * -3 that's going to give you the posi3 then the that x^ the4 comes in the fact that I can take this derivative by itself term by term how many people feel okay with our example so far good okay cool would you like to see one more how about two more sure we'll do uh we'll do two more I'll show you an application of it uh we'll talk about higher order derivatives and that'll be our day I know higher order derivativ sound much worse but they're not they're you'll like them promise I'm going a little bit beyond this section for re I want to show you that this work this is actually true have we fit our format yet have we fit that no what's wrong square roots are problemss square roots are problems because they don't have a exponent can you make them have an exponent yes what is the exponent power over root it's always power over root so the root is two the power is one that means X to the 1/2 power so if this becomes a derivative with respect to the variable x 4 - 3 x^ 12 this is a last time I'll show you how to break it up you could break this up as a derivative of four minus the D minus well I'll even do this for you 3 times the derivative of x to the2 do you see how that's legal to split that up we can split it by subtraction we can move constant out in front of it this is a very easy derivative derivative to take what's the derivative of a constant number notice the difference here this is not connected by a variable right this is just the derivative of the constant itself I pull that out even if I were to do this and say well wait a second Mr lar did you say I could pull the constant out in front didn't I tell you that you still have a one in there right what's the derivative of one one's still a constant four time 0 is still zero right the variable affects your problem that's what it does derivative of a constant gives you just zero so this is zero don't forget that's a minus notice that are you okay by the way getting from here to here separating them and pulling the three out at the same time you'd have that three times let's do the derivative of a fractional exponent it works exactly the same way as any other power rule so can you bring down the 1/2 so bring that down first 12 x to x to the O can you subtract one from 12a 1/2 yeah2 minus one so our derivative is -3 X 12 fun could you maybe get that directly from here could you get that what happens to the four zero because it's being it's four minus something with a variable so that's a constant term all by itself the derivative of a constant term all by itself is zero yes minus oh that's our negative 12 * 3 is 3 x^ 1/2 - 1 is - 1/2 can you make it a little prettier mhm if you make it a little prettier here's how it look the3 would be on your numerator your denominator would have a two from that this negative exponent would go down to the denominator and it's also a square root that's how that thing would look negative exponent bottom 12 square root show hands tell me if you okay with what we talked about so far you can do this with any polinomial anything with a an integer in it or and now you know fractional exponents you can do this for pretty much darn near anything it's broken up into terms so that means when you get a problem that looks like this and I say okay 5 x 7th - 3x 4th 2x Cub + x - 1 notice the notation I'm going to use here if I say find dydx and my notation might change for the type of function I have this is defined as y equals so I have find the derivative of y with respect to its variable of x that's what that says in English okay can you find the D to that could you have done it with limits yes you could have would it have taken you probably a weekend yeah yeah you'd hate me you maybe somebody hated me on some of your homework you were doing oh I don't like you Mr Leonard but now you love me right forgiven almost almost forgiven can you take the derivative real quick yeah sure take it term by term do you need to split it up no I've showing you rules to say that you can split it up which means you can take a derivative term by term through addition subtraction do it now the next question asks one of the fundamental principles of calculus one of them and it's it's so far as far as applications go if you can answer that question you're going to have a good foothold about the the ideas of calculus so first you make sure you can actually find a derivative here I look at this I'd say okay I bring down my exponent I'm going to have by the way dydx it says the derivative of y with respect to X is and then you put your derivative 35 x to 6 did you get that then I'm going to get -2 x 3r yes then I'm going to get + 6 x squ don't forget about the squ don't forget the exponents can't you can't lose those uh oh how about the X why one because because I said so because Mr said well you can do it by this this you can do it by the rule or you can think that is just a linear function right Dera of linear function has to be the constant term which is in front of it which happens to be a one in this case that's going to be one if that had been 3x that would be a three what happens to the one this one that's a constant that's gone out of your problem how made it that far yes no yes good all right cool now the next one asks this can you can you take this idea and apply it at what points does y = x - 3x + 4 have horizontal tangent lines tell me something about a line that is horizontal what do you know about a line that is horizontal slope is how much okay the slope is zero you're all right horizontal tangent lines have slopes that are zero you follow what will give you the slope we know derivative means slope right so the idea is can you find the derivative and see where equals zero because if you can find the derivative and see where equals z you will have the points at which you have horizontal tangent lines this you you will find out uh that we're going to use this in graphing for find out the points of relative Max and relative men you ever heard of those things before we'll be able to do that very quickly we'll be able to optimize uh word problems maximization minimization cost functions all sorts of things with this idea find a derivative set equal to zero that's going to give you the points that you get a horizontal tangent we're going to talk about this next time all right so one question that we can conquer according with our our derivatives and the idea that a derivative is a what's a derivative again good glad you're awake today for Tuesday congratulations that's awesome uh we can conquer the idea of can we find out where functions will have horizontal tangent lines firstly what do you know about a line that is horizontal something about its slope slope would be zero for a horizontal line true so we were trying to look for lines that are horizontal to our original function how do you find the slope of the original function a derivative would give you slope yeah absolutely so if we found the derivative of our original function and we found out where that was equal to a slope of zero then we're going to be able to find the points where we have a horizontal tangent line here's how you would do that number one take your derivative of your function go ahead and do that now so do dydx or Y Prime if you'd like take your derivative come on we got this last time take your derivative derivatives now should be oh man this should be really quick shoot if we had to do the limit for this derivative that' take forever right it wouldn't be that great but now we can do it in literally like 5 Seconds like literally 5 Seconds crazy uh what's the derivative for y = XB - 3x + 4 what is that great because I told you you can take it term by term 3x^2 absolutely minus how much what happens to the four that's a constant Dera constants gives you zero if it's not attached to a variable did you get 3x^2 minus 3 okay what does this give you again formula for SL so this right here is your slope of that curve that's the slope of that curve what I want to know is where this curve has tangent lines which are horizontal what we found out earlier is that the slope of the tangent line is the slope of the curve at the point does that make sense so if this is the slope of the curve at any point and we want that slope to be zero can you set that equal to zero so if you set this the idea is we want it to be horizontal right horizontal means a slope of zero so basically we want a slope a slope of zero zero means horizontal can you do that for any slope you were looking for say if you want the slope where equals two absolutely so if I want a slope of one i' have it equal to one probably be harder to solve in this particular case but you can do it yeah this is a formula for slope so set it equal to whatever we want now the idea is we're typically going to pick horizontal because interesting things happen when you have a slope equal to zero that that that really does haveen inter some things for instance this at this point up at the top notice positive slope positive slope positive slope negative slope negative slope negative slope do you see that therefore at the top it has to have a slope of zero that would be a change from increase and to decrease and that would give you a relative maximum sometimes an absolute maximum of your function so interesting things happen there curves are optimized normally when you have some sort of a slope equal to zero so this is going to be the most common question I'm going to ask of you as far as relate the slope to some number it's typically typically going to be zero you follow the idea now can you solve that hey that's just some basic algebra so if we solved it how might you solve it you could you could do factor three difference of squares you're going to get one and negative 1 do you see it or if you added three divided by three and took a square root you'd still have one and negative 1 do you see it either way so either way because when you take a square root you have plus and minus I have like the factoring version sure we get x^2 - 1 = 0 that's 3 x + 1 x -1 x + 1 = 0 x - 1 = 0 therefore x = 1 x = POS 1 hey do something for me real quick just verify this for your own edification here for your own knowledge uh take those plug it into that take these and plug it into that and see what you get okay just so you see what happens here take a ne1 and plug it in how much do you get you get zero take one and plug it in how much you get so would you agree that these are the points where your slope is going to equal zero these are the points where you're going to have a horizontal tangent these are the actually not the points I misspoke these are the X values can you now find the points at which you will have a horizontal tangent the points these are your X values how do you find points to this one no that gives you slopes that would give you points so the points would be at all right well let's see here if x = -1 and x = 1 if I plug in -1 and I plug in one these two points will have horizontal tangent lines plug in 1 how much do you get out of that six okay plug in positive one how much do you get out of that those right there are the two points where you will have horizontal tangent lines nowhere else that's it I can say for certain nowhere else because we have found the function for the slope we said equal to zero and we solved it and these are the only two points that existed that's it how many people understood the idea of a horizontal tangent it's kind of interesting right cool you know last thing in our section really is we can also talk about higher derivatives we've been taking first derivatives this whole time which means you take the derivative of the function and that's it right now we're going to I'm going to tell you that you can take a second derivative and a third derivative and as many as you want to take so we're going to look at higher derivatives I do need to tell you the notation though how we say how we write out a first and a second and a third and a fourth so here's a first derivative second derivative we'll talk about a third and you can go further and further and further however many want derivatives you want to take our notation for a first derivative was typically this frime of X you remember that one right or we'd have uh y Prime you can write y prime or dydx those are the main three we stick with those normally actually in this class we'll be sticking with this one and that one typically is where we where we like to go you with that so far that should be like old school stuff well not old school it's all new for you but like from uh the previous section so we have that second derivatives say this you take your first derivative then you take a derivative of that so for instance could you take a derivative of this yeah it'd be pretty easy you'd get how much you get 6X very good that would be called a second derivative second derivatives are notated this way so this is the frime of x you'd say F double Prime of x if I took another derivative I'd have F triple prime of X and you just keep on writing little Dash marks uh some people i' I've seen put a little four up there for fourth derivative we rarely get to a fourth derivative but you could uh but you keep on writing those little Dash marks this is called the the Newtonian method of of writing um derivatives that you see there was these two guys uh Isaac Newton and Sir Godfrey libes who invented calculus about the same time one of them was English I think Newton was English wasn't he and then uh libes was German and of course back then the nations want to say well we invented calculus this is ours and so they kind of stuck with their own notation and and uh this this right here is the Newton's way of doing it he used little dots and this is the libid way of doing it and we still have that notation to this day so this comes from the the German guy and this comes from the English guy uh how they notated it and we still use that and each of them have their advantages um this one I'll show you some advantages to this later on why it's kind of nice why I do it this way uh first because my German Heritage you know but no I'm just kidding uh because we actually can do some pretty cool things with this type of notation I'll show you that especially when we get to like differential equations things like that all right um now y Prime you'd still stick with the Y double Prime y triple prime and so on uh the dydx does this a little bit different it says okay this is a first derivative of y with respect to X okay one time this says take a second derivative of y with respect to X both times that's how I think of it so you have a little two saying that's a second derivative this is a third derivative with respect to X every time so we keep on putting on another number that's a little bit more concise than those those little Dash marks I like that a little bit better looks better you can see it more that way also if you're going through and you just oh lost one well that would suck right because you don't know but it's hard to screw up a two and a three well maybe not maybe not that hard but harder than messing up a dash Mark are you guys okay with the the derivative notation first second third what I'd like to do now just for fun can you find all of the higher derivatives of this can you find all the higher derivatives there so start with the first derivative find the first derivative then find the second one then the third one then the fourth one then the fifth one then the sixth one and see what happens okay I want you keep going did you find him are you still working on it you still working on it keep going if not well let's start up here first derivative can you please tell me what the first derivative is on this 20 x Cub you got that one right okay then I I heard 27 X2 yes - 10 x what I do oh 27 I actually cubed it my bad I was on this one shoot I guess 3 * 3 is n that's that's good to know yeah uh and lastly what else do we have yeah my bad what happens with 347 what here's what's interesting too what if I did made this 34755 would this derivative change no so that constant really has no effect on your derivative we're talking about the slope right so all this is is really a shift upward or downward so if we're just shifting the whole function up or down doesn't affect the slope of the function say oh now it's way up here now it's way down here so that really doesn't affect it which is interesting okay uh next up second derivative we just take the derivative again so we're going to do what's 28 * 3 what x^2 minus 18x you got that one right minus 10 what happens to the N9 it's a constant it goes away now what okay then we take the derivative again and yeah we're going to get 168 and again that that constant goes away 168 well let's do the fifth derivative what's theth what's the derivative of 168 what's the sixth derivative what's the seventh derivative what's every derivative after that this is going to happen for every polom you see at some point no matter what you start with if it's a polom you'll be able to take a derivative and what happens every time is the the the order of the polinomial decreases by one so 4 3 2 1 0 and then a constant that's going to happen with pols now does it happen all the time think about something that's not a polinomial I'll give you an example if you need one how about that it's going toas well decreasing because we subtract one but it becomes more and more and more negative right this derivative would the derivative of that would give you -2 x^ the3 right then you get POS 6 x^4 and then so on and so on and so on and so and so that actually that that exponent keeps on getting small more and more and more negative so this won't cycle out to zero eventually it's not a polinomial so be careful on it you're not always going to go to zero but you can find more more and more derivatives on this how people feel okay with our higher order derivatives so it's basically just take a derivative and then take it again and again and again that's what this is asking you to do so where would we be the correct place to stop at 168 or when it reaches zero zero this is all the higher derivatives because every other derivative is going to be zero so zero counts as a derivative absolutely yeah this we've taken one 2 3 4 but then you can take this again and get something different right you could get five but then as soon as you take it six it's not doing you can take them as many times as you want you're just going to get the trivial answer answer of zero after that yes what if it was 1x2 that is 1x2 when you get to zero no no uh the derivative of this is in no way 1/ 2x at all you're breaking the rules here there's only one rule that we have the one rule that we have is is it must fit this format folks it must fit this format if it doesn't fit that format you can't do it that's it you need to be able to break it down in such a way that it does fit this format all we can do is separate by addition subtraction and pull out constants so in order to make it fit this format we can't just say oh derivative of X2 is 2x that would be awesome but no it doesn't work that way instead you have to say oh this is the derivative of x to the two that fits that format do you see the difference there you have to make it fit that so you have to pull that negative that exponent up and make it a negative that way you can work with your power rule does that clarify your question okay so we can't just take derivatives of parts of like quotients can't take it at parts of products we're going to talk about those things in just a little while but you can't just do that you with me on this I see one more example might be good for you guys to see this one could you take the derivative of all those things okay could you take the derivative of this thing go your head yes you can yes you can can you take a derivative Al together no not the way it is right now let me show you a couple things about this problem number one well you probably are going to want to make this x 5 - 2x - 3 all over 3 X to the2 do you see what we did there you okay with that that's okay that's great that's fine but here's what you cannot do this is going to go back to your previous problem what you can't do folks you can't do this I I wish you could but you can't you can't go oh you know what this is 5 x 4 - 2x over 3 x to the 1 half do you see what I did I took derivative derivative derivative derivative can you do that no no you can't they're they're connected they're and they're in a quo we're going to find out later you can't do that you can't do that one if you want to write that down cross it out if you wrote it down cross it out you can't just take it piece by piece if they're connected you have to be able to separate them completely and take a derivative uh by term by term you can't do that here you see you can't separate this and have its own derivative minus its own derivative minus its own derivative and then have it over another derivative that's something we can't do we can't do that so what we would have to oh give another option what could I do whenever I have some expression over one single term what could I do I can't move that up I don't want to do that what can I do when I whenever I have one uh several expression several terms over one single Factor SPL up what no split it up over the let's split it up so sometimes these these daunting looking uh derivatives that you need to do what would happen if I did split this up as X 5th over this - 2x over this 3 over that let's see what happens there then maybe we'll make it fit into our our scenario that we can work with firstly are you okay that this doesn't work as a matter of fact you can't just take all these pieces if we have a quotient or a product or something crazy the only time we ever found out that that did work was this look when I had a polinomial yes that works cuz I can separate by addition subtraction that's what makes that work I didn't tell you you can separate by division because you can't I didn't tell you you can separate by multiplication because you can't unless you have the constant that comes out it's only that's the only thing so you can't separate by division you can't do that only thing you can separate is addition subtraction you follow me on this so when I when I translate this into 3x^ the2 we got have something better than this this this over that work well we could do is potentially split these up into three different fractions so for instance why don't we try to make it X 5th over 3x/ 12us 2 X over 3x2 - 3 over 3x2 and then we'll try to simplify each of those fractions to make them fit in our power rule and then take the derivative are you guys all right with what we're doing so far we're trying to make it fit into this we have to make it fit there if we can't make it fit there we can't take the derivative right now can you combine those X to 5th and x to the 1/2 how you combine those okay what happens when you have common bases that are being divided do you add exponents subtract exponents multiply exponents or divide exponents let me let me break it down even easier for you okay watch no just watch can you simplify that yeah please goodness say yes please say yes Mr Leonard I know how I'm I'm supposed to be in this class yay how do you simplify this what is it what is it you subtract what subract your exponents because when you divide exponents you have four of them here you have three of them there you cross out three of them you have one of them left right that's subtracting exponents you go oh yes this is completely gone that becomes an X what happens to the two go on top stay on the bottom so you would have X over 2 true or you could get 12 x do you follow okay so you know whenever you have common bases you subtract exponents this is not a hard concept you've seen this since your algebra beginning algebra days beginning algebra days so can you combine these the answer is what how do you combine those how how' you combine those subtract what subtract your exponents what's five minus a half how much you going to get four and a half give it to me as improper fraction N9 nine halves really all right I Didn't Do It In My Head yeah n half I need you to be able to get there that's not calculus okay that's algebra this right here I mean people have said before you take calculus to finally fail algebra don't let that be you know your algebra if you know your algebra this is a piece of cake I mean really honestly calculus is easy if you know your algebra promise and trigonometry if you don't yeah it's going to hold you back a lot uh are you okay on firstly going from here to here secondly going from here to in them up and now thirdly do you see how to get from the X 5th over x/2 into 1/3 x 9s we subtracting those two exponents do that in calculate if you want to 5us half you're can get four and a half or N9 halfes minus let's look at those numbers that's going to give me 2/3 x over X to 1/2 gives you what please 122 good because you subtract 1 -2 and get X to2 minus oh what's that become this is supposed to be a new video you have that old school ringtone on come on man give me some 50 Cent or that's even old too what's new uh I'm on the edge of glory give me that one next time okay all right thanks what happens to the threes they become a one what happens to the X to the 1/2 what are you going to have to do with that in order to make it fit that what do you do can you leave it like this and take a derivative no that would be the scenario that would be that scenario what do you have to do to that one2 so we're going to have to move that to the numerator and make it a negative one2 do you follow me you're constantly trying to make it just look like that that's what you need so 1/ X2 no X to the2 yes yes show hands how people feel okay with this so far simple algebra good all right simp you passed simple algebra very good hey now that why this is still why I haven't even done do you notice I haven't even done calculus yet no calculus yet this is basic this is algebra now can you do the calculus can you take a derivative why don't you carefully right now take me that derivative go and do that carefully take derivative I'd rather have the go slowly on it by the way I I want the correct answer slowly rather than the wrong answer quickly that would be stupid was that lady goooo by the way that lady yeah is that not right perfect so Dy DX or Y Prime if you'd like note how each of these now fits into our format here the constants we could pull them out we're just taking a derivative of x to 9 derivative of X2 of x 12 let's do that piece by piece I'm going to show you every step okay right now so you see where it's coming from I'll have the 1/3 times the 9 halves you see where the 9 halves is coming from ladies and gentlemen okay I'm going to have x to the I need to do 9 halves minus 1 that's going to give me seven halves did you get seven halves as well perfect seven halves get one next up I'm going to have minus minus 2/3 2/3 times what folks okay what2 because that's my exponent that I'm bringing down so I leave my constant alone I'm multiplying by my exponent and then I'm going to take x to the 12 minus one gives you what lastly I have minus minus what now okay NE one2 okay great so - one2 I'm going to put that in parentheses saying hey I'm a negative watch out I have a negative there so minus is minus negative that's our Negative X to the okay x to the what am I going to get 3 cuz I 1 and half 3es right we use improper fractions here cuz they're easier to deal with so -2 minus 1 gives you3 you got that one show hands how people feel okay getting that far on our problem let's make it a little bit prettier simplify some fractions that's one that's two there's the third one in the most basic sense that's your derivative no problem what is that what did I just find what is that that we found oh come on what is it what's the dtive slope of a curve the slope of this curve this weird curve at any point it's kind of neat that we're able to find that right we have no curve looks like we're able to find the slope of that at any point we have a function for it now if you do want to make this a little bit nicer looking you can translate these back into Roots if you really so desire um you could do well I probably wouldn't change that one at all unless you want to do it square root of x to the 7th that's what that means so if you really are forced to do it here's how you would change it back into roots for me most of the time that's going to be fine but if you're forced to plug numbers in you want to see what's actually going on here so this would be 3 < TK X 7th over 2 minus since that's a negative it will be on the denominator of fraction 3 < TK X since that's a negative exponent it will be on the denominator of a fraction along with that two a sare root of x Cub that's the way you would write that without any negative exponents associated with them for yourass most of the time we're going to be okay on that however typically if they get root form you want to make it back into root form so in that case that would be maybe what you see in the back of your book or or uh or some other context how many people feel okay with our example up here so can we do this term by term by term by term can we do that no we cannot separate division we can't do that what we can do is separate our fraction firsthand firstly then simplify each of those and and then take a derivative that's something we can do and that it's not too bad deal deal with a lot of fractions here but I mean that's some algebra we should be okay with our fractions are there any questions before we move on at all do you like these derivative business can you imagine taking the limit of that of X Plus H good thing we had that seriously I'm the only words you know how 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 2.3:   The Product and Quotient Rules for Derivatives of Functions
are you ready to try some more advanced things with derivatives see how we can really use this stuff you ready yeah answer usually yes CU we're going to do it anyway so may as well be happy about it uh 2.3 today you're going to learn some rules you're going to learn about the product rule and the quotient rule here's the scenario let's suppose that we start with two functions I'm going to give you some very basic functions FX = X2 G of x was x cubed here's what I want to know is it possible to take the derivative of one function times another function yes notice how this is f ofx and this is G of X right the question is this the question is is this equal to this I need more room I want you to really write that down and contemplate it is that true question is can I do it can I break up derivatives by multiplication can I break up derivatives by multiplication can I say oh the derivative of f ofx * G ofx is the same as the derivative of f ofx time the Dera of G ofx can I do that I don't know we we have no idea I mean I'm just asking you right now but I can tell you this if if we can find one example where it's not true then this whole scenario falls apart so what we're going to look at is let's look at this example and see if it's true for this now I'll tell you right away that you could get x to the 5th right there couldn't you so we know for sure that this is true this is the same as DDX of x to the 5th what's the derivative of x to the 5th ladies and gentlemen so we know for sure that this is supposed to end with 5x to 4th do you believe me yes no okay okay let's try this way let's let's try to do it the derivative of the first times the derivative of the second what's the derivative of X2 our first what's the derivative our of our second is it the same no we get 6 x cubed okay we got two different answers which one is right 5 x 4th or 6 x to 3r which one's right 5 you should know you should know right now which one is right which one is right this one this one which one's right is this for sure equal to x to the 5th every time every time do you know how to take the derivative of x to the 5th every time we know for sure that this way was right what I'm trying to say is do you end with the same thing I know for sure guys for sure this is the right way this it gives me a correct answer answer the correct answer is 5X 4th that's the correct answer is this the correct answer then no so does this way work so can I separate derivatives by multiplication no no is this true no no bueno uhuh no you can't do that one that's not true you can't separate derivatives by multiplication so what are we supposed to do when we get these functions that are multiplied together we either have to distribute them or we have to find a better way and that way is called the product rule which is the name of our our section here we're going to look right now at how we actually do the product Ru so product rule Ru says well if this doesn't work what is the correct way what do you do if you have one function times another function you're trying trying to find the derivative of those things well here's what you do this is our our rule if you want the proof of this come and see me I'll give it to you it's a little bit too long for our class uh I usually will prove the things but I'm not going to prove the quotient rule the product rule for you want see just come and see me okay so product rule says here's how we're going to go about taking the derivative of a product we're going to take the derivative of the first one the first function times the derivative of the second function I'm sorry the derivative of the first one times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function write that out in symbol so you see it you take the derivative of the first function times the second one you leave the second one alone you add to it the first function left alone times the derivative of the second you've still taken the derivative of each one but it's different than this you have that addition in there that product uh I like to think product plus p goes with P product plus so we're going to have that uh you're going to see in the quotient rule that we were have minus sign in between there so product plus associate the product with a plus by the way would it work for over here let's let's check real quick just to verify okay so DDX of x^2 * X Cub again we're supposed to end with 5x 4th right that's what we're supposed to end with if we do this here's what it says watch what the product rule says to do it says you take the derivative of your first function that would be X2 you find the derivative of your first function times the second function that's how to write that out says you find the derivative of your first function times your are you okay with the notation derivative your first function times your second function then you have a plus sign then you write your first function times the derivative of your second function in English it says derivative of the first * the second plus the first * the derivative of the second let's see if it works what's the derivative of X2 so this becomes 2x oh ladies and gentlemen do I need to take the derivative of x cubed in this case right here you follow the DDX that's why I like the DDX it says this is what you're taking the derivative of that's why we're going to write it like that in this class oh this says take the derivative of this one but don't take the derivative of this one you're only taking the derivative of whatever's inside your brackets there you see it that's why we use that says oh yeah okay derivative of x^2 that's 2x * X Cub plus do I take the derivative of this X2 how about this x Cub yes that's what it said DDX says take the derivative of that that's 3x^2 if we make this a little prettier we have 2 x 4 + 3x 4th that gives us height are we right yeah that works in that case that's not a proof that says it works for that example you have to be able to prove it works for every example Senor for that if you want to or we can just trust it works for everyone you can trust it yeah you can trust if you want I would I mean it does so save me some time but so in English the derivative of the first times the second plus the first times the derivative of the second if you want to write that down you can write that down if you like it at your leisure or just watch the video again and hear me say it like 40 times just press rewind okay derivative of the first * the second plus the first the derivative of the second how many feel okay with that so far now we're going to do one example on how to how to actually do this I'll show you why it can be useful a little bit later on how it really really does help us out a ton and why we need it for right now you're going to be wondering well why can't we just distribute all the time for right now we will be able to distribute all the time and get the same exact answer I'll prove it to you right now I'll show you however later on you won't be able to do that and so the project rule will become very very important for us later for right now it's going to seem like well wait hang on let me show you an example of this hey look at my function do I have a product do I have one function times another function sure absolutely I do I've got this function in parenthesis times this other function but do you see that I could distribute this do you see it if I foiled this all out I could do the derivative that way I could do it for sure I could do that and so you might be wondering why do we need this at all if I can always distribute the answer is well you can't you can't or you probably don't want to for instance what if I gave you now we're not there yet I'm I'm jumping ahead to give you a pre a precursor to what we're going to be doing later but here's why we need the product rule okay you with me on this we're not going to do it now I haven't showed you this yet but what if this was to the 4th okay do you want to distribute that four times and then distribute that one not really heck no no that's ridiculous okay that'd be crazy they'd take up more time than limits would do all right no we don't want to do that we want to find ways around that the product rule is the way around that do you understand that's the idea so it' be good practice to start using the product rule now instead of yes absolutely it's going to on your homework it's going to ask you to do both uh do this two ways I'm going to show you next time how to do this two ways I'll leave you with one don't pack up yet I'll leave you one one more thing but it says distribute this find the derivative then use the product rule it again distribute it and then you're going to find out that you have the same exact thing okay so you're verifying that this product rule does work and distribution does work you get the same exact thing that's what kind of this idea was about as well one last question so a lot of people always ask me so I'm answer right now in the last couple minutes well hey Leonard isn't this a product 3x s isn't that a product no well of course it is it's 3 * x^2 yes why don't we use the product rule for this if it's a product why don't we use the product rule wouldn't it come out different and the answer is we kind of do use the product rule uh but we cheat a little well we don't cheat we just don't show a part of it here's why if you considered this to be a product check this out you'd have the derivative this would be your first and that would be your second true you'd have the derivative of your first times your second plus your first times your derivative of your second all right very good what's the derivative of three 0 * x^2 that's going to happen every time because that's a constant so if you consider that to be a product rule the constant is always going to go to zero so we really don't show that step do we we just show oh look at hey the three's outside that's why we can pull the three outside of our derivative that's a constant we can do that it's product rule says here's positive plus 3 * the derivative that's 2x that's 6X that's why we can do that okay so to answer any questions you might have in your head why don't we have to use a product rle you really are you just you're not showing we're going to start with that problem next time so we're working on our problem I'm going to show you that with the product rule yes there are other ways to do it but ultimately we need the product rule because I think I showed you last time that we're going to have to have that if we have any sort of exponent here or here we're going to need it because you certainly don't want to distribute that out 30 times if that's your x one that would be crazy so how do we do this two ways well way number one is what if we don't even consider it to be a a product at the very end what if we distribute those parentheses and make it so we just have a basic polinomial in this case well if we do that we'll get 3x to 6 + 2 x 3r - 3x 4 - 2x are you okay with that so far check for any like terms do I have any like terms so maybe reorganize it just a little bit because that's the way we like to see our pols and then the question is can you take a derivative of that thing right there yeah that's actually pretty easy so if we do Dy DX what's the derivative of of this this polom can youall tell me real quick thank you all of you appreciate it let's all try this what's the derivative of 3x 6 okay minus what then uhhuh is that it okay so that's our derivative now the product rule should give us the same thing and again we're practicing the product rule in case I give you something like that where you can't just distribute it you'd have to distribute this one and then distribute that would be very annoying so we're going to verify with a couple of these examples that yeah you are going to get the same thing if you use the product rule do you remember what the product rule said to do derivative of the first one first one times the second one add the derivative of the second one plus the first one yeah that's very good so there I think the book has it in slightly different order but because of the commutativity of addition and multiplication it really doesn't matter as long as you take the derivative of one times the other plus the other one times the derivative of like a der of the first times the second plus the first times the derivative of the second or anyway you you kind of permute that that's that's fine take the derivative of one of them times the other then multiply times that one times the derivative of the other in other words for us we'd say the derivative of the first function times the second function so that's our our separation of the product there plus the first function times the derivative of the second so derivative of the first * the second plus the first times the derivative of the second that's how we like to say that it's like I would like to see that are you guys okay on how this is coming about again we can't just take the derivative of this and this and this and this that doesn't work anytime we have a product there we have to use a product rule or we have to distribute and do it term by term so far so good can y'all tell me what's the derivative of x^2 -1 what are we going to get out of that so this will be our 2x * 3x 4 + 2x plus do we take the derivative of this this piece right here folks no no okay so x^2 minus one derivative of this you take the derivative of that 12 12 x the 3 okay plus plus two cool notice how you follow the DDX that DDX tells you what you're taking the derivative of it says the DDX of this yeah but not that one not this one but yes this one so follow the DDX you'll say take the derivative of this little piece if you can do that for these rules it will really really help you out where you have you located getting down that far now is this the same as is that not not yet if we distribute it it should be though let's find out here we'll get our 6 x to 5 + 4x^2 plus we're going to have to foil that right okay don't worry we're not done like wait a second oh no oh no wait wait if we foil this distribute it we're going to get 12 x 5 + 2 x^2 - 12 XB - 2 well at least I see the -2 that's fine you guys okay with the distribution just some basic algebra here now if we do combine some like terms I see a 18 x to 5th cool I see a 12 x - 12 x 3r gotcha I see a 6x2 I have minus two got Aus two now say we wanted to find the second or third derivative can we just use that polom from that point oh sure yeah find the second one bam just look at these are the same derivative right it is the same this is just a different way to go about it of course you like I said before could you distribute that and do it this way absolutely for this one that might be the easier way to go about it it's it's a product rule with just one parenthesis but as soon as you have some exponents everything changes and you definitely don't want to do this if there's some exponents Associated so keep in mind we're building up to things okay we're not there yet we're building up to things I'm giving you kind of like the the groundwork for the stuff we're doing later so yeah you need to understand the product rule before we get to something that's called The Chain rule because then you're going to be using the product rule in associ in combination with that thing and in combination with the quotient rule in combination with these other ideas so you do have to understand it but I'm showing you right now that they they are the same uh it's just a different way to go about it do you guys understand the idea there also have you read through the book the proof of this the proof's in there it's actually not a hard proof there's just one little thing that they do uh they add on an expression that equals zero so they can Factor it and you can prove that the the product rule works really well uh sorry really easily with that so read through that if you haven't done that already that's in this section read through the proof of the product rule and the quotient rule it's not too hard to follow I promise it's not too bad read through that would you like to try a couple more let's do one more with the uh the product rule I'll give you an example of how some of the problems in your in your book are going to look that way you can kind of have a a bearing to go forward with that then we'll talk about the quotient Rule and that'll wrap up our day today so last example of just straightforward product rule it's not too bad all it is is you have to remember uh what the what this this does a der of the first times a second plus the first times a d of the second remember that uh be able to identify what products are and then you're good to go by the way did I show you last time why we don't have to use the product rule for something like this just that term even though it's being multiplied did I show you that okay cool because when they do the product rule with that the derivative the constant goes to zero and that piece falls out of the the expression okay let's do that 1 + X2 and then X2 firstly you need to be able to see that this is in fact a product do you see it's a product what we mean by a product is not just like this okay this wouldn't be considered a product rule explain the difference between something like this and something like this when I say product rule I don't mean what's different between here and here what is Con the constant okay even this this wouldn't be a product rule expon not exponents not just exponents grouped terms though these are group terms you have two different groups of terms with the square root okay different terms that involve what constants or variables okay product rule means we're multiplying variables okay Expressions that have variables in them so this do you need a product rule for that no no that's just a constant you could actually pull that outside of your whole derivative uh the derivative of this thing is going to be 1 * 3 that's what it's going to be okay dtive of X is 1 D of two is 0 1 * 3 would be 3 that would be the derivative right so you get that even if you distributed the three that'd be fine so we're not talking about products of constants times things we're talking about products of functions in terms of x times functions in terms of X are you with me on this which is why we don't have to use the product rule when we find the Der of that piece that's just a constant times something we're talking about functions of x times functions of X you need to see the difference are you okay on the difference in that you sure so do we have a a function in terms of x times a function in terms of X on that problem up there yeah in fact this is it right [Music] there let me erase that three we don't need that let's go ahead and let's try to set up the product rule now could you distribute it and do the work that way of course yeah of course you could you could distribute this would be squ < TK of X Plus x s X2 > X you would have to combine some some exponents there but then you could take a derivative not too bad maybe I'll show you that in just a minute if we do the product rule however why don't you guys figure out how to write out the product rule set up the DDX of the first expression times the second plus the first expression time DDX of the second I want to see that on your paper I want to see the work I don't want to see just the answer okay at this point you're learning this stuff so I want to see every step I want to see it written out just the way I've showed you so derivative of the first time the second plus the first time the derivative of the second after that the calculus is done then you just got to do some elge so first I want to see if you have it set up right let's see check your paper what should have is the derivative of the first times a second function in terms of X do you guys all have that okay then we have What A Plus or a minus between them it's always a plus plus product product Plus plus what comes next do I need parentheses around that I've told you how important parentheses are for this right parentheses being multiplied by something that's important stuff so have that times the derivative of the second expression so hands how many people made it that far great if you made it that far you understand the product rule it's a dtive the first time second plus the first * the Der of the second we have that down now we just have to follow the DDX the DDX is the calculus for us right that's the derivative at this point so if you just follow that little piece take a derivative piece by piece you the right answer so understanding product rule great then just do the DDX okay they're all going to be kind of basic derivatives that we've seen before it's just applying them together within the context of a quotient or rule or a product rule or we'll find out later a chain rule derivative of 1 + X2 what does this give you please great derivative of one is zero derivative of x^2 is 2x * the < TK of X Plus do I take the derivative of this no okay so 1 + x^2 I'll leave it in parentheses time oh derivative of theare root of x might want to change that huh so if we did I'll WR the extra step so you can see it we' do yeah X to the2 if we take that derivative that's 12 x to the2 did you get 12 x to2 cool deal all right very good now making it maybe just a little bit prettier 2x rootx you could combine those with fractional exponents if you wanted to what's on the denominator of this expression on the denominator of this expression on the denominator there's a two there's for sure a two because of that one2 you see the two what else root X because X to the1 that says denominator and then the 1/2 says it's a square root 1 + x^2 is on the numerator unless we want to get fancy and break that stuff up find common denominators we're just about done with that problem how many people feel okay with this one can we conver Square to fractions and sure we can do that as well uh you'd have to distribute from here you'd probably distribute that you'd have uh 12 x 1/2 here and you'd have uh plus 12 x to the 3 and then you would combine that with your other use fractions over there because you two yeah we could do that we could try that so this is 2x2 that's see 1 plus a half is 3 plus if we distribute you'll get 12 x to -2 plus 12 x 3 and we're getting that because of course when you multiply those exponents you add them you add those exponents together that's the three for you so I've just distributed and distributed 12 x to2 and then 12 the x s and the X to 1/2 gives you X to 3 are you all right with that then sure you could combine these as well you end up with like five 5 x 3 yeah 5es X to 3 plus 12 x to the2 if you want to leave it in terms of of x exponents that's probably what you would end up with is those exponents just like that and that's an acceptable way that's actually exactly what you'd get if you distributed this and then took the derivative if you just do it in your head if you want to think about it if you distribute this you're going to get rootx right square root of x the derivative of that is this right there you see it the derivative of this is this one you follow distribute this this is going to be X to 5 she the five halves out of that x to the 12+ 2 x to 12 plus x to the 5 Hales that's what that is distributed uh if you can't get that do it later on your own distribute that and figure out those exponents this derivative is that piece right there the piece of this derivative is 5 halv exra three Hales it's right there it's the same thing same exact thing you okay with this so far all right cool let me show you one more and this kind of this really illustrates the idea of the product rule and see if you can you can do it in general kind of a fun little problem almost like a little puzzle not a hard puzzle don't worry this one time my parents I love my parents to death but they gave me this one puzzle it was uh you've ever done a puzzle that doesn't have straight edges very difficult it was shaped like a butterfly right and instead of having like normal butterfly it was like a psyched GIC butterfly like what do you call it stuff the TIY what it tie-dye yeah it was a tie-dye butterfly with non- straight edges and a non- straight outline I spent at least 18 hours doing it and then ended up burning in the fire blaze it's so ridiculous so it's not a puzzle like that okay this is like one of those four piece jigsaw puzzles you get in like third grade okay no maybe kindergarten puzzles okay you got it fine a double sided puzzle it's not a double-sided puzzle that not fun either two different pictures on different picture on each side oh man that'd be ridiculous not one of those either no it's this puzzle you see before you could have gotten around this problem without without doing the prod rule you could have gotten around this problem this one well you you might still be able to to do that however it's going to be a little bit easier if you if you do the product rule with it the idea is what if you have this and I tell you only two things about it I say F of 2 is 3 frime of 2 is1 and I say find G Prime of 2 that's my goal okay well it's not not too bad what we're going to have to do though is figure out some pieces to fill in we want to find the first derivative of G and then fill in the two do you follow me on this so let's go ahead let's use the product r firstly do you see why we need the product rule here do you see it do you see why do you have a function in terms of x times a function in terms of X this is a function of X yes this is another function of X and they're being multiplied that's definitely the product rule so what I'd like you to do just follow the product rule with this go ahead and do that now follow the product rule I want you to find G Prime of X derivative of the first * the second plus the first * the derivative of the second just write it out derivative of the first time a second yes plus plus the first times a derivative of the second if you want to use DDX you can would you agree that that is in fact the product rule for this problem derivative of the first yep times the second okay plus first got it time second I don't care that the the function is not listed it's F ofx whatever that happens to be that's what would go here and that's what would go here just like in our other examples you you with me on there well let's do the derivative where we can give me the derivative of x^2 + 1 so this is 2x * FX true plus do you take the derivative of that x^2 + 1 still needs to be in parentheses ladies and gentlemen times what's the derivative of f ofx ah frime of x how you'd write that we don't have the actual function but you know that frime of X stands for the derivative of f ofx do you see that okay cool now this would you agree is G Prime of X that's a derivative of G that's what that is what we want to find out is G Prime of 2 what does g Prime of 2 tell you to do everywhere you see X plug in two Everywhere You See CX plug in two everywhere so for us that means tell me what I should have 2 * 2 great because X is two fantastic uh times F of what that's everywhere you see the x correct yeah okay F of two plus in the parentheses tell me what else I got times F Prime of what sure hey what happened to all the X's they became twos this x became two therefore every other X became a two raise your hand feel that so far so it's kind of just a little exercise so you get used to the product rule and then filling out the the numbers with the substitution let's go just a little bit further there's no more X's we can now make some substitutions I know that this is 2 * 2 so that is 4 * hey what is of two have I given you that information 4 * 3 plus this is all five five times what's frime of two cool is it possible sure yeah yeah they have to give you this though they have to tell you what that is I wouldn't be able to do this without that specific information so all together we're going to get cool yeah super fun see puzzle I told you enjoy it puzzling why I find that interesting but uh what did we just find g g Prime 2 yes that's the exactly what we did find what's it represent slope of this curve at that x value so what you just found this is actually a slope the slope would be seven of that curve whatever it is at xal 2 you see that kind of NE we're finding slope always keep that in mind what you're doing is you're finding slope and you're finding digit we still don't know what is nope no you might be able to figure it out or at least something represents it but no we don't know hey ladies and gentlemen are you okay with the product rule in general it's really not that hard of a rule if if you have this down that's it it lets you break up a problem without doing distribution so that you can do it piece by piece and that's the idea now we're going to look at the quotient rule quotient rule is just slightly more involved but it's not that hard either it's a it's again it's just a product it's it's very similar to product same idea you ready to see it yes the proof again is in your book it's not hard to follow go ahead and just look at that then you get home tonight okay so qution rule quotient rule asks this question says can you take a derivative of a quotient something in terms of X over something in terms of X that's what this this question is asking and and the idea is well can I just take the derivative of F and divide by the derivative of G do you think that's going to work no that that never works we can't separate derivatives by multiplication unless use the product rule we can't separate derivatives by division unless use the quotient rule are you with me on that you can't just take a derivative of the top and the bottom that's never going to work for you I give you a very simple example about how that's never going to work for you if you did that you'd get something over Z true yet we know that this would be the same thing as 1/3 x^2 - 1/3 true derivative would be very easy there 2/3 x and that's it so we can't just take the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator that doesn't work for us we have to have some other way to do it by the way you probably wouldn't you could but you probably wouldn't want to use a quotient rule for this very simple example you'd probably break it up just like I did here and then you take a very easy derivative the quotient Rule and the product rule are really really meant for some more extensive ideas things where you you don't have other ways to do it that that's really the the benefit of these rules so I'll show you what the quotient rule says quoti rule says okay in order to take the derivative of a quotient we're going to take some derivatives of each piece but we're going to put them together in a unique way just like we do with the product rule it says you're going to take the bottom function times the derivative of the top function I'm going to use some logic that's not quite mathematical but it's going to make you make you remember something uh product meant plus right p with P product meant Plus what's the opposite of a product a quotient what's the opposite of a plus a minus so what are you going to use here A plus or minus minus okay it's not very mathematical but that's the way you remember it okay product with plus quotient I think quotient has a straight line so quotient has another straight line quotient minus that's how I remember it actually I remember it because I've done this so many times I can't forget it it's stuck in my head like Jingle Bells I have a song for that too um any the math song for Jingle Bells just watch my videos you'll see it quadratic formula song that's right so the low function times the derivative of the high function minus the what would I do high function times the derivative low function all over square or if you prefer if you prefer if you like the DDX format like I do this says the same thing that's the same thing for this to oh there is there is and you know what I think I liked it so I'm I'm going to steal it from Michael so he he he introduced actually I've heard it before but it's a good it said it say again low D high high D L Square the bottom way we go that's right very cool low D High minus high D low Square the bottom and away we go which you have to do this with it otherwise that's a Harry Potter version of this map yeah low D high D High minus Pi d l Square the bottom and Away you go yeah derivative of the bottom I'm sorry derivative of top times of bottom or the bottom times top minus the top times a derivative of the bottom all over the bottom Square that's really what you're doing low D High minus high D low Square to the bottom way you go sound good yes is the first uh first uh is the first one supposed to be the bottom or can it be the top first can yeah hang on can you do that you mean can you interchange these two no uh the from Left of Theus sign can you interchange these two yeah absolutely not because subtractions not commutative like addition is okay if you interchange those is 5 - 7 the same as 7 - 3 I'm sorry didn't work that's not even close to the same it's 5 - 7 the same thing as S no so if I just interchange like wait a second no that's close if I interchange these two things no they're still not the same you can't take the top times the Der of the bottom minus the bottom times the D of the top that's what you're asking you could interchange these the derivative of the top times the bottom multiplication is commutative that would be fine subtraction is not so this is order dependent okay you have to do it that's not true with product rule is it that one it doesn't really matter uh but this one very much so matters that's why I like the new Mark um low D High minus high D low Square the bottom what you go you got it should we practice it I think so thought were going to no pass that I'm not going to make you sing requirement of this course so you made us do in high school I did this is no longer high school we graduated singing MH M now let's look at an example these are slightly different than the product rule because some of these examples can't be done without the potion rule at all you'll see it by the way you're going to find that the taking of the derivatives really isn't all that hard I mean you know pretty much everything there is to know at this point about taking simple derivatives right move the expon to the front you take one away from it that's a derivative of basic functions now it's just using the rules to split these up into little pieces to make them easier so if you know the rules in the dtive hey you're you're good you're fine you're good to go it's like you square the bottom away you go anyway now this problem is a slightly different than if I would have given you this look at the boards notice the difference if I give you that there's something you can do with that separate yeah that's separable you can separate into three different fractions simplify those exponents then take the derivative of every single one that actually might be the way to go for this problem you with me that'd probably be easier than using all this stuff the quotient rule separate three fractions I think some of your homeworkers like that wasn't it separate it simplify the fractions into so combine exponents and then take a der of each little piece and that's fine however as soon as you do this can you do that anymore well you can you can separate three fractions but it's not simplifi like like you did before you can't say x Cub over 2x + 5 is one one term you can't do that anymore you can't separate this 2x plus the five can't do that you see what I'm talking about there now there might be a way if you multiply by the con no still even that it make it worse nothing good can come of this the only thing we can do is is understand that hey that is in fact a quotient right does it fall into the category of the quotient rule which means I have a function in terms of X over a function in terms of X do I I wouldn't want to do it for this that's not a function in terms of X that would just be two that in that case separate them man is so much easier don't use the quo work for stuff you can you can do other things with usually other things are easier so let's try to set up the quoti well why don't you do it you know what I'll do it with you the first I'll give you one in just a second to set it up cuz I want to show you how exactly I want it for dydx that would be the derivative of y with respect to X we're going to take low D High minus high D low all over the bottom squared and then a way or whatever this is um we're going to do that but I do want to see your work I'll give you a partial credit if I see that you know how to do the quotient rule okay which means I want to see every little step you're learning this right now and if I see wrong answers at the end I want to see where your mistakes happened so I want to see all this work understand I want to see it so we take the G of X in that case is the the bottom function the 2x + 5 the low the D the high low D High minus the high the what's our high again and then the D L sounds like c l guess what's The Voice show by the way get so yeah some student earlier said do you have ADD like I don't know look at that butterfly funny over the low Square the bottom Square so we have you don't need brackets here you parentheses if you want low D High minus Pi d l Square the bottom and you're done doesn't quite have the same how many people can follow that though Rich right notice how we we've changed this this quotient into something well these are very easy derivatives very easy you just have to follow the rule to make sure you get it to easy derivatives everything is pretty much going to be like that memorize the derivatives know how to do the derivatives memorize the rules and put them together that's it nothing too extraordinary you know just follow the rules that I give you and you'll be fine I know I make it sound very easy right now okay some of the rules yeah you have to really know how they interplay I'll show you that as we get going but if you understand the rules really well the class becomes kind of a piece of cake after that does the 2x+ 5 change does The X Cub - 3x^2 - 5 change follow the D DDX follow the derivative uh everybody what is the derivative of this please so far so good I don't want to see this garbage from you guys anymore you leave that I'm marking off points from you why you absolutely must have parentheses you're going to be Distributing that in just a second okay so you must have parenthesis there you leave me just this I'm going go no you don't understand what you're doing that's different than this so show me the parentheses where they're applicable does this change no there's no DDX associate with that so X Cub - 3x^2 - 5 okay does this change Y what is that now I don't need parentheses around the two okay that's just one one factor that's all right but the other things yeah you got to have those all over well we're going to have the 2x + 5 and we're going to have a square rarely will you distribute this rarely will you distribute this this one yes we'll distribute this and we'll combine them rarely will you distribute that and the reason is if you can simplify you will you'll try to simplify that thing and it's already factored for you very nicely okay you don't want to get the 4x^2 whatever not Plus 25 but you get 4x^2 + 20x + 25 that's what you get uh you don't really need to do that just leave it the way it is this works out for us very nicely especially when you start graphing these which hint hint you're going to graph those uh without a calculator it's fun like another puzzle double-sided butterfly with psychedelic colors it's that type of puzzle but it's still kind of fun so not a throw in the fireplace type of puzzle it's a fun puzzle uh we we'll talk about how to do that and this form fits a little bit better for us so we'll continue let's go ahead and distribute this can you tell me what you get when you distribute okay I actually heard none of you I'm just doing this in my head thanks a lot guys appreciate it that's okay I know you know how to distribute I'm going to do both these at the same time the negative and the two so - 2xb + 6 x^2 + 10 do you see where the + 6 x^2 and the + 10 are coming from okay good maybe little combine like terms here if we combine some like terms I'm seeing the X cubes that gives me that 4X cubed awesome well I got a whole bunch of x squ going on don't I by the way if I'm making a mistake you let me know I get see a 12 -2 POS 15 POS 6 that looks like it's going to be nine dou that one - 30X that's your derivative what did we just find what's this what's that stand for that's derivative what's the derivative stand for slope of that curve at what point whatever I want so if I asked you to find the slope at xals 1 could you do it sure you plug one into here to find the point 1 comma something true then you plug one into here to find the slope you'd have a slope and a point y - y1 = MX X1 you can find the slope of that that tangent line to that curve at that point so this is still a slope formula now what you would do in general you try to factor this and simplify it if you if you can you can still do that sometimes that will help you now when you have like an X cubed don't really worry about that that so much those are fairly difficult to factor in general if you can try it see what you can do could you take a second derivative of that yes you see you'd have to have another quotient rule however I haven't showed you how to deal with that exponent yet so when you did low D High minus high D low that d low would be the derivative of 2x + 5^ S right so you'd have to distribute that at this point or use a product rule within that at this point yes you can use rules within rules we're going to have a lot of that in this class for instance if you if I do a problem like this one I'm not going to do this for you I just want to give you a heads up if I ask you to find the derivative of that do you see how firstly there is a product rule function of x times a function of X that's product rule then when you go through that as you're doing that that's the first thing you see from the outside in you see a product rule right as you're going through the product rule it would be derivative of the first that'd be fine times the second still okay plus the first all right times the derivative of the second and as soon as you get to the derivative of the second how do you take the derivative of that thing it's a quotient rule you would have a quotient rule that is within the product rule see that so we're going to talk a lot about this how the rules will have an inter play which ones you do first and which ones you do second basically if you can follow the DDX follow the first rule then follow the DDX and wherever you have a quotient then you use quotient rule or a then use product rule we'll get there probably get there right now let's try one that's not very that much put Segway you that wasn't my segue it was a 2C segue come on that's good for me I have ad apparently I the opposite of ad I focus only on math and other things all right now we're going to do this the hard way we're going to do the hard because I want you to see it but there is an easier way to do this the easier way to do this would probably be to distribute this combine like terms and then use one quotient rule right but I want you to see I want you to see how the product rule will play in this because if I do one thing you can't do it anymore I gave you like a five well you definitely wouldn't be Distributing that anymore right so you better learn the other way because I'm certainly going to give you something like that you're going need be able to do it so we're going to learn how to associate the the product rule with the quotient Rule and use a rule within a rule right here now when you look at the first rule to use you got to see which one which one's overlying ENC compassing more of the problem the product rule or the quotient rule qu the quotient rule clearly is it says the product is actually within that quotient do you see it so the first rule we're going to use is quotient rule let's write out the quotient rule what is it again low low de high low what iss my low do I do anything to the low right now low then what D high so we're going to do D high oh nasty low de high and then what minus okay like the minus low DEH High minus the high okay uh real quick I want look at the board here real quick make sure that when you distribute this you still have a a bracket if you distribute St a bracket CU that negative will ultimately change those signs you see what I'm talking about that's important so you would't distribute the negative now you distribute all this and then do the negative lastly let you need a big old bracket around that thing high and then D who low all over what ladies and gentlemen you're saying gra will go from the high the derivative of the second yeah okay yeah that thing like that cuz you distribute all that and then the negative would go okay now can you just stop a side do your product rule for your oh we're going to we're going to do this right now so but I need you to understand that this certainly is the quotient rule for us are you okay with that as quotient Rule now you follow your DDX don't don't change anything much at all this isn't going to change x^2 + 2 s sure this isn't going to change except for that derivative 3x -1 x^2 + 4 and that would give you a * 2x are you okay on that DED yet this is the rough one do you see what this does to you so you'd say this is fine x^2 + 2 okie dokie got that then you follow your DDX and go I don't have to take the derivative of this I do have to take the derivative of this and as soon as you do that to see how that's like a problem within a problem that is a product rule product rule says Dera of the first * the second plus the first * the Der of the second you'd get that this one well we didn't change that at all this one we followed the DDX and just got the 2x so I'll do this very quickly so you just get the answer uh that I'm looking for the derivative of the first * the second plus the first times the D the second that would be your problem do you see how oh I did it really quickly you would show your work off the side and actually should do the product rule this is 3x2 + 4 plus x^2 I'm sorry sorry 2x the Der that is 2x 3x - 1 that's that little piece right there so that's the the product rule after that if you wanted to spend I I'd be impressed if you got down to this far okay that'd be fine um if you want to spend the time and distribute and distribute and then distribute and then distribute and distribute don't foret the negative and then combine all those like terms you use something pretty nasty looking but it's it would be a a polinomial in this case do you see the polinomial I'm not going to go that far it's going to it take me 10 minutes just to distribute everything do you understand the idea of the product rule working with the quos rule what you have to do if you okay with that all right very good

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 2.5:   Finding Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions
we're going to talk about dues yay what a good day aren't you guys glad you're here on Friday oh you better learn it you trust me you want to learn this stuff uh triq functions they're going to come back at you again and again and again and again and again and again again math uh 4 B oh yeah that you spend most of your time doing trig even if you're not doing trig you're doing trig trig substitutions all sorts of stuff in 4B here we just get kind of Basics so you're lucky you're lucky but you really need to handle this stuff so that you next class oh you look so depressed so that next class you're you get it you ready I'm going to prove it to you at least so you know where it's coming from would you like to see that yes okay there's two things we need to understand and they all start from here please tell me you know those do you know those pleas pleases what's this one one very good what's this one good if you know those ones I'll prove to you that we can find the derivative of s cosine tangent secant cosecant cotangent those are the our are six that we're going to be working with a lot in this class okay got memorize those derivatives I'm not going to show you all of them I'll show you one of them the other I'll show you sign right now the one for cosine is very similar the one for tangent cosecant secant cotangent can be done with the quotient rule because once you once you have sign you have a lot of it pretty much done you ready for it we'll start today we probably won't finish today but at least I want to get started what we want to do is if f ofx equals sign I want to find fime well here's what we know we know that to take a derivative uh here's why we need limits again we're going to go back to the the uh the concept of a a derivative as being a limit remember that we took a limit as H approach zero of f ofx plus hus F ofx all over H and you thought you'd never have to deal with that again right we're going to deal with it a couple more times to figure out some derivatives that we don't already know and this is one of them we'll get to what this is and what this is and then we'll stop we we'll uh come back to this on Monday but remember how I had to do f of x plus h and f of x in our case here can you verify that f of x would be sin x and F of X+ H would be sin of x + H are you okay with that so far one thing you need to know when we're going through this you can't separate this X Plus H unless we can use a Trea identity and we will use trig identity but you can't just pull that H out or you can't just do sin x plus sin H that doesn't work so we're going to have to use a trig identity I'll show you that later but for right now here's how far we've made it we know that the first derivative will be the limit as H approaches zero sin x + hus sin x over H are you okay getting down to that far folks you see where that's all coming from cool we'll continue the rest of this next time so well we're right in the middle of this proof we're trying to prove the derivative for FX = s of X and what we're doing is using the limit to prove that because well that is a derivative the other stuff we were just kind of shortcutting the derivative so you need to know that this function right there that is the derivative function so we got to use that for most things uh in case we we know it's a polinomial and can finagle it with our product rules or quotient rules that's really how we find most of the derivatives so here we've made it down we know that f ofx is sinx we know that f of x plus h is sign of X plus h in parenthesis we're going to use one trig identity with this and then we're going to try to get these two identities out of it and if we can do that because those are limits then we'll be able to find the derivative so here's our idea as soon as we make it down to S of X Plus H we're going to use the uh addition rule for for sign which says you can split those things up like this you can say this is equal to you can look it up look up that identity on your own if you'd like s of x + H in those es is the same thing as sin x cine h plus cine X sin H so this part right here is the same as this part right here those are the same so I still have a minus sinx all of are you familiar with that identity have you ever seen that before I just can't remember which one it was called it's the addition says you can separate the addition of that angle like this s of x cosine h plus cosine x s of H now I'm just going to Interchange these two things real quick so I can have uh my S of X next to this s of X I'm going to end up probably factoring that actually I'm definitely going to be factoring that out so let's just go ahead and interchange this term with that term so sin x cosine hus sin x and then plus this thing at the very end are you okay with that so far sure so I just reverse those things now notice that this whole thing is over H right which means I can separate each of those top Parts as over H if I really wanted to True make three different fractions what I'm going to choose to do is a unique thing I'm going to make two fractions I'm going to make this one over h plus this one over H and might see y already do you see y already do you see a sin H over H right now anywhere on the right hand side there's a sin H over H we're going to be able to use that on the left hand side we see a sin x and a sin x we're going to be able to factor that out so we're going to factor the sinx out here I'm going to make this look just a little bit different I'm going to do cosine x * sin H H last little thing if you really want it to look identical I'm going to factor out a 1 see how it's cosine hus1 and we have one minus cosine H you see that actually this this is also another identity I think they give that to you in the book as a matter of fact it's the same exact thing if we factor out a negative one from that you could do just to make it look identical this would become a negative sign times if I factor the negative 1 out those will reverse I will get 1us cosine H the cosine will become negative the one will become positive over yes sir are you guys okay with our algebra so far yeah I got lost where where you got the cosine hus one from I have factored out sinx from this term and that term so if I factor out sinx I get H if I factor out sin x I get one factor me division so we're dividing yeah um where does the H how come the over H I mean it's not coine over H in the second one this one yeah 3x/ 2 is the same thing as 3 * x 2 good questions you right with this so far you okay that factor on a negative or reverse two terms good deal see anything that pops up in our problem yeah we see some identities right and because limits are separable we can separate those those limits by addition further by multiplication we can separate limits like that not derivatives but limits and this is now a limit what is the limit of 1 - cine H over H how much is this so negative sign * 0 that's going to give you zero that part gives you zero are you okay with that are you sure you do one more step if you want this is remember okay let let meit make one more thing clear what is going to zero the H or the X the H is going to zero not the X the H so the X's stay the same just like you did with your derivatives remember doing your derivatives of limits your X stay the same so this would be sinx time 0 that's going to give you zero plus what happens to the cosine X does it go to one no cosine X stays the same because it's an X that's not an H cosine X time what's s limit of sin H over H how much is that 0 + cosine X cos x is that interesting no no don't care you're going to Care Co it better be interesting you're going to have to memorize it firstly it says the derivative of s is cosine what's the derivative stand for which is weird right because it says find the slope at any point on sign plug a number into cosine you have the slope on sign that's weird it's kind of unique we proved it though right agreeable to follow the proof so now do we have to do this again no you don't have to do it again you now have the derivative of sign the derivative of sign is cosine is it revers no I'm going to give you all of them right now it's not exactly reversible the derivative of cosine is not s okay it's not s it's close to that but it's not sign I'll give you all those right now I'm not going to show you the proofs the proofs are for cosine are done very similarly okay you do cosine very very much the same as this this uh very similar to this one let's see if I can think you'd still you'd still separate it You' still do your factorization uh but you'd end up with having a negative up front and that's going to be what we get we going to see that in our derivative of cosine right now so derivative of sinx is what folks good so whenever you see that from now on you got it that's it let me give you the rest of them this will be kind of like a memorization table for you you got to know this stuff are there any questions on this uh anymore before we continue right so here we go if you want to take a derivative of s you know it's going to be cosine that's our number one now the derivative of cosine again you can find it doing the same thing that we did turns out that it's not exactly sign it's negative sign negative sign you want to see that coming coming see me I can prove that to you but once you have those ones check out what happens what's Tan x what's tan what I'm sorry not the derivative of it but what is Tan x the identity it's what over what so with a quotient rule you could find Tan x because you'd have S over cosine use a quotient rule work it all out simplify it and what you're going to end up with is see squ X so the derivative of tan X is secant 2 x again if you want to see these well I don't know if they prove them in your book but you can come and see me I'll show you the or do the quotient rule on your own that might be an example for you to try later do the quotient rule on S over cosine do you see what I'm talking about s over cosine do the quotient rule on S over cosine it'll work out eventually to see squ X might take a little bit of trigonometry to get there but it will there's three more let's try see what's the derivative of secant x well notice how secant is really one over cosine isn't it you could really do a quotient rule with that if you wanted to the derivative of one would be zero though so that might be kind of nice for you over the the cosine squ what's going to end up working out for you is secant tangent secant x tangent X if you did what's the next want to do cosecant derivative of cosecant well cosecant is one/ s so if you did the quo rule again you should be able to find out what cosecant is this is netive cosecant coent last one what I miss make sure I'm right yeah netive cose 2 x I really should have these switched so you really see something about it I'm not going to though because that would involve me rewriting it I really don't want to do that so look at a couple things firstly s goes to cosine cosine goes to negative sign if you look down here with the these really should be opposite to match up with the uh cosecant and see do you see what I'm saying mhm the cosecant would match up with our sign but it gives you a different sign so negative the secant gives you the positive that's a different sign but look at this secant cosecant tangent cotangent that kind of matches up little bit at least you can make that similarity there also if tangent gives you secant squar cang gives you negative cosecant squar you see the secant cosecant relationship the square the square positive negative so learn those ones maybe you can get a relationship in your head that how how to remember it I remember that in that certain way way so that's how I do it but you're going to need to memorize those cuz they come up a lot so you're going to find those out a lot and a lot and a lot did you got those I don't expect you to memorize them right now so if I go uh coent you're go I don't know well Co yay got it but ultimately you need to remember them uh for the test and things like that okay for your homework you go a lot quicker if you have to look them up all the time well I'm going to leave those on the board would' like to do a couple examples on how to use these sure of course yeah one day we should all act like we're it what do you mean act like in drama class you know this is the highlight of my life this is the highlight of your life he going to break his P this is literally without calculus one you can't do calculus 2 two or three differential any your next classes are worthless if you can't do this means you won't get a job you won't get married unless you're already married if you don't finish this you'll be divorce no I'm just kid just kidding kidding you won't get a job no money no car no girl it's Friday you got no job you don't end up like that right so this this what did you say it was the highlight of your life no it's the highlight of your life I think that's the the straw man logical fallacy that's just slippery slope actually I thought it was building up something in Slippery slpp I have fil 10 right now what did I do slippery SLP I slippy sled you all tell them Mr Leonard slippy slope me just make sure they know the context I don't know kids are weird sub I want us to find the derivative for y = x sinx that's what that's my goal that's what we want to do now I'll tell you what I have a lot of people right now who are going to do this because they don't see something that they should be saying a lot of people if they look at that the first time they go oh well that's very easy the derivative will be cosine X one time cosine X you see how they could make that mistake what do you need to do in order to do this derivative explain why it's a product rule I have a function of x times a function of X do you see it that's important for you guys to start seeing that stuff so that's definitely a product rule so we're going to have to set up the product rule go ahead and set it up Dera of the first * the second plus the first * the Der of second set that up after that it's almost a non problem these ones are kind of nice or this one can that's the appropriate way to set that up that's the product rule it says a derivative of the first one * the second one plus the first one time a der the second one do you have that on your paper something that will match that okay cool uh now we take it where the ddxs are we we don't take derivative of things that don't have an immediate DDX that says take the derivative of this little piece what's the derivative of this little piece okay do I take the Der of that so that should still be 1 * sin x you follow so sin x plus do I take the derivative of x no I'm leave it X do I take the derivative of sin x and what's the derivative of sin x good not negative cosine just just cosine X time cosine X so cos x so our derivative is sinx plus x cosine X what's it stand for what did we just do SL slope that's a slope because that's a derivative so this is the slope of that this is a slope function for that curve so everywhere we want to find the slope if we just plug in that point to here that would give us a slope of that are you with me on this so far I want to do a specific one I want to say find the tangent line give you an easy one at x = 2 hey tell me something what two things do you need to make the equation of any line point slope okay do we have a point yet no not really a point has something comma something we only have a something so we don't have a point do we have a slope kind of we have a function that will give you the slope do we have either of them right now the way it is no what I want is I want an m equals and I want a point that's what I want I use the top function well let's see let's let's talk about that if I wanted to find the slope right now the slope right now I have a function for the slope would I plug in to here to find the slope no to here to find the slope what am I going to plug in to find the slope yeah because that's my x coordinate that will tell me the slope of that curve at that point at the x equals that value so let's plug that in I'm going to have s of Pi / 2 plusun / 2 * cosine 2 that's what this looks like s / 2 +un / 2 * cosine 2 it's going to help you if you know this the basic angles of this the the basic cosine of pi over 2 pi 4 Pi at least those ones what's s of Pi / 2 what's cosine of Pi / 2 so this is 1 + < / 2 yeah it doesn't change * 0 how much is this whole thing so my SL is one oh that's a nice SL very cool yeah we the SL is one with that are you okay with this you we just basically plugged that value into this slope for function and got out one that's our our expression let's do the point what goes here good because it's my x coordinate says x = 2 2 how can I find my y yeah you know what even says it to you doesn't it says y equals so it says what's y equal tells you right there y equals something in terms of X plug in the X so it's going to be X sin x x sin x that's try y = x sin x so Y in our case Pi / 2 * sign ofun / 2 sure so s of piun / 2 you all gave me that is 1 < / 2 * 1 is 1 I no no it's not what are you talking about it's two 5 2 * one you're like yeah yeah no no two sorry got ahead of myself now we have a point of slope now go ahead and use y - y1 = MX - X1 to figure that out what' you get what's that mean this way vertical vertical vertical be like this diagonal no this is like yeah like this yal x yeah it's a diagonal line SL of one no problem so we can now find tangent lines with trigonometric functions as well as long as we know how to take those derivatives be aware that the product rule and the quotient rule will appear here it's going to happen would you ra have feel okay with this so far good I'm going to give you one to do on your own let's see how good you are let's do start here I'll leave this on the board for you for a second I'd like you to find the D of that no tangent line right now just find the derivative okay [Music] [Applause] remember this is certainly a quotient rule so low D High minus high D low Square the bottom way you go you also need to use parenthesis where appropriate don't leave those things hanging out if you're multiplying by something for did you get the same thing as I did low D High minus high D low at least you set you set up right mm okay now we follow the DDX it's all this calcul up is about follow the DDX go slowly precisely get the right derivatives as you're going so we have the formula set up correctly just follow the DDX and show you work if you try to do too much of stuff in your head I swear it's really hard uh you got to go slowly write lots lots of work out I know that takes a tremendous amount of paper but trust me it's work it you want to get the right answer slowly rather than the wrong answer quickly that that' be the wrong way to go so here we'll have do I take the derivative of 1 plus cosine X there I need parentheses still because I'm multiplying times the derivative of sin x what's the Dera of sinx folks good okay got it minus I don't take the derivative of sinx but I do take the derivative of 1 + cosine X what's the derivative of 1 + cosine X what happens to the one derivative of one would give you zero then you do the derivative of cosine that's going to give you a negative sign so we're going to be multiplying here by negative make sure it's in parentheses because you're multiplying by a negative there you're not subtracting multiply by negative sinx all over don't forget about that bottom 1 + cosine x^ 2 how made it that far good hey calculus is done right as soon as you finished that there's no more D if as soon as there's no more ddxs your Calculus is over with now it's just algebra and manipulation of those rational expression well not even rational those expressions right now uh so our trigonometric rational expression so if we distribute here we're going to get cosine plus good then what sin X2 is not the same as Sin s x this you're squaring sign this is not that is not the same thing if you're putting that this is an angle right here we're actually squaring the sign this is the same sure that's what I was writing that is that is that right but if you omit those parentheses now you got this is wrong okay this implies this that would be incorrect okay you can't do that can't change those angles unless you actually use one of the formulas to change angles so we're going to put our sin x like that are you with that so far cool cool tell me something awesome that happens yeah trigonometry is awesome it's happening right now calculus also awesome it's happening right now uh but something even awesomer I yeah what identity you need to see the identity what's this give you that's a one cosine 2 X Plus sin s unless I'm wrong that doesn't happen very often just kidding it happens all the time but yeah that's one so this is that was funny and nothing it must be Monday killing me today cosine x + 1 over 1 + cosine X Square give me something else take off the square can you cross those out do you see how there one entire term one entire term right now one one H well factor I suppose one entire Factor here with here so that and that is gone what's on our numerator still and that's our derivative would you raise your hand and feel okay with this one so far good deal all right what did we just find again that is a derivative what is a derivative so we found the slope that's a slope function if I asked you to find an equation of a line through a certain point you'd use that for your slope you'd plug in your value to that to get your point and then you use y - y1 x - X1 same ideas are you guys all right with this so far by the way if I asked you for so a different example that could you do it yes okay what does that mean by the way just a second derivative let's take the second derivative so let's find that what's the first derivative please okay the find the second derivative sure D cos sin x what's a third derivative say it again negative cosine X would be the third derivative are you with me on that negative cosine because if we if we have sinx the derivative of s is cosine this is negative cosine if I take the derivative how about the fourth derivative why derivative of cosine Isa sign * negative gives you a positive sign that's interesting it's really weird how about the fifth derivative six let's see uh let's see fifth der six d 7 8 back forth oh that's Cal so when we take that derivatives of sign like that that's kind of interesting unless we have a quoti rules it is cyclical eventually by the way could you have done this if I asked you to evaluate this at x = / 2 what's that mean to do plug that in you're going to get netive one in this case you with me on that so we can evaluate also just don't forget what that means this would mean that this is one so we have negative one you still okay so far are you ready to try just a a word problem that has this as some of its base is um y of X when you take it to the fourth is that due to the S of x s x period coming back to the same coming back like it shows in the text the sign of X goes over and it shows where where the D would occur for for S of X and is does that have anything to do with it oscillating back and forth oh it has it has a lot to do with oscillating yeah I mean you got to figure that if if the derivative of s is cosine that means that the slope of s is cosine but the slope of cosine is negative sign if we keep on doing that we're just finding basically the fourth derivative is a slope of the third derivative if the third derivative is cosine we're going to be getting sign out of that which is it's really it's interesting problem but it does have to do with it it's U the relationship between s and cosine talking about the like goes up and down like that right whether the fourth DP has to do with that it where it oscillates you know because it goes and it comes back to the same position once you get once you go four times over we're not moving oh we're not no we're not he's talking about the SC for how it osc oh I get it yeah I understand how it goes like this remember we're not we're talking about the slope of the the entire function so we're not saying as you go four periods to the right or four Cycles to the right that's not not quite what we're doing we're tring with the slope of a curve so for instance it's going to be very hard for me to draw this but this is the idea that we're talking about here that's sign right that's a slope right oh mess up it's kind of pretty huh closer if you take and graph the value of the slope at every one of these points from here to here and you say at x equals this point the slope is this x equals this point the SL is this and this and this and this and you graph those what you're going to end up with is actually cosine here's why slope of this point is actually one there slope at this point is zero ah slope at this point is NE 1 there slope at this point is back to zero coine okay do it again you're going to do the same thing right slope is zero negative negative negative negative you're going to get negative sign but you're going to go back and forth and back and forth you're talking about slopes of things slopes of and the third derivative second der the slope of the slope function fourth of the slope of the slope of this you're just talking about the previous the slope of the previous function does that make sense to you that that's why you getting these things you're not moving at all you're talking about the slopes of your function that's the idea looks cool though doesn't it pretty does that answer your question okay now for a real example I'm not going to call this a super fun word problem because I got a comment on my little thing that was not super fun so this is just a word problem this is a super hard word problem hard it's not I'm just joking no sense of humor today at all nothing honestly stand up next time maybe we'll get it got that one of Taiwan I don't okay so let's say that you put a spring on the ceiling right here and you you attach a weight to it it's going to stretch a little bit right let's say you hold it real steady and so it's just it's stretching that spring and just it's sticking there and one of your jerks comes along what's it going to do it's going to go right back and forth let's neglect friction of air and all that stuff is it going to do that forever no let's neglect like friction and all that is it going to do that forever yeah it's going to oscillate right it's not it's not going to lose anything if we just let it go and go and go in the vacuum and stuff like that that okay it's just going to do that forever and ever that's going to mimic a sign or a cosine function as a matter of fact if we look at this I'll write out the example right now uh we we attach a spring and a mass stretches at 3 cm Beyond its resting position a spring is stretched 3 cm Beyond its resting position and released so you go to the thing go and it goes okay so it's oscillating back and forth at let's make it at a certain time at T equals z let's talk about the position function let's talk about the position function if you if you were to draw this let's say this would be the the spring and here's a little weight that's attached okay and you're going to stretch this 3 cm Beyond its resting position so stretch implies that you're going to pull it down further true are you going to start at zero when you oscillate where are you going to start 3 cim down one two you're going to actually start at -3 true and what's going to happen is it is going to go up reach a climax go down and up and down and up and down true so it's going to go up and then down and then up down just like that forever and ever and ever what does that look like does that look like a sign a cosine a positive sign or a negative uhga sorry a sign a cosine positive negative sign or a negative cosine which one negative cosine negative sign would look like this starting at zero and going this is a negative cosine starting negatively and then going up so if we were to to make a model of this we'd say it starts at -3 but it's definitely a cosine function because I'm not starting at zero it's negative because it's like the the reflection of a normal cosine it's starting down here instead of up there that would be positive three you okay with that so far all I'd like us to do is talk about the velocity the velocity of the mass at a certain point so we know it's going to be oscillating back and forth and really the velocity should be zero here and here and here shouldn't it because that's where it's changing going up to going down it's going to pause and go down what I'd like to do is just find the velocity for this find the velocity function what's velocity as it is related to position so basically just find the first derivative so find the first derivative of -3 cosine T first question I have for you since I have -3 * cosine of T do I need a product rule or not explain that explain why I don't need a product rule here yeah I don't have a variable at all I don't have a function of T I just have the number3 being multiplied by that right and if I did the product rule you take the derivative of -3 that should give you zero and so that would fall out of your equation anyway you don't need the product rule for this so this one we'd say all right the3 is a constant that will be there no matter what SO3 * our derivative what's the derivative of cosine of T can you tell me what that is so-3 * s t I'm showing you a little extra step so that you can see what's actually going on here -3 * s of t uh what's what's that going to give you now could I ask you things like um where will this curve have a velocity of zero could you find it now if you set that equal to zero you know what you're going to find you're going to find this point and that point and that point every point where it changes from rising to Falling or falling to Rising that would give you those horizontal slopes right right that would be a velocity of zero where it's changing um I can also ask you for any tangent line here say find the tangent line at Pi 2 find the tent line at 3 pi over 4 things like that you should be able to do that as well how many people feel okay with what we' talked about so far good deal right are you ready for the next thing yes yes the answer is yes you you are I know cuz I'm your teacher I could tell you're ready here's the next thing the next thing ask this question we're just going to do a little little intro right now it says can you take the derivative of this can you take the derivative of that yes of course of course you can what's the derivative of that thing cool and if I did this can you take the derivative of that thing really how would you do it okay you could use the product rule couldn't you you could do 3x^2 - 4 * 3x2 - 4 you do the product rule or maybe a little bit simpler you could distribute this true and then take it term by term right what that one you can still do it but you're going have to distribute probably three times or distribute it once and then use a product rule either way it's going to get a little bit more tedious right okay what about that one you go you use the power Ru s that's crap not CR oh crra CR CR you Leonard yeah no not crra crap oh crap why crap because this is ridiculous you don't have to distribute that out 100 times or use a product rle like 5 I don't know what it 100 times uh you don't want to do that do you we're going to learn something that's called The Chain rule what the chain rule allows you to do is treat your function like a composition to get around the fact that you have a large exponent or treat your function to as a composition so that you can get around something like this cuz I haven't showed you how to do that the answer to this write this down and cross it out is never this no I'm going to show you how we can use compositions in something called The Chain rule to deal with these two types of problems because these two types of problems come up in awful L if you know the chain rule you can deal with them very very concisely if you don't you're stuck you're stuck with this you understand the idea about why we're going to learn the chain rule next then we're going to tie everything together chain rule is the last rule that we have uh then we're going to go ahead combine product rule quo rule chain rule all that stuff make it real nice you'll be able to do every derivative that I give you 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 2.6:  Discussion of the Chain Rule for Derivatives of Functions
I'm not a spontaneous person the jokes are scripted you'll never know you're thinking was that scrip we're going to talk about the chain rule today chain rule oh man it's so cool it lets you tie all this calculus stuff together uh this is the last major rule that we have we will talk about implicit differentiation which leads us to related rates something very useful for for you uh but as far as the rules go this is it this is the last derivative rule that you get other than that it's pretty much just applications so that's kind of nice right so basically the rules are product rule equ rule chain rule most of your Calculus rests on that most of your derivative rests on those those rules so what this is what the chain rule does it gives you a way to do derivatives with compositions so let you take derivatives by using compositions and just to refresh your memory on why we might do this I'll give you that example again and it's on the last video so I want to make sure it's on this one as well uh this is the reason why we want to learn the chain rule I I gave you this to you earlier I said can you take the derivative of that thing easily in fact if I if I did this dtive would be 6X and then you're done right and I said I built on a little bit I said okay well what if it's not that what if it is squared could you still take the derivative that's is yeah you probably foil that out right distribute it and then take it turn by term I said okay well what happens if it's if it's cubed and you go I still do the same thing or it could or use the product rule I could still do that distribute one of them use product rule but as soon as we get to things like this and I think this is where I went the O crap right you go come on man are you serious do we really have to do that yeah but if you think you're going to distribute this 100 times I mean that that's just a waste of time so there's got to be a better way to do derivatives of this and as a matter of fact there is it's actually not hard it it's kind of an easy way to do it and you're going to like this so all the times where you had to distribute remember like when you had this squared you had to distribute that right like in the first set of homework you're like oh man this is tedious well and the tedium now this takes care of that so anytime you can see a composition I'm going to I'm going to show you the composition here in a second you can use chain rule so I come with with theme music now all right the question is can I express this thing as a composition which is why I had you cover compositions and had you go with the reverse of compositions looking for a function within a function that's why we did that so we get to this point like oh yeah I kind of understand that idea now so can I express this as a composition and the answer is yeah I can and here's how you do it here's a a pretty basic way to do these things what you're going to do you're going to cover up the inside of your function so what I mean by the inside here is the the 3x 2us 4 you with me on that you're going to cover that up and you're going to go okay I'm going make a function y equal to whatever you covered up becomes an X you know what let's make it a uh let's make it a u a u to the 100th make it a u to the 100 do you see how how I got that do you see that by by holding this part out I get a function it's very basic yal U 100 you see where the U the 100 is coming from but then you have another function to to express you now need to say okay well U is going to be what did you cover up then that has to be your U and that would be a very basic composition do you see if I put the U in for this U this expression in for this U I'm going to get that back again can you see the composition here basically if you cover it up you go okay that's U to the 100th and U is what's under my hand and that's that's how we get those two things have be loated with that so far so sure this is a composition that's not bad at all well could you find Dy du could you find that what's this mean to do derivative of y of Y with respect to what you oh with you okay so so do it what's a derivative with respect to you that should be a very easy one for us you okay with that so far you sure okay can could you find Dux could you find Dux that's the derivative of U with respect to X how much is that going to be that's the 6X are you okay with with these two things so far so we write this as a composition we take the derivative of the first expression that's the like overlying function we take the derivative of the inside expression that's what we chose as our composition to compose into that but the problem is this what we ultimately want to find is dy DX right we don't have that yet we have Dy du we have D DX but you're going to find out right now why we stick with this notation because this is kind of cool are you ready for it if we want to get dydx so what about dydx what about dydx the question is can we put these two things together in such a way that it will equal dydx for instance I'm looking at a dyd I'm looking at a d DX do you notice how the DU here is on the denominator and the DU here is on the numerator and we have a d d y on the numerator which we want and a DX on the denominator which we want what operation can I put between this one and this one so the duus would be gone and I get dydx yeah you know what look at this if I say well let's just take dyd let's multiply it look like an a let's multiply it by DX the beauty of this notation is that those little pieces do act like something you can cross out something you can simplify so what happens to the duus in this case they're gone this right here is the chain rule what it says is that dydx will be equal to Dy * D DX this is changing that's the chain okay so how do we use it in practice let's let's apply it to this scenario okay so when I ask you for DDX of 3x^2 - 4 to the 100th power who cares where you got that from can you do the derivative here's what it says it says take your dyd take your dyd that's this yeah I'll that way take your dyd times your D DX in our case that's the derivative with respect to U of U to the 100 that's where we got this right derivative with respect to U of U 100 are you seeing where that's coming from then it says times the derivative of the inside the 3x^2 - 4 that's the DX do you see that D ydu is this thing it's the derivative of your your function with respect to U that's what this part is are you okay with that the D DX that's the Der of what you call U the derivative of what you call U is the inside part if we take that derivative it says multiply dyd * D DX so take the derivative of the overlying function multiply by the derivative of the inside function that's that's what this says to do uh what was this again times what was that again do you see a problem with this yeah we have x's and we have 's we want which one what X's do you know how much U is equal to sure that's why you had this over here so if we can do that substitution we go okay the X looks great to me but the U doesn't look so great I want to make that U Back Into What U equals so let's do that we'll get 100 3x^2 - 4 because that's our U to what power don't forget about the 99th power don't forget about the exponent time 6X now you could make it a little bit prettier but I want to come back to this and talk about this for a second okay because I want you to see the practicality of the chain rule uh firstly what are you going to do with this this you're going to do something with this what are you going to do with this 6X multiply by what number yeah do that okay don't leave it hanging out there as a Time 6X at the end now naturally please don't please don't do this don't distribute the 100 okay you can't do that because that's an exponent that says in order to distribute the 100 you'd have to foil that out 99 times do you get it please for heaven's sakes don't do that all right don't do that just multiply this number times this number and we get 600x 3x^2 - 4 all to the 9 power that's it that's a pretty easy way to do a derivative is't it not too bad now let's look at what actually happens here because I want you to see this this is going to be in general what we did is there a way that you can get from here to at least well actually probably this step we can get almost from here to here in one step without showing a u without showing a a d DX and a Dy du without showing that stuff I want you to think about what we're doing do you see what happens to the 100 what happens to the 100 power yeah that's basically just your power rule do you see it the 100 comes down to the front you leave this thing alone right that's in the parentheses it says you leave it alone why do you leave it alone because you end up substituting back in the U that's why because with the composition you're going to get that U Back Again do you see that you're going to have some U here you're going to get that so we have a U Back Again that means you don't change inside where's this piece come from where's the 6X come from yeah and this is called the general power rule it's a Cory of the chain rule the chain rule is the overarching idea but what we can do often times with this is something called the general power rule and it says the power rule Works in general if you do this and I'm going to show it to you right now so general power rule so when you ask me well wait I thought you said there's only three rules there there really are there's only the product rule the quotient Rule and the chain rule however the general power rule is like a little piece of the chain rule okay you get the general power rule from the chain rule do you understand so the general power rule says what if you need to take a derivative of some function to some power what if you need need to take the derivative of some function of some power here's how you do it this is called the chain Rule and here's how you do the chain rule I can show it to you if you really want me to this is what would happen you'd say okay what's my what's my function you'd say y equals U to the N true where U would equal f ofx Do you believe me you follow still that's what the chain rule would say well this says okay if I took the derivative of U to the N remember your power rule power rule says you bring down the exponent you subtract one from it true this would say Okay Dy d du would equal n u the nus1 follow me so far du DX would be the derivative of of f ofx that's oh how do I want to write it I'll just say this the derivative of f ofx you could write frime of X you could write that as well are you guys okay that the derivative of U n is n u nus1 and the derivative of FX is the derivative of FX does that make sense to you i' write this way so we have a formula in just a second do you see the chain rule it work we have dyd we have du DX so in order to find dydx we'll have Dy du time du DX well what that says is do a substitution that's n U nus1 times the derivative of your function from the inside how much is U what's U equal to because we did that composition what was u in our case so do that substitution back into there and what you end up getting is n f ofx to the N minus one DDX of f ofx now did we say anything about F ofx at all do we make any qualifications about F ofx so then this should work in general right anytime we have a function raised to some power we could use the chain rule on every single time we led to a formula I just invented this formula for you did you guys see it it's kind of cool right invented the formula for you we we did a composition we can do that we took the derivative here we took the derivative here we know that to get dydx we multiply those two things then we just do our substitution back in for you what that says is if you want to take the derivative of some expression raised to some power all you've got to do is take the derivative of the expression times the derivative of the inside that's what you're doing uh bring down the exponent as usual then multiply by the derivative of the inside that's what the says it in English look look what it says bring down the exponent as usual bring down the exponent as usual then multiply by the derivative of the inside inside that's what that says to do ra have to feel okay with that so do you have to to show me all this to do it no I just proved it for you this this is kind of a proof for you to be able to do that you get it so in English if you want to hear this in English bring down the exponent as usual as you normally do for the power rule that's why it's called the general power rule so bring down the exponent like it's a power rule just multiply by the derivative of the inside you just can't forget about the derivative of the inside cuz this thing matters for sure if you don't have the 6X here does it affect your problem yes oh heck yeah yeah by long shot okay so that does matter bring down exponent and multiply by derivative of the inside would you like a couple examples to kind of work through this and then after that I'll show you some more applications of the chain rule stuff that we can do with some trigonometry which I know you're going to love right uh stuff you can do with that that you can't forget that you need to do with that I'll show you how to work with the chain Rule and then after that uh we'll talk about implicit differentiation if there's a little bit of time okay so let's address this problem if I want you to find the ydx which is what I want you to find could I just do this could I just take the derivative of this and this and this and leave it to the fourth power the answer is no no because this is a composition do you guys see the composition this you could cover the whole thing up and call it U or sorry call it yeah call it U to the 4th why would equal U to the 4th and U would equal this stuff does that make sense to you we could do the chain rule here does this fall into the category of general power rule is it some function raised to two an exponent that's what we're looking for do you guys see the power rule in it how we get the power rule that says here's what we're going to do we're going to do the power rule just like we normally would we'll bring down the exponent we'll subtract one from it just don't forget to multiply by the derivative of the inside so you tell me what to do now that we've talked about it what do I do bring down four good four goes down do I still have an expression here yes what's going to be on the inside of my expression do I change this at all from here to here no that's because that's the U right and you're going to be substituting back in for the U ultimately at the very end of any problem so that inside that's not going to change that's this look at see how we still have a u and we substitute back in the original function to that that's the original function here you're still going to have that so far so good wait a minute right now this is so far so good no what's wrong don't you know what the biggest mistake have people do this they bring down exponent and they forget to subtract from it it's derivatives are not that hard right doing the general power rule you know you're supposed to bring it down subtract people always forget the exponent don't forget the exponent so we do bring it down sure but that four that was a exponent of four we subtract one from it we're going to get three is that okay is are we done now we're good though we bring down the expon we subtract one from it and now you get to do this part the derivative of whatever the inside is the f ofx is the inside of your general power rule it says do this do the power rule no problem leave that alone and then multiply by the derivative of whatever was inside Let's see we got four got the same same thing notice how the calculus is done do you see how what I mean by follow the DDX do you see what I mean by that it's all about where the DDX is that's what your Calculus is so here this is staying the same the only thing we got to worry about is that over there what is it if I leave it just like this am I going to Mark points off from you absolutely why I need to have the parenthesis firstly that says I'm multiplying the whole entire expression now you got a couple choices you can move this thing out front and you can distribute that for into there if you'd like just make sure you have parentheses around it if you do it does that make sense so that you might see a problem end like this you might see a problem end like this or you might see the problem end like this just make sure you have parentheses there or otherwise yeah I'm going to Mark you off because that's a different statement now your question is which one do you want Mr Leonard and I go as long as you need to hear I'm happy with your Calculus now I want one of these two I want one of those two out of you what I can't have you do don't keep going okay there's no way you should ever foil this into the actually be foil oil right outside ins but you should never do that because that's to the third power you can't break the order operations exponents come before distribution or multiplication does okay so you can't break this rule but this is this would be perfectly appropriate how do you feel okay with this so far are you ready to see that we've been doing this literally the entire time with our power rule see general means encompasses all right so check this out if I give you X to 6 just a simple example and I say why don't you take the derivative of x to the 6 you know when that that is 6 x 5th right okay inherently actually wasn't inherent I guess cuz I taught it to you but you know it nonetheless but if you applied if you applied the the general power rule of this check it out if you said oh well that's a function in terms of X I write a little better so you can really see it I said that's a function in terms of X could you do the general power rule to the answer is yeah you could check it out you would do the six x 2 the fth remember that would be in parentheses right because that's your function times the derivative of whatever's inside only this time the inside is X what's the derivative of x that's why we didn't have to show that because the derivative of the inside is always the same thing it's always just X do you get it we've been doing the general power rule we've been doing the chain rule the whole time it just it was simpler because we didn't have that inside so that would become one and you get 6 x 5th interesting we've been doing that's why it's called the general power rule and we had the power rule before you ready to keep going yes okay let's try a few more we're going to start building on this idea [Music] though give me two ways to do that problem dist distribution it's one of them give me another way you have two ways to do this problem right as soon as I do this do you still want to distribute No in fact if they gave that to you before that would be how you had to do that right cuz there was no way to get rid of that three for you without foiling that all out and then Distributing it or foiling at least this out and then using product rule in fact maybe you had to do that on a couple of your examples and it's like darn exponents but now let's look at this for for what it is this is a derivative can you see a product rule in it still can you see a general power rule in it right now yes question is which one comes first well half of you are right which happens the question that's the that's the question uh which one working from the outside in which one encompasses more of the problem you should be able to say this you should be able to say this whole thing has to do with does the whole thing have to do with the general power rule which means is that exponent of three applied to the whole thing right now then that does not come first is the product rule applied to the whole thing right now then that comes first does that make sense to you it' be the same as this question which one would come first a general power rule or a quotient rule what do you think definitely a yeah the general power rule is only applied to this little top part right it doesn't Encompass the whole problem the quotient rule encompasses the whole problem that would come first work from the outside inside now if I did this you'd hate me first off which would come first in this case chain rule chain rule in our specific case this would be you can say CH chain rule that's fine this would also be called the general power rule do you see it general power rule and then you would do the quotient rule then general power and then general power rule inside of that yeah okay that would be nasty one way that you could make this easier if you're looking at it uh you could take both the this exponent say okay this is now to the 10th and that's to the fifth that might make it actually a little bit easier but starting out you would see the Gen this I'm just making a point here you'd see the general power rule first do you see what I'm talking about you see the product rule first here it encompasses the whole problem and that's how you diagnose these things what do you do first whatever is encompassing the whole problem and then you work your way inside and you follow the DDX and the DDX will tell you what to do are you ready to do this problem let's do it so first thing we see okay connecting this thing is a multiplication that means a product rule set up the product rule so [Music] for so now this one the cube root of that is going to stay in with that function just do the product rule right now and we'll talk about the next part later just do the product rule and set it up don't take the derivatives yet to set up the product pool okay set up the product pool I want you to take no don't do the derivative just set up the product rule the product rule should say the derivative of the first time the second plus the first time the derivative second did you all were we all able to do that so this is what I mean by that the derivative the derivative of the first times the second is that the second no okay that's the second yes that three has to tag along with that piece if you're going to do the product rule where have you got that far so far okay good deal you have the exponent right then you do a plus and you do der first * second plus the first times the derivative of the second do you yes for us here's what it said this was the first function X and this was the second function X it was being multiplied right so you have to take those two just those two pieces that's what you were doing here I'm kind of crooked aren't I I'm always like that I think now we feel all right with this so far I'll try to be more straight on the next one now you follow the DDX and you just do what it tells you to do cuz that's your Calculus so just take derivatives piece by piece as they appear so piece by piece as they appear says can you take the derivative of this thing right there yes that's actually quite an easy one what's the derivative of that so this says all right two do I take the derivative of that Heavens no no it has no DDX do I take the derivative of this so I just write it and now we get down to this this piece notice how it's basically the pro R lets you break it up as problems within problems within problems none of it's going to get any harder than this it's just you might have more rules encompassing it so if you can follow the rules down you know the three rules uh the chain rule quotient rule product rule you know how to go from the outside inside just follow your DDX you'll be okay now that's easier said than done or I know some of these problems are very tasking but if you can do that that's the fundamentals here you look from the outside inside start with the big rules and follow the DDX and then use rules within rules within rules so on this one we look at this and you say can I do that piece that derivative it's basically a problem within a problem what's the derivative of x^2 - 5 3r what rule do you need for that chain rule or the cor to that because this is a specific version of the chain rule is called the what general power rule so this was a product rule and inside of that had a general power rule general power rule says well what I'm going to do is so for this piece for this piece what do I do so notice I'm here right now I bring down the three very good what do I have next please good I don't change the inside I don't change that to the what exponent oh don't forget that and then I'm done right okay times the derivative of the inside that's the chain rule that is the general power rule times the derivative and I want you to write it out I want to see this I don't want you doing the math in your head right now we're just learn we're just barely learning it okay I know that eventually some of you are going to be able to just do these in your head in this class for right now wait till you get to 4B to do that for right now I want to see your work that way if you make a mistake not saying you will but if you do I want to see where that's happening do you get me do you get me show me those steps okay uh times a derivative of x^2 - 5 remember that we're multiplying here are there any other ddxs to take care of hm yeah okay oh so yes we do we have a DDX what's the derivative of this little piece so if you follow that DDX down that tells you where to take the derivative of or what to take the derivative of so we're basically all done up until that point we have 2 x^2 - 5 3r let's not mess up any exponents 2x - 3 * 3 X - 5 to 2 time what is the derivative of that little piece notice how we kind of eliminated some of the bigger rules right about we use product rule that helped us down to just have one more rule left we had general power rule now we have just a very simple power rule and we're do together ra I feel okay with this so far your calcul this is over with now we're going to make it prettier by using a little bit of algebra and you're going to see something that happens often when you have have a product rule that involves a general power rule you're going to see some pieces that keep reappearing see how that thing appeared again with our product rule cuz you had the original and then you took a general power rule where that piece shows up again A lot of times that happens when you do the product rule and you have a general power rule you're going to want to factor that at the end it makes things a lot nicer so I'll show you what I'm talking about if we go ahead maybe make this just a little bit prettier we have this this becomes 6X like that are you okay with that so far yes no do you see the factorization what I'm talking about yeah we have this this big factor and this big factor right there we can pull out what can we pull out of that if I pull out the x^2 - 5^ 2 what I end with is two two still there x^2 - 5 to what power good because I pull out two of those things does that make sense to you plus 6X 2x - 3 are are there any of these left I factored that out notice you can get the same thing if you distributed this distributes and give you this this distributes and give you that so that that's factorization right there we feel with that so far the next thing you do distribute this in combine like terms if you distribute this in combine like terms you'll have a much simpler looking polom so in here we get our 2x^2 - 10 we get our 12 x^2 - 18x if I did it right did I do it right yeah if we combine some of those like terms I'm seeing 14 x^2 I'm seeing - 18x - 10 now hopefully it's not just me but this thing looks a whole lot more concise than that thing does it not it looks it looks prettier looks better looks more concise we're wrapped up and that's where we want to end our derivatives if we can make it that far show H how many people feel okay with what we we've done so far at least up to the calculus being done part are you okay with the calculus being done part after that just algebra manipulation that's okay we do that by the way this is the part where people lose track in this class what you're actually doing okay they just get to the they go oh yeah general rule and pro Rule and P rule train rule they lose track of what you're doing what did we just do we found the what slope found that's all we're doing to find the slope this is the slope this is the formula for the slope of that curve at any point that I want so could I still find that equation of a tangent line at a point sure I'd plug in the x coordinate to here to find my slope I'd plug my x coordinate into here to find my point then use y - y1 = MX - X1 that's all we're doing okay we're finding slope or if this is a position curve we're finding velocity or rate of change or if it's cost function we're finding uh marginal cost marginal profit things like that very interesting stuff let's try a few more I need to show you how the uh the chain is going to affect something to do with like a trig function and that will probably be about our day does the chain Rule still apply what do you think do I have a function within a function basically that's what you're asking because if if you do then you have a chain rule do I have a general power rule here oh explain that explain how I have a general power rule because I don't see an exponent right now so in order to do this well hopefully you remember this from the last couple sections in order to do the the derivative you really need to represent Roots as exponents right because we know we we deal with that we subtract one from them you can't subtract one from a square root unless you write it as a 1/2 so first thing to do is go yeah all right I know that this is 5x^2 - 1 in parentheses to the 1/2 power and that right there says aha aha look if you can cover it up you're talking about a composition within within parentheses you're talking about a composition that means chain rule applies in this case it's an exponent so the general power rule applies why don't you go ahead and try it go for it you're you're at that point at this at this stage remember I really don't want you doing the work all in your head I want to see the steps right now I want to see the DDX written out did you make it that far one 5x^2 - 1 to the2 cool inside doesn't change for now and then we take the derivative of the function itself the inside function our composition or the piece of our composition if we take that derivative then we're just about done did you get the 10 X2 how many got exactly that on our paper good for you now make it a little prettier here's how you can make it a little prettier the 1/2 and the 10 that simplifies that simplifies and gives you five so we have 5x and then we have this 5x^2 - 1 the2 how you can write that appropriately would be since you started as a square root you probably want to end with some sort of root we want 5x on the numerator 5x on the numerator 5x^2 - 1 and a square root on the denominator you see where why it's on the denominator firstly that negative 1/2 that moves to the denominator the 1/2 becomes positive that's a square root can I cross out the 5x and the 5x s oh heck no no no no no we can't do that all right I see that all day long andree but no we can't do that are you ready to move on from the general power rule because that's about all I can show you with that I mean it doesn't change after this if you can do these couple problems you're you're okay so far are you okay so far would leaving in an exponential form still be acceptable if it's given to you that way what I'm expecting most of the time is is I if I give it to you as exponents exponents are fine if I give it to you as roots change it back to roots can you do that derivative that would be what folks oh very good you're memorizing it fantastic can you do that derivative the answer is no not with what you know well actually yes because we just talked about chain but not what you knew before today the answer would be no but let's look at it do you have a composition going on in this which means can you cover up a piece of it and get some other function basically if I cover this part up if I say cover up the inside we're always talking about covering up the inside cover up the inside and say well let's let y equal cosine of U and U equals whatever's into my hand would that be an appropriate composition because if I let the U go in for U in fact x to the 4th go for U then I get that back again right well if we find our Dy du what's Dy du here ladies and gentlemen we just talked about it negative sign What U negative sign U and DX what's DX and we knew that Dy DX is dy du times du DX true true St this is sin U because that's dyd that's this time DX which is 4X Cub dyd D DX dyd * DX that's chain rule we just talked about that that's this right here what's the one last thing I need to do SUB why why do I need to substitute different don't want to end with us and X's we'll make it prettier but that's the one I want to talk about this will ultimately become -4x Cub s of X 4th that would be the derivative of that curve are you okay with how to do that we that 4X cub front notice what you can't do oh please goodness don't do this please don't please please don't ever multiply those that's an angle this is not this you cannot make 4X to the 7th if you do that I I'm going to burn your paper I burn it gone what homework I didn't see any homework from you I was just burn it CU it's embarrassment I want you do that just kidding I wouldn't burn it but I will go no with like five exclamation points underline it and scribble on it and stomp on it that's about it kick a puppy I'm not going to kick a puppy not that not that bad but are you okay with this here's what this says in English we'll stop here this says in order to do the chain rule with this type of thing you really don't need to show me this this is just the underlying word here's what it says in English well and a little bit a little bit of calculus it says if you want to take the derivative of a composition the derivative of a composition such as we just had right now here's what this said to do it says I want you to take the derivative look what it does please says take the derivative of cosine right what's the derivative of cosine negative negative sign and leave the inside alone does that look familiar that's exactly what with general power rle right there take the derivative of the outside function the the cosine in this case but then you just can't forget to multiply by the derivative of whatever the inside was and that's what this says take the derivative the inside and multiply it that's what we did with general power rule a lot of people do this they will give me they give me this all day long oh it kills me they say oh yeah answer is negative sign of uh 4X Cub I get that all day long see the common mistake that people would make to get that they go oh yeah der of cosine sign der of the inside 4X Cub is this right no because they have not applied the chain rule chain rule says you have a composition here you need to take the derivative of your function sure leave the inside alone then multiply by the derivative inside so this says you take I'm going to use a kind of combination of rules here or U sorry notation you take frime of X I'm sorry frime of G of x times G G Prim of X that's what you do derivative of the outside leave the inside alone times the derivative the inside and that's exactly do you see that over here do you see what that means for us here okay good derivative of the function times the derivative of the inside that's what we're doing how many people feel okay about what we talked about so far will start here next time with a couple more chain rules and then we'll keep on moving thing right so uh today we are practicing all we are practicing today is applications of the three rules that we talked about chain rule which includes general power rule the product rule the push rule that that's pretty much it uh what you know from the chain rule is this this says in English you take the derivative of the function leaving the inside alone and you multiply by the derivative of the inside if you can remember that for the chain rule you're good to go we'll start simply then I'm going to start building on some nasty looking problems oh my gosh and they'll take us maybe the whole board to do uh but you need to see them because your homework's going to be like that too okay I don't want to leave you hanging on on this stuff so we're going to do examples we're going to do examples pretty much all [Music] day okay s of 4X to 5th uh a couple questions for you first thing is this a product rule okay so product rues apply because this is a actually a function this is really a composition you know a lot of people really don't understand trigonometry they go oh yeah it's sign time 4X 4X 5th which is not really what we're doing right you can't take if I just give you sign that's meaningless that doesn't mean sign that means a sin right now if I give you sign with an angle that means sign okay I'm not going to write sin on your paper you're not going to write sin if you write sin without this you're sinning in math that you're sinning right you have to have this part you have to have something with it if you just have this that right that that's not signed by itself is meaningless it must have something to it so this is not a product rule what this is is a composition of two functions a composition of 4X 5th in the sign what that means whenever you see a composition as a chain rule will work if you can cover up a piece of it and you still have a function that means it's a chain rule you okay with that that's chain rule right there so if we use the chain rule the chain rule says this says in order to find dydx you're going to take the derivative of the function yes but you're going to at first leave the inside of it alone so what's the derivative everybody of s so we do the cosine yes do we take the derivative of 4X 5th right here that's going to stay alone that's that's this part okay that's the G of X that says 4X 5th this says you don't even change G of X and we didn't change G of x times ah the derivative of G ofx that's where you get the derivative of inside you don't match it all together you don't take this derivative and the derivative and put it right here that's not what you do this shouldn't be cosine of 20x to 4th that's not it you take this derivative later and you multiply it and I want to see it written out 4X 5th like that and then you take the derivative what's the derivative of 4X to the 5th that's where we're getting that from so we're going to have a 20 x 4th time cosine don't even need that times of 4X 5th that right there that's our derivative that was a chain rule so on the test you want to see bdx I absolutely want to see that okay the way I'm showing you things in class is the way I want to see them on your test because I'm going to grade each little part I'm look for this I'm going look for this right there's only two steps don't get lazy and not show me your steps you okay with that one yeah that's a pretty basic one we're going to start building them up now I'm going to start incorporating more and more rules so you can start seeing them you ready for it yeah yeah let's do this you know a really good note to write down here or at least think about you want to think about the rules that you're going to have to do before you start your problem uh mostly you think about the most encompassing rule here so when you look at this problem what does this actually mean what is the cosine 2 x 4 write it like that give yourself a chance of this problem instead of just leaving it like this maybe you write it as cosine X 4th squared that's what it really actually means there doesn't it we just take a shortcut and put that square there often times you okay with that so far now let's think start with our rules which rule encompasses the whole problem is it a chain rule is it a general power rule I see two of them right now what I'm going to use a specific I know they're both chain rows all right so we're going to be more specific than that which one is should we do first this part or should we deal with the two first two the two and what does that two say to do general power that's the general power rule now it is a chain rule but it's a specific chain rule it's like a correlated chain rule it's called the general power rule so what this says is I have if you can cover it up remember that it's a chain rule it's a specific chain rule because it has a power it says general power rule general power and then inside of that you're probably going to have a chain rule do you see the chain rule as well if we start with the the largest rule I'll say the largest because it's the one that comes as everything you start with that then you can follow your DDX but it's all about how you start you got to think about that first you with me so let's go ahead and do our our DDX uh what happens to this thing what are we going to do so this two down goes out front all right and I'm going to have what what's next come on tell tell me does this change for my general power rule so I'm still going to have a cosine x 4 uh to what power so do I need a bracket with a little one is this okay on how to get this and then I'm done now what x of just x to the 4 what's the derivative that should come next remember when you do a general power rule you cover the whole thing up right you go okay take the derivative of what's under my hand it says you move the two down you subtract one from it that's great and you don't change what's under my hand that's this part but then you have to take the derivative of everything that's under my hand do you get me so it's not just x to the fourth it's what the whole thing oh this is going to be brutal no no no not brutal fun tonight yes tonight re have you're okay with that so far you see where you you see why you have a cosine there you see why you have a coine there this one you do not change this one you take the derivative of the entire inside function that's how the general power rule AKA The Chain rule Works derivative of the function times the derivative of the inside but now you're done with the calculus up to this point now you follow your DDX and this has broken down your problem made a little bit easier can you take the derivative of cine x to the 4th what rule is that that's the chain rule the chain rule says you take the derivative of your function times the derivative of your inside that's what it says to do the derivative of your function times dtive inside so you tell me does any of this change okay times we'll take the derivative of cosine X 4th what's the derivative of cosine x 4 let's think about that it says you take the derivative of says derivative of your overlying function okay that's the that's the thing that you're composing into so derivative of cosine you need to take that first what's the derivative of cosine so I'm going to put that in a bracket because it's negative negative hey negative sign of what is it still X 4th or 4X Cub good because chain rule says you do this but you leave this piece alone for just a second you leave that alone in order to find the deriv of this you multiply by that so we're starting to build these rules on top of each other and you really got to be good at what rule comes first if you are then you follow the DDX and it's just fine but you got you got to find that first rule once you do that we said okay this probably should be written like this this says general power rule you bring it down you leave it alone you multiply by the derivative of the inside that's where we're getting that from you okay with that after that calculus done just just keep on writing it keep on writing it this DDX says take the derivative of this thing now this is a chain rule chain rule says I take the derivative of cosine got it but I leave the inside alone just like you left the inside alone here I leave the inside alone and then I multiply by the derivative of the inside that's where that's coming from where you out with that so far good all right we're almost done we only have one little teeny derivative to take what is it yeah you know what every time you do a step it makes it easier sometimes but every time you use a rule it breaks down in little pieces for you times what's that cool Sorry 2 cosine x 4 * sin x 4 * 4X Cub just make it maybe a little prettier up here little prettier would mean you have a negative you've got a 4X cubed and you have a two they're all being multiplied together you see the multiplication take that stuff together so this will be8 negative 8 x to 3r then the cosine or the sign and then the sign and that's how I'd like to see your problem after this is It's just algebra it's just putting a couple things together you have 2 * -1 * 4 that's your coefficient that's 8 the X to the third we typically like to bring that up front can you follow that yes no if yes great if not do you have a question about it guys are we here are we good my middle guys good people at home just kidding can't see you uh you guys on left what if I could see you they' freak you out wouldn't it anyway doesn't matter which order the sign the coine go in no that doesn't matter this is technically right right this is it so no matter how you because multiplication is commutative associative doesn't matter how you group up how you put in order we typically just write numbers and single variables first and then signs and cosiness it's just how we do it can we move on are you ready to move on to one similar Choice guess you just leave you're going to stay no no choice okay okay this is actually kind of a more friendly problem a little bit do you see why it's a more friendly of a problem if I had done this would it be a friendly problem no that would be your enemy if I did that what would you do first a chain rule they're both chain rules but a chain rule or a general power rule power that would be just very similar to that problem you would have to bring down the four all this to the third power derivative of the entire inside thing do you see it without the power without the power what are we talking about here CH that's the chain R just see the if you can cover something up and you still have a function that's typically a chain rule so we still have a chain rule right here it's not product rule that's not a product it's tangent of something that's a chain rule it's composition well let's do it what's how's the chain rule work what should we do first please I do what now Okay cool so leave this alone take the dtive of that thing so this says I'm G to oh tan what's tan very good Mak some flash cards know those derivatives secant squar does the inside change for us right now okay done no Noti can you tell me what the inside is here is it tan of this or just this just that part this is just a chain R it says derivative of tan see squ leave the inside alone then multiply by the derivative of inside that's what the chain says to do in English got it see squ cool inside doesn't change derivative of the inside that's the chain will it work not too bad what are we going to do take the just follow the DDX this is basically done you're going to get a secant squared but where people often forget to what people often forget to do is this piece of it they really often forget to do the chain rule they'll do this for me but they'll forget this part I can't have you forget that part that's a big part that's a really big part or they will do secant squar and then they'll take the derivative and just mash it together so if you're giving me this well that's that's not even nearly right you've changed the angle you you've messed that problem up all right that's not what we're talking about you can't just take derivative of this and D of that this is definitely a chain rule because it is a composition see the difference there okay so for us we go no no no no not that this is what is it oh yeah I just wrote it another question can I distribute that yes why can't you what is that it's an angle that's an angle It's actually an angle that's related to this oh no no no not this I mean this I thought you me dist these two can you distribute these two no negatory no no no this that's that's not an angle this is attached to that secant Square okay that's part of it you can't change the angle you can't change the angle what we can do is move this to the front so we don't distribute it um You probably wouldn't want to take this thing in and take the whole thing you wouldn't want to do that it's already factored for you nicely don't do that just leave it as 6 x - 2^ 2 3x^2 - 2x tell me one huge thing I'm going to Mark you off on for sure yeah for sure still okay yes all right ready keep going could we also put that one parentheses right yeah like that like that yeah you could it would be irrelevant but you could just keep EAS okay see now we're having fun no you know what I'll be no I'm not going to be nice um there great way to say thank okay I was just going to give you an X but I want you to see what happens so this will be a little bit more diff trust me you want the more difficult ones now that way your homework seems easier if I just gave you all the easy ones now your homework should seem like a bear so you want to do that okay I'm lost what do I do why why would you say a general power rule okay so chain chain rule general power same thing but we're going to say general power rule when we have the exponent so we can classify this a little bit better in our heads okay so if I say chain rule right now me I'm looking here I'm looking there so this I'm going to call that a general power rule for this class okie dokie do you see the general power rule at work see how it covers the whole entire expression so perhaps write it this way because we know in order to take these derivatives we've got to have exponent so far so good am I oh I amoot better much more better okay tell me what to do come on you guys should be rolling with this stuff at this point this should be like okay we're getting there not perfect but we're getting there what do we do good cuz this is general power rule right general power rule says bring it down write whatever's on the inside notice how we're not changing that the inside does not change for our chain rule which also includes a general power rule uh do I still have an exponent or do I just get get rid of that exponent do I still have an exponent here don't forget about that exponent man oh my gosh if you just move move down one2 you forget that that's a big deal because you've eliminated a square root on a denominator there so this this really needs that negative2 do you see where the negative one2 is coming from yes can if you do you feel okay with it now what do I do take that to R yeah take the d of the inside take the derivative inside so general power rule says bring it down subtract one just like you normally would with any power rule only now you have to multiply by the derivative of whatever you covered up whatever you ignored for a second in this case it's the entire expression so notice how before you start taking all these derivatives you have the same thing twice you see that same thing twice and then you I'm losing some of you you with me then you take the deriv of that little piece this calculus done just hang on to it for a while now let's look at the derivative of this nasty junk here what is the derivative of this thing can you take it a derivative piece by piece no is it okay when I'm adding subtracting do I need a Special Rule to take the derivative of x Cub not at all I can just do what's the derivative of x Cub beautiful so don't outthink these problems the only time you need special rules in when you have a quotient a product or a chain rule that's it so when you get this little piece this should be a problem within a problem now you look at this you go how do I take the derivative of x Cub no problem it's being added remember derivatives are separable by addition subtraction that's okay so I just take this and go oh yeah yeah yeah I do 3x2 not a problem that's fine can I take the derivative of cosecant X cubed can I take it directly or do I need a special rule for it do you see the chain rule here chain rule says sure it is cosecant but if there's something special in there besides an X that means a chain because that's a composition just like this one was just like oh what one just like that one was just like that this one was that's a composition you need a chain rule there if you just give me the derivative of cosec with X Cub or the derivative of cose with 3 3 x^2 you're not hitting the money on this class right you're missing the chain rule you're be missing some factors of X you miss a whole lot of stuff here so this is great sure now let's take the derivative of cose x Cub what's the Dera the train rule says take the derivative of cosecant so what's the derivative of cosecant let me change it to a bracket too negative cosecant coent of of what good because this says with chain rule you take this derivative great I just do that but you leave the inside alone for now would that be or is is it okay to leave oh yeah sorry did I forget oh I did forget that shoot I knew something looked funny thank you so this says when you do this cosecant is cosecant Cent so cosecant X was cose xent x what our X is is x 3r in this case so we go okay x 3 x the 3 now what what's the inside sure it looks ridiculous yeah I know that but can you do it do you see where it's all coming from how it's all fitting together is is it really really all that bad not really it's just you got to be careful really careful I mean the only the probably the hardest thing is memorizing cose you go hard thing here is D of cose NE cose Cent hopefully that's right is that right check your notes okay right CU here well general power rule sure we got that down calculus is done here derivative of this one's very easy 3x^2 D of this one that's chain rule this is negative cosecant Cent you do not change the inside you multiply by the derivative of the inside that's going to be 3x2 that's where we're getting 3x2 are you with me on this so far let's see if I have room for this stuff go right here SO2 all this to thetive one2 3x2 negative cose coent and lastly we have that little piece 3x2 hope that fit I think so sure now the 3x2 is that going to get multiplied with both of those terms the X plus you mean here and here right or it just with this right here ends a parentheses right there so that 3x2 this 3x^2 is not associated with the X Cub right so this does not get distributed to here this right here is 3x^2 plus this entire nasty looking expression okay that's what that is so when we try to simplify this just a little bit let's look what happens we're going to get 12 XB + c x Cub to the2 we're going to get a big bracket 3x2 doesn't change you don't distribute to that that was just a standalone small derivative 3x2 this we're going to pretty this up a little bit positive negative plus what's that going to be minus I'm going to move the 3x2 out front so this will be minus 3x^2 cose X Cub cang X cub and that's your grip that's pretty nasty can you follow it yes or no yeah or like there's no simply way can you would it be correct if you if you would go 3x^2 - 3 x^2 cose x Cub X Cub over sure I'm going to show you that right now so if you do want to put this back into this format this would be I mean like do you want us to or can we just leave it as that at this point it could go either way if I give it to you as a root probably make it back as a root it's generally the idea give it to his exponents leave to exponents um also one more thing if some of you guys want to get fancy with this and factor out 3x^2 you'd have 3x^2 * parentheses 1 minus that uh sometimes identities will help with that sometimes you can do identities a lot of one minus stuff when you have squares happens uh this thing I don't know if you can simp simplify that anymore or not um I because I made stuff pop my head but what you could do one last final thing would be [Music] this if you made it there if you can make it there that's fine for me that's great so we did General power rule we got it here's inside not changing derivative of the inside got it we're going to do 3x2 der this is a chain rule chain rule says cose xent X so we leave that inside Alone multipli by the derivative of the inside and then after that it's a little bit of simplification feel okay with this problem sure they're nasty yeah I get it they don't look fine but they're useful what did you just find yeah slope all this means is M slope M M for this I think I hate to be dealing with that gra oh yeah I don't even know what that looks like not a clue a little bit probably all squiggly lines all over the place don't know don't really care honestly you ready to keep going two more two more what you want to do first you want to do the hard one the harder one hard you want do the harder one yeah all right you asked for it we have three more actually last I that's not a good sign nope notice one thing please uh I could give this to you with a slightly different look check this out if I gave it to you like this would you verify that that's exactly the same thing you probably if unless you have a function of X up there probably shouldn't use quotient rule here if you use quotient rule this it's going to explode in your face paper no done it's not going to handle this problem need a special paper for that they don't sell in stores uh no do this okay unless you have a function of X CU you don't want to deal with that either if you had a function of X and you move this up top of you're talking about product rule you do that it's fine but that's just a constant move that up for me would you that and that way you just use a general power rule instead of a quotient rule quotient rule with this be ridiculous so verify that's the same then you can start looking at it so we're going to identify what we're doing on this problem I need you to see the pieces what's the biggest piece General power very good general power rule encompasses this whole entire problem now let's let's walk all the way through it within the general power rule after we do that we're going to come down to these two things right yeah what's the derivative of three Z that's great so we we'll be able to do that one nice and easy how about this piece what encompasses this just this is it product or chain product product encompasses the whole thing doesn't it yeah now within the product rule I'll take a derivative of x that's that's easy 2X and then I'll have to take a derivative of this little piece right here what what is this little piece that's a chain rule so we're doing general power rule we will have a project rule within that we'll have a chain rule within that okay it's nice to think about those things though nice to think of it just kind have like a a graphic organizer or an organizer for advanced organizer for your thoughts ready yeah two more yeah yeah but they're easier sort of sort of let's get to it come on you tell me what to do what am I going to do now good keep everything the same yeah negative -2 right you know how many mistakes I saw on your homework with that be careful I mean it would be so sucky if you knew how to do this stuff and you gave me -2 here right that would suck cuz I'm like oh you know what you're doing G no I don't do that it's four4 subtract one from that and then what now um now we multiply by thetive of the inside write that out go for the derivative the inside right now when we say the inside we mean the entire expression that you basically ignored so you should have that on your paper do you have that on your paper yes hey calculus is done here you're done with that we're just working on this piece over here let's take the derivative of this piece over here so this is -3 X2 Cent X2 all right -4 you're done with that piece times probably want a bracket you need a bracket big bracket lost St big bracket why big bracket well let's look at that uh derivative of three oh that's nice that's a nice one if it was just another expression we could have taken a simple derivative just like we did right here right right there so no problem this is zero I'm not even going to write the Zero D 3 is zero it's constant let's F focus on this one you said what happens here which is why we need a bracket because I'm sorry noct which is why we need a bracket because we're going to have an addition in there product means plus you follow so we need that bracket to organize that this says okay I'm going to have three's gone that was a zero so this goes to zero this says the derivative of the first times a second are you seeing how all the rules are coming back to haunt us or help us how you want to look at it uh plus or minus folks plus what finish this off you got to say it okay so X I'm going to do X squ first how I I like to do it derivative of cang x s finish off your bracket okay kot if you can head notot if you can follow that yes okay cool follow our ddxs here no ddxs here DDX here DDX -3 3 + x^2 Cent X2 to the -4 power big bracket derivative of x s everybody what is that well that's nice 2X Cent x^2 well we got that done plus I don't take the derivative of this X2 I simply follow my DDX x^2 tell me what happens here please what happens here what happens now I chain R for sure that's a chain rule do you guys see the chain rule absolutely chain rule we predicted it right we had general power rule product rule chain rule so we had that right let's go ahead let's do follow the DDX do that chain rule chain rule says here I'm probably going to have at least a parentheses to organize my thoughts a little bit you don't necessarily need it here because it's just a chain rule you're not adding or subtracting but it's kind of nice to have what happens with with that what's the derivative of coent is itose so I'd like it in parenthesis just because I know that's a negative I don't want to cons uh misconstrue that as a minus sign that's the only reason I have it here so negative cose squ of oh of what folks of what 2X or x s good and then we're done right oh there's one thing if you forget this oh it blows your whole problem up but if we don't forget it we have the problem right times what yeah I want DDX of X2 this is this parenthesis that's the bracket have five problems on our test I can give you one I can give you one problem and it would show you everything seriously I could I'm not going to but cuz if you got it wrong oh that suckes 20% of your grade suckers no I would't do that to you I might do that to you if I retiring just don't care anymore you no I would do that that' be worse than kicking no about the same level he kicking a puppy Okay so kick the puppy general power the Pu for you D to the inside product rule no problem chain rule we got it derivative inside right here that's going to give you 2X and we're done the calculus oops last step is just to organize this little p p over here and then we're good we're fine also if you wanted to write this on the denominator of a fraction you could all you could do that I'll show that to you as well so we have -3 all this junk this over here since we have all being multiplied together that's a negative that's a 2X and that's an X2 a negative a 2X and x s tell me what I write good again if you really wanted to get fancy you could factor out a 2X here and a 2X here you could do that if you wanted to uh you could distribute the three across this but not that because the exponent uh so one last thing you you might you might write it be all this stuff times the -3 that does not move it's not associated with that negative exponent all over that what we be good just one before it most cases yeah actually it depends on how I gave it to you if I gave it to you like that with that negative exponent like I originally did would be good that's fine right if I gave it to you like one over that I probably would expect you to go back to that so you see the patter pattern in it because if you see the pattern in it uh you can kind of guesstimate what these derivatives will at least look like CU remember how this was one over this to the third and now it's some crap over this to the fourth that fourth power and that doesn't come from nowhere that's still right there you have all this Jun associated with it how many people feel okay with what we talked about so far all right we start one more won't get all the way through it I have a question yeah you factor out the 2x right there yes yeah I was saying that you could factor out the 2X this would become uh 6X this would be cang x^2 this would be- x^2 cose s X2 okay and you could do that if you want to get fancy you know I'm just trying to survive all right two more two more maybe we'll just you know what we'll just talk about them I think you've had enough uh this is this is good enough we I'll put them on the board we'll talk about what they are and then uh you can do them on your own if you want answers to them maybe I'll I'll work them out and and give you answers at the very end of this thing uh just so you can you can see it on the board but for right now here's the problems I'll be doing and then I want to see if you can do them on your own just kidding just kidding that look s horrible do you see how horrible that would be you could do it though couldn't you couldn't you general power general power rule noer rule chain rues that would be that twice in there what's this one what's this one rule comes first yes for sure because that encompasses the whole problem within the quotient rule do you see the chain rules if you forget that that it's going to have a 2X Associated and it's going to have a 2X Associated that's going to affect your problem so quotient rule you write quotient rule first you work it piece by piece you do the chain Ru for each little piece that you come across and then you're done oh all over the bottom Square remember that I'm going to work this out for you uh after class and I'll have this on the video if you want to check your your answer try that one and see it so I will work that out for you the other one is this one I told you they were going to get a little easier a little easier what's this one cuz I I've given this on a test before and I have people give me this all day long 2x cosine 3 and I go I kill you I kill you not thatu Ru product rule First Chain Ru within that do you see it and you can handle that one okay we're going to stop there I'm going to work those out I'll have them posted in just a little while okay so here we go hang on just a second so we have qu rule chain rule here chain rule here derivative of a little piece derivative of a little piece the rest is just simplification this one here's the answer so I'll get out of the way uh pause the video and then look at it Cy that's okay 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 2.7:  Implicit Differentiation
so today you're going to learn something called implicit differentiation you see so far what we've done is worked with is explicit forms of equations let me give an example this right here when you have y equals that function in terms of X or you have one y its salt or equals some function of x such as y equals 3x plus or is considered an or maybe the 3x squared plus four is an explicit form of a function explicit means lies over here your X is over here you can solve for y does that make sense for you this is explicit means Y is given explicitly tells you exactly what Y it is on the other hand is this an explicit function is why solve for itself and then X's on the other side no as a matter of fact you see Y's mixed in with X's this is called implicit form implicit means yes there's a y there and you're going to say that Y is a function of X but it's not written as y equals so Y is still function of X it's just bound up in the problem that's what implicit means so this is implicit that an interesting thing is a lot of time not a lot of time some of the times we can make an implicit function into an explicit let me show you how in this example first thing we want to solve this for y I would probably factor out the Y I get 1 plus x equals x are you with me on that and if I divide by 1 plus X I get egg y equals x over 1 plus X and that's now explicitly written so sometimes I can change from implicit to explicit so if the Y is alone on one side that means it's written explicitly so explicit why alone on one side how about this wanna see if you kind of get the idea would you say this is implicit or explicit listen explicit next course it would have y equals implicit would have y's and x's all mixed up what's this one definitely could you solve it for y okay let's try we solve for y we're going to get y squared equals four minus x squared and how would you get Y that so so Y would equal the square root of four minus x squared true or false think carefully three or four what's wrong very good because when you take a square root you have to put the plus and minus right so here's what this says well actually what is this do you recognize the square root of 4 minus x squared and the negative square root of 4 minus x squared what are those know what I mean what shape on the graph is that what's this that's a half circle this is a lower half circle do you see this this is our two our upper that's a circle by the way radius of two centered at zero zero so this is an upper half circle and a lower half circle what that means is that implicit functions can often define two different functions our sorry implicit equations can often define two different functions this is not a function by itself because when I plug in one number I get out two answers that says it's not a function it's an implicit equation it's actually two different two distinct functions an upper and a lower half circle do you see what I'm talking about so oftentimes that's what happens implicit equations can define one more than one function of X just like I did here this is implicit that's two different functions so so far we know what the explicit means I hope we know what implicit means I hope that means bound up within that why still a function of X sometimes we can solve for it and change it from implicit explicit and sometimes an implicit equation will make more than one function of X now I have to consider this example how about this would you say implicit or explicit what do you think super input was another level super implicit it's like super whoa huh you agree that is implicit right okay good you understand that could you solve it for y could you solve her for y in such a way that's why by itself equals a function completely an X with no other X's I mean sure you could divide by 9x but that's still a y let me refresh it or what explicit means explicit means there's one wide it's a lone on one side everything else is a Texas can you do that here yeah try it try it if you want can you do it easy I love Mexico she can do it easily here no no you can't because the way you might do is to subtract this over subtract this over right but you need have 3y cubed minus 9x y you'd factor out a Y but you still left with Y squared in there right there's really no good way to get rid of that at least not easily so can you easily get this into an implicit I saw right in explicit form can you do it as there's no this this cannot be written explicitly if there is a way it's not going to be easy if that sometimes there is no way you can't write it explicitly for some equations now to keep in mind what we're doing here we're not doing basic algebra we're doing calculus and calculus involves derivatives right yes okay no we've been doing nothing that's hold on derivatives so here's a deal if this is implicit and I can solve for explicit I could take the derivative of that in fact that would involve a quotient rule right and this one I could actually take the derivative of the top function or the bottom function and be just find I've involved a chain rule or the general power rule because that one-half this one though there's actually no way that we're going to be able to get that as y equals something in terms of X with me what that means is even if you got Y by itself there's still going to be otherwise and here they're going to mess you up we don't want that so we have to have another method to find derivatives instead of just having y equals a function and X there's got to be a different way and there is and it's called implicit differentiation that's what we're doing today so we're going to talk about how we take a derivative of this thing without having to solve it for y now that's kind of interesting question right can you take a derivative without having at y equals yeah you can we're going to look at that today so for example it's not the calculus isn't hard the algebra might be a little bit but the calculus is not hard implicit explicit everybody what is that explicit would be y equals something is that the case this is explicit this is implicit this is implicit this is implicit unless it says y equals then it's not explicit what does this one again it's definitely implicit now we could actually solve this one for y do you see that we'd subtract x cubed we take a cube root it would be just fine you can find the derivative that way but what I'm trying to show you today is how to do this without having to do that by just solving this derivative or solving for the derivative without having to solve for one because of examples like that which we're going to do that so we could solve for y take derivative or we could use implicit differentiation here's the whole deal though in order to do this you must treat Y as a function of X because if you could solve it for y y would equal something in terms of X right so you have to treat it and that's going to be important here in just a second you see why in a bit you must treat Y as a function of X must realize function X you know how you can add something to do such an equation subtract something both sides equation multiplying by take exponent take a root pretty much do almost anything you want to to both sides equation as long as you do to both sides you know that right did you know you also take a derivative at both sides of the equation did you you do now don't you do anything to equations you want to pretty much a long long with taking a derivative you can do that so I could actually take a derivative with respect to my variable what's my variable that I'm dealing with here my there's two variables so how do you how you tell which one we're talking about Y as a function of X right so you can have this with respect to X so we're still treating X as our variable Y is a function of that variable that you just don't know explicitly you don't know exactly what it is you get the idea so Y is good y equals something we don't know exactly what it is because we don't want to solve for it we don't really care that much like this one you don't care that much you're saying okay I know Y is a bunch in terms of X and that's what we're dealing with here so we're going to take a derivative of X cubed plus y cubed and that equals what do you think 5 or the derivative of 5 derivative of both sides so we treat Y as a function of X that we simply just don't know we don't know what Y actually equals and we don't really care here's our steps then I've shown you the first one the first one is you're going to take a derivative or differentiate both sides with respect to X just make sure your dutiful decides it's an equation after all you have to do that so drive both sides let's check the X I'll start you off with the easy side the easy side is the five side let's start the five side can you tell me what's the derivative of five which is a constant very good if you leave it at five you see that would really affect your problem that would be a problem zero now let's look at here can we take the derivative of these pieces they're added together which means I can take them term by term you with doing this I'm glad you're here today this is something you really need to see now the derivative of x cubed is pretty easy to do we're taking a derivative with respect to X you fall down that in fact if I wanted to since that separable by addition I could do I'm going to show this to you one time we typically won't do this but I show to you here you could write x cubed derivative X cubed plus the derivative DDX of Y cubed okay with that so far right yes ma'am what's the derivative of x cubed with respect to X how much is that makes for a very good plus now this is the weird one what's our variable that we're taking the derivative with respect to two okay we're taking with respect to it says right here fun is that put that it's a Y now here's the idea y is a function in terms of X right so basically this is interesting I hope you find this interesting so you're saying what you have here is actually a general power rule you actually have that do you see it it really is this it's really that it'd be the same thing check this out it'd be the same thing as doing this 3x squared minus 1 to the fourth is this a function of X yes it's being raised to some power right and how you do this is actually the chain rule the special version the corollary which is called the general power rule you with me on this you bring down the 4 watch carefully I'm gonna draw the analogy right here you bring down the form if you find that it found the derivative you'd have one out 2/3 you groove this but then you don't end there do you I made it that wasn't evil like yet wait I have good ones I thought so easy we bring it down because that's a general power we'll bring down the exponent fact one from it derivative of the inside your this right you did homework on that I hope if you didn't well here's what you were supposed to do that we go that's it and you would get whatever the derivatives of that and you'd go 6x for that derivative right now look at the comparison this is a function in terms of X that was a function in terms of X this is raised to some power that was racism power so the derivative says this it says sure you bring down that exponent and subtract one from it this is no different than what you've been doing this is actually this right here are you with me the problem is this in this case you had to multiply by the derivative of the inside here do you see what I'm talking about what's the derivative of what's the inside here the Y so we multiply by D DX of what are you clear on that do you see the chain rule at work do you see that you need to see this before you'll any further raise your hand feel okay I'm getting that part of it she was coming from now here's the weird thing D DX of Y that says that says this check it out this is the derivative of Y with respect to X does not the derivative of Y with respect X this says the derivative of Y with respect to X but then so does this the derivative of Y with respect to X doesn't that say the same thing here and what does this represent that represents your derivative you don't get it you know the whole thing is no this is your derivative you get this that's the derivative of your Y every time you take a derivative of Y we were going to get a dy/dx because every time you take a derivative of Y you actually have a chain rule every time you have a chain rule you take a derivative of the inside of it does that make sense to you so every time you're going to have a DDX of why why this is the derivative of Y with respect to X right this is the derivative of Y with respect to X that is your derivative actually if you think about like variables it's kind of weird but D DX times y over 1 dy over DX I don't know if that really works but they're smoother than that you can do Y DX that's what these two things mean they're equivalent statements equals zero vision if you look at getting down that far so here's the whole thing for you you take it derivative of both sides with respect to X since you're treating Y as a function of X every time you take a derivative of Y every time you must get a dy/dx that's really the only important note for today if everything else which is say so each time you take a derivative every time you derive why you should have dy DX on account of the chain rule each time you drive why you must get a dy/dx on account of chain rule now some people might be asking well mr. Leonard why don't we have a 1 for this why don't we have to use the chain rule here well think about it think just think for say if we did the same thing you would do chain rule and you would get d DX of X right if you did the same thing that's DX over DX how much is DX over DX 1 doesn't matter right that's all we don't have to do that so for our dy DX so that is different this is not the same variable is y this is a function in terms of X which means you need the dy/dx there and that's the whole crux of implicit differentiation now the only issue is this stands for a derivative this whole thing is all mixed up together can you solve for this this was the calculus the algebra is the rest of it get this by itself and then you have your first derivative ok subtract this what another is this so you keep the keep the Y's the 3 y squared well for right now because if you multiply it so I'd subtract now we divide so now that's gone if we do just a little bit of simplification we get dy/dx equals looks like negative x squared over Y squared me can you make it down that far that's our derivative notice how our derivatives also implicit our function was implicit that makes sense our derivative most of the times will be implicit as well now could you have done this and got the same exact answer the answer is yeah but check this out take yourself if you did this explicitly so if you solve this for Y which is that which is that if you take the derivative of this thing are you going to get exactly this no because this won't have wiesen in this will however you can make a substitution how much is y equal to that you can actually substitute in and that will be the derivative there isn't that kind of interesting and they kind of cool did you see what I'm talking about take over your head right now hope none less far notice how if I were to solve it for y y equals this right some that Y is here so this would be that you can do which is the derivative if you would to if you do the strip tremolo see if I'm right pretty sure I am let's see if I am right see if you can derive that cute and yeah it's cute it's a cube root hey do that get your to the negative three halves power first our negative 2/3 powder that's going to be right here for you you're going to have your X squeezy x squared in there right the 3 is going to be gone because you have a 3 X square negative 3 x squared you have over 1/3 you cross those down you'll have a negative there's your negative you have an x squared is your x squared you have this thing showing up again to a weird power it is the same derivative it's just this one is not explicitly written this one is with this function you could do this so you won't be able to do this with your with your derivative in most cases because you can't solve for y so that's the the beauty of implicit is that this is just as valid as that is just as valid so we do this step one I used to learn one step always step to solve for dy/dx so write a step two on your paper somewhere step two is solve for dy/dx so to solve this okay guess what that's it that's implicit differentiation if you had this idea down you have the list of differentiation down now is it going to get tougher of course yeah because we're going to incorporate things like changeable things like the product rule things like quotient rule what you can all do it makes it Alex were nasty the calculus is not more algebra is yes difficult in some cases would you like to try some examples to see this thought you would okay let's take a look at just few of them first one I'll start off with is this one I say find dy/dx so if we want to find dy/dx that means of course we're implicit right here there's no way we're solving for y oh my gosh could you imagine solve that for y not a chance so when I can solve that for y that'd be ridiculous good thing we have implicit differentiation right now so Blissett differentiation says all right why don't you go ahead and take the derivative of both sides I want to see your work on the stuff show me your DD X's just don't forget both sides don't forget them now let's look at the right hand side that's going to be the easier to two in this case what's DDX of 4x to the 5th how much is that and so don't forget the stuff you already know how to do don't let that leave you now this is where we get to be kind of careful right if we have DDX of 3y squared plus sign 1 you know how to take the derivative of this place you know how to take the derivative where you're dealing with what idiom of X's or Y's hear what those are functions of X which means that when you take a derivative you will get a dy/dx are you clear on that every time you touch a piece of your function that has a y in it with a derivative you get a du by DX every time because of the chain rule I'm gonna stop showing you this right here this whole chain rule idea we're just going to do things like this check it out 3y squits a derivative of 3y squared 6 wide great 6y what did you take a derivative what did you then do a dy/dx the reason is again you would have a chain rule chain rule would say bring down the exponent multiply it take one away from it that's the 6y with then x d DX of Y right that's what we have over here d DX of Y but that is your dy/dx and that's where that's coming from he'll be ok with 6 y dy DX if knows you guys have questions on that right now this part is coming from the same ideas this right here it's the chain rule you bring it down you subtract derivative of the inside and that's what we're doing derivative of the inside in this case is d DX of Y that is dy DX that's that piece you need that piece otherwise you won't be able to solve for your derivative you're with me gonna have that so we need that Plus as we have a plus here what's the derivative of sine because I okay so we have cosine of Y dy D dy DX you took a derivative of something involved Y that means two languages again if you want to see this this would be the chain rule you go cosine of Y leave that leave the inside alone DDX of the inside but that's just a wash that's dy/dx why we're getting that thing that's where that's coming from do you see where it's coming from that's a good question let's solve for this and I'll ask you that I actually have a couple examples later on that will illustrate what you do for that so we're getting there right now I just want to get to handled on on the drill record of stuff okay whoo oh oh man what do you got to do now yeah you got to solve it so when you solve for a variable when you solve for variable you get all your variables to one side right then you try to combine like terms and you try to factor until you can just one of them and divide that's how you basically solve for a variable or a variable here is dy/dx so get all your dy/dx is to one side bass girls with your calculus is done you're done you've done the calculus correctly now it's algebra so you see your dy/dx here your dy/dx here that means you're going to factor so you're going to be good at factoring if you factor that out you get a 6y plus cosine y equals 20x - 2 4 so far so good let's get rid of this nasty piece of junk what are we going to do with that just to buy it this is being multiplied correct so if we divide both sides by that so divide here divide here we're dividing by this expression we get dy/dx equals 20x to the fourth cool over this same expression 6y cosine one is it really too hard not really not too bad they don't get harder when we start doing some other rules in there which are about to start right now and you see that but in general they how this is going to be very similar very similar stuff you've done as long as you remember what what's the important piece of information here yet ever dy/dx that's the important piece information practical application do we have if we're trying to find like the perfect music with for a circle why why would you want to find the top half turn of the bumper circle and the box well if you mean those things exist in your life right so if we somehow need to find a tangent line of those you can do it so we can actually find tangent lines to these weird curves which aren't even functions not functions we can still find rumors of that it's going to come back at you later in calculus to for when you have more than those variables right so you're going to have use for this later on as well translate that's your fiction is it pretty something where you have a multi variables and you're holding one constant you trying to solve you can you can actually do partial derivatives things like that I don't know if that's I think that's the same thing isn't explicit if you use that in that context and I'm sure but I do know that this is useful for finding those derivatives and the slopes of just in fact if you really think about it funny a trivet you want you've been doing this whole time if I give you an explicit derivative or X or some function y equals rigged square any of you sometimes if you take the derivative of both sides which is actually what you've been doing check it out you have DDX of y equals d of 3x squared minus 4 now this sense is a function in terms of X or 6x this that's a function in terms of X in it derivative gives you dy DX you've actually doing the whole time you've been doing implicit it's just been nicely solved for you the whole entire time that's kind of neat right so is their applications for implicit differentiation yes because you've been doing this entire time implicit just comes about because sometimes you can't solve for what and that's why we have it still be the same thing still a derivative just you cannot solve that for one good question are you ready to move on are there any other questions on this before we do our ufi yet and then kind of cool all right I think it's cool no no that's later I'll get that for ya no no that's this chapter coming up don't worry see look simple look simple example why do I have a pulse huh implicit explicit what was this definitely implicit because the Y's not my self can you take an implicit derivative of this what is y a function of X what happens when you take a derivative of X which is a function of x times y which is a function of X you see the product rule kind of bug so what we can't do and you just go oh X is one y is dy/dx da have done because then dy/dx would equal 1 right and that's that's not the case in fact if you ever solve this what you're going to get is negative 1 over x squared that's what that is because if you divide by actually one of our extruder that it's next to negative 1 power bring that down subtract one from it you get negative 1 over x squared you see that on top that's got to be the same derivative so here when you have the product rule yeah you got to use it that's a function of x times a function of X so sure we're going to take a derivative of both sides and you let your your DDX kind of do the work for you just follow that down DDX of one what what's D DX of 1 0 so don't forget about that you always take the derivative of both sides D DX of X times y and that's a function of x times a function of X and that implies the product rule so we go okay let's do derivative of the first times the second plus the first times the derivative of the second once you help me out with this folks you tell me what's the derivative of X with respect to X good and what else do I have why do I need a dy/dx here did I take the derivative of Y then no you don't need it plus I know this X doesn't change what's the derivative of Y with respect to X yeah that's kind of nice right can you solve for dy/dx are you ok I'm getting it for okay solve for dy/dx what do we do subtract I so X dy/dx equals negative 1 goodbye my ex because that's being multiplied right now if you divide by X you get dy/dx equals negative Y over X now I made you the guarantee that this is going to be 1 over negative 1 over x squared and this is not negative 1 over x squared this is negative y over x squared why is that well because I solve this derivative by using implicit if I had made this exquisite which you could do easily that's 1 X true white is 1 over X if I plug in one of Rex well I get negative 1 over x over x over 1 flip it reciprocate you're going to get negative 1 over x squared which is the same exact derivative that's the same thing now this is one of the rare cases where you could make your implicit function into explicit and do the same way I'm just giving you this as a kind of a for instance that when you see this you need the product rule like can you see the product rule here okay so do you need to do this no no no you know this is a valid answer when you're doing implicit this is just fine this is what I'm looking for as a matter of fact so don't forget what the plug for you've got to see the product rule well I don't know if this is fun or not it's fun for me I love this stuff but do you understand it is really the main thing it's what I care about whether you find the fun honestly I don't care I would hope you do but I care that you get it do you get it after the practice yeah oh be a boy yeah yeah I don't expect you to get this out on the first go I mean if you do great and you're able to do all of them sure but yeah there's going to be some tough ones in there you are going to have to Frank I also need to show you this on can you could you could you take the derivative of that hey why don't you practice that right now go ahead by the derivative find dy/dx do you need a product rule for this problem thankfully I know okay so that becomes 6x that becomes to live did you get the dy/dx if you lose the divide e^x you get lost on the problem right because then you don't have a derivative solve for and you're like what am I supposed to do now is make any sense at all so you have to have those dy/dx is that stands for your derivative did you make it that for everybody helping show again something way that for good okay now we solved for solving Ford says well actually it probably nice if I added this to both sides and divided by 2y but I'm guessing most of you subtracted 6x and divided by negative 2y you still get the same answer but if divided by negative because that doesn't matter negative 6x if we divide by negative 2y you're going to get positive did you get positive 3x over why yes everybody great now unfortunately this is not the question I'm asking you for that's the question I'm asking for okay a second derivative now can you take a second derivative this thing of course you can but in order to take a second derivative yes you have to solve for the first derivative so well to do it correctly you have to solve for the first derivative so we solved for first derivative the second derivative just says hey check this out this kind of neat why don't you just take a derivative of both sides so go ahead and and do that can we take a derivative both sides watch how how they accomplish it if we derive both sides we get D DX dy/dx equals D DX 3x or what can we start with the easy side first first easy side first I took a derivative of the derivative gives you a second derivative and you're going to see the notation coming to play do you see this like it how many deeds you have to D so d squared Y remember where that comes from okay cool over the limit doesn't work is this D don't get d squared x squared really should if you wanted to do that it should be like that we just never show that this becomes d x squared and that's where you get the notation for a second derivative are you seeing where that notation is kind of coming from it's cool I guess if you're me it's cool I don't get out much what are you going to have to do for this use a push rule go ahead set up the quotient where you know the quotient rule now go ahead and do it just everywhere it's easy it's an easy derivative just everywhere you see a derivative of Y you have to put 2 uy DX don't forget that and then you're fine I'll make it sound so what you'll see when I'm doing it I said then you're fine Oh before then yeah use the quotient rule set that up everywhere where you take a drinkable Y in the you dy/dx what'd I tell you do low D high minus high D low ok so low D high minus high D low again not to be confused with CeeLo blue CeeLo is gathered glasses on the voice very cool show my bedroom all over bottom squared I guess I could use parentheses there as well did you set up the quotient rule correctly so that stuff's not going to change I've taught you I told you there's only three rules I've touched all three rules now is justify them so do I put it do I take the derivative that Y so this is going to be Y times do I need dy/dx for this one for this one no because I'm not taking different one that's going to be three minus three x times what's this going to come to my white and there it is perfect y squared that gives you if we clean this up just a little bit 3y minus 3x now wait a second this is weird because I have a derivative and I have a group that's strange do I want to solve for that no no the reason why you don't want to solve for that look at the board have you already sold for how much is that equal to okay just plug it in so you're going to find dy DX's but if you take the second derivative you will have already solve for dy/dx that's cool now chances are for you guys you might not always get it like this all right if you if the back of the book looks different than this what they probably did because you have complex fractions they got rid of that why if you want to get rid of easily here instead find a common denominator just multiply everything by y and that to get rid of it so multiply Y multiply both by Y you're going to get 3y squared minus 9x squared over Y key you see we're talking about that should be the same thing as many common would you markusrohner the testicles you know I'm not sure off to think on that I would like it as simple as possible now it's sometimes your any some nasty things and would take you more time than than that so either I won't give you stuff it's going to be really nasty now you sit like this that you can simplify pretty easily or I would say just okay now I'm going to come back and answer your question here the question is what in the world does this stuff mean what are we doing here are we still finding derivatives and what is it derivative me well you have those words backwards metal yeah kind of so do you mean the slope of a point no not really some of our curve at a point yes so if I say here's Y squared minus X plus 1 equal 0 definitely an implicit equation can you find the slopes of that curve at two different points find slopes at 2 negative 1 & 2 1 notice something interesting that happens to this because I have something that's not actually a function it's implicit unplug it in the same x-value I'm actually getting out 2 y values you see that also notice that I am implicit which means I have to give you both x and y for you to accomplish this problem because your derivative is going to be in terms of both x and y you see it so that's how you use this now let's go ahead and end this problem real quick this is a pretty easy derivative if I derive both sides I'm going to get DDX to the left side equals DDX on the right side start with each side what's the derivative of 0 please good derivative of Y squared perfect - how much 1 plus come with a good derivative here is 2y dy/dx through here is 1 derivative here nothing can you solve that if you add 1 you're going to get 2y dy/dx equals 1 if you divided by 2y you get dy/dx equals 1 over 2y what did you just solve for what is this thing what is it that's M yeah that's it that's look that's what that is so this is a slope function now it says find the slope at 2 negative 1 & 2 1 is there a place to plug in the X not even a place to plug it in I don't even care about that plug in whatever values you can if they had both X's and Y's you plug in both X's and Y's bez only X's plug in X is that's wise well you're wise so what we're trying to find is a slope add to negative 1 four to negative one I would have 1 over 2 times negative 1 4 to 1 and 1 over 2 times 1 this one gives me negative 1/2 this gives me positive 1/2 interestingly here's what they've done we found the slope of that thing at the two points so two different slopes because we're going to have two different outputs for that same input interesting question how many people are so we talked about so far today ok I'm going to start you off next time with quite a brain buster after that we're done there's really one more problem that we have to do so I want to show you a couple things about that now what's R on the next time alright so today like I said we're going to continue talking about implicit differentiation that's what we're doing we're still finding a derivative but we're realizing that we can take this implicitly so if we can't solve our function for y like that which this is actually equation not a function but if we can't solve it for y that's called implicit so this is definitely an implicit equation where you don't find the derivative which still means slope of that thing so here's the question the question is not just this but can you with this equation finds the tangent line at a certain point find the equation of the tangent line at the point two one by the way with something like this could I just say at X equals 3 or X equals 2 could I have done that here now really if you can't solve for y because even if I plug in the the two you'd have a bear of a time find out what the Y would be does that make sense so really with these implicit ones they're going to give you the full point we're going to say that the derivative as well so let's go ahead let's find the equation of tangent line at that point what do you need to do to find the equation of a tangent line good because for any line you need two things one of the two things you need to find the equation of the line slope and a point we have a point we now just need a slope a slope is a derivative so we're going to go through this I want your help with it but I'm going to do it on the board for the sake of time just so you see one more time the implicit stuff I've already taught you how to do all that so right now it's really just practice for you and when one thing you're going to see if it's very important as far as our signs goes so with the implicit differentiation says you take a derivative DDX of both sides and we treat Y as a function of X what that means is Y is a function in terms of X that we just don't happen to know so if we're taking this with respect to the variable X and Y is a function of X we're going to get a dy/dx every time we touch a Y with the derivative does that make sense to you so we're going to be getting that so in our case well here's all the works shown for you we're going to take a derivative of both sides even though that's a zero I'm still going to show the derivative just for the sake of well-being correct and so you don't forget that even if it's constant or something you should have take a derivative that so we're taking a derivative of both sides of course a derivative of zero is still zero so we're good on that now let's look real careful at these pieces over here is this F our derivative take the four to the fourth what's the derivative of 4x to the fourth ok so let's do that so we got that that derivative how about this one is this one different for us that's a project why is it a product rule sure so this is a function in terms of X right there that is an X now we said Y is a function of X as well so every time you get that you do need product rule or if you have a fraction you would need the quotient rule so you have to have that so in our case right here we do have a plus so we write a plus now there's a couple things you can do with that 8 you can treat it as 8x squared that's one term or you can pull the 8 since that's a constant you can pull that out front that really wouldn't matter now you're probably going to be distributing that anyway so leave it in there with the 8x squared that's fine but you could you could pull it out DC I'm talking about that's possible so here I'll just treat it as 8x squared that seems to work ok for me so derivative the first times the second plus the first times the derivative of the second by the way note that even when I'm taking a derivative of Y I still have a DDX do you guys see that I still have the DX you can't go switching variables so if you have if you start with the DDX it's got to be that all the way through all right so that's there no matter what still okay so far so we've just done the product rule you know what I'm going to do since this piece was right here just for you say something why do this and next one just for the sake of being have a cut and continued continuity in the way I'm going to do things here I'm gonna put a big bracket around that that's saying this came from that one term and that's a great thing to do the reason why it's a great thing to do you're going to see this in the next piece if you do if you do this here it really doesn't matter because that positive isn't going to change any signs you see I'm saying however what's going to happen if I don't do that with this one I'm going to really blow my problem up okay that's going to explode my problem because the sign is going to be incorrect you're going to see that right here let's look at the next term I have a minus sign so I'll write of minus 25 x squared Y that's still a product rule product rule says maybe take the 25 with the x squared d DX of x squared that's a trivet of the first sorry derivative of the first times a second plus the first times the derivative of the second and once you see something now when this said take the derivative of this piece it means I'm going to subtract the derivative of that piece the derivative of this piece isn't just this thing is it it's the whole thing so if you don't have a big bracket right here that signs it correct right if you do have a big bracket right there that's saying that what's going to happen is this negative is going to change those signs in there and that would be the correct way to do it how people see that okay that's an important thing that's actually why we did this example just just so you can see that otherwise you're going to be off by a sign somewhere and then that's a good place for plus plus let's do this piece what's that piece okay I'll give you a 16 y cube we do we need to do Y DX on that every time you touch a Y with the derivative you have to have a dy/dx on account of what rule is that it did that general power rule or in general the chain rule that's right the chain rule says that equals zero now that's a long problem did you think you'd ever get problem that long that's ridiculous and it's like a whole paper right there are you okay on what we've done so far so we've done real easy one no problem pluggable product rule dy/dx because we're touching away with a derivative and if we have zero yes no now we start following the DDX this is why I made you write the DDX on your problems because it will tell you what to do next it says this piece is done you're just going to have the 16 X cubed plus now this piece in here this just says do this DDX so every one 8x squared what's the derivative of that and then it's y squared notice there's no dy/dx because I don't need one here this is just the derivative of X plus I'm getting rid of my bracket because I know none of those signs are going to change everything was positive that's okay so this plus doesn't change that's where those brackets are disappearing too then plus I have ax squared tell me the derivative of Y squared please when I'm taking a derivative with respect to X what is that good - Y but not just to Y right if I do two if I just do to why you know what happens if I do this and I forget a dy/dx what's going to happen is you're going to be adding and subtracting this term over instead of dividing by that term because you factored out a dy/dx do you see that the difference there that's going to really make that ending fraction which we're probably going to get look really weird so it's really important to get that dy/dx because that gives you another term that you're going to factor dy/dx out of - okay let's see about here the derivative of this this guy and then I have a Y now when I've already gotten rid of this bracket are you guys who can do it a couple pieces at once we get rid of this bracket what's gonna happen to that so this isn't math magic right I'm not Harry Potter gone no more pleasure to swap off a halt no and what's happening is I'm getting rid of bracket by distributing to these pieces notice the bracket ends here that - won't affect this + but it will affect this + so 50 XY plus our sorry - 25 x squared + the derivative of Y everybody very good then I'll have a + 16 Y cubed dy/dx equals zero give a little quick head not if you're okay on this so far yeah okay oh my gosh Wow what now well done yeah I see what you were no not even close well okay if it's done give me the slug then because we want the equation tangent line this is our goal right this is not our goal get all the right hands from one side brilliant yeah if we get all our dy/dx terms on one side then we can factor that if you get everything else on the other side that's great because ultimately we'll be able to divide follow so let's get all of our dy/dx is low we'll leave those on the same side and then we're going to add or subtract our terms depend on their sign to eat them over so we will be subtracting our 16x cubed our sixteen XY squared will leave this one alone so we want to leave this guy right here will be getting rid of this one we want to leave this one with the sign and leave that one by the way are you okay that I'm going to make this 16 x squared Y you're out with that too so notice that this is 16 x squared y dydx make a little bit nicer looking so 16 x squared y dydx that's that one so I got that minus 25 x squared dy DX I got that one plus 16 y cubed dy DX I got that one equals well we have to add this and subtract these two so you can write this in whatever you want it really doesn't matter we're going to have these three terms on the other side the signs will look different because we're adding or subtracting them so if I add this over I get 50 X Y if I subtract these two I'm going to get minus 16 X cubed minus 16 XY squared are you still okay so far okay great dy DX's are all on one side everything else is on the other side what now let's factor so if i factor dy DX notice how when we did this every term as it should as a dy/dx in on the left hand side well factor that out means divide everything else I'm a big bracket and now we have dy/dx times this enormous factor how do you get rid of an enormous factor being multiplied by some dividing you can divide by this entire expression right here that entire factor is going to go under this expression on the right hand side not mess that up so dy/dx is this thing all over that thing okay quick show of hands how many people were able to follow that pill okay with it by the way did I do it right okay okay because I haven't had to do anything all day so this is my first actual teaching class on my brain silver rusty so hopefully I did all that fight or maybe I'm extra good today because I had to waste my time on those stuff oh you're getting extra your lesson today I like that book okay so we have this by the way you should try to simplify this if you can factor and simplify now you're seeing an X here but you can factor out but there is not an X comment all through those terms so it really wouldn't help you in this case also you look for any constants to factor out you really don't have you have a two here but not a two there so there's nothing really much that we can do do you see when talking about what did we just find slope the equation for the slope the formula for slope now we said find the equation of the tangent line at that point do you have X's and Y's they give you X and one look at this this is the slow honey that's so it says plug in the numbers and find the slope and I have no idea what it's going to be so okay do this correctly things me nasty though looks horrible I give up this way for you I get to 100 over 66 upgrade I don't know what I got yet I got briefed I don't have a calculator shame on you did you without a calculator awesome awesome no really nice is that weird you're like I expect negative 1257 over like a third well if you put all this and you think this is a hard question it's really not this is the easy part this is a hard part let's find the slope because once you I mean if you talk about slope a slope has to be a number right a slope s of line has to be a constant number so plugging in Bank a constant number now this is very easy Y minus y1 equals M X minus x1 you get Y minus 1 equals 3x minus 6 and the 1 is your answer Jaffee this doesn't come about it all right oh by the way don't plug this in the end not the right way to go use that tip under slope does it make sense to you so this is about the hardest derivative I've ever really seen for implicit unless I threw a quotient rule that you have within that some of them are harder but this is good if you can do that you're fine okay do you do that and one that involves a quotient rule you're fine I think I did give you one of those earlier in our lessons so refresh your memory on that should be the second derivative of something I think we did that showed you how to plug in that dy/dx set this ends our implicit different differentiation are you okay with the idea of implicit differentiation uh no loopy murder I mean civil I told you before the Senate very very hard he's on his own so am I gonna give you a problem that takes you 45 minutes doing a test maybe they won't do that to you unless I just give you a test that has one problem on this I feel a great advise and say this is your final congratulations haha is it that you drink my coffee but I probably would wouldn't you probably won't do that but you want to roll it out either probably greater than 50% chance that I won't do that anyway ji-sung idea of implicit differentiation now what's kind of cool is that we can use this idea of implicit differentiation to take a derivative of whatever we want with respect to whatever variable we want and that's a weird idea but here's how we can use it I'm going to introduce the idea of something called a related rate these are all word problems I know some of you have a just it's the bane of your existence or word problems if you think through I'll give you some steps on how to do these and they shouldn't I can't of course I can't give you an example of every type of word properties lots of word problems but what I will do is give you a technique on how to do these when they write problems are you ready for it so if I'm at 2.8 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 2.8:  Related Rates
related rates what we're talking about in related rates is how to relate a formula to its change according to time it's change according to time um for instance how is cost changing according to Time how is profit changing according to Time how is a volume of something that's expanding or shrinking changing according to time so uh how what's the volume doing at EX actly 3 seconds is it expanding is it uh decreasing at what rate is it doing that that's what we're talking about here does that make sense to you so I'll I'll give you like an introduction here this is basically relating a formula with time that's what related right to mean for us relating a formula with time here's an example we're not going to work all the way through this example I just want to give you the idea on what's Happening Here and and then we'll start with some simpler ones I'm going to this kind of weird I'm going to start you off with one of the harder examples and then we'll make it easier okay just so you see the idea first let's say that I have this cone that's my cone here and what I'm doing is this cone is underneath a a faucet it's my faucet okay and and water's coming out of it it fills it up to a certain level and then we take and we cut the cone right there so the water starts coming out so maybe this is like a uh some sort of a a water container for a city a huge con usually they're probably cylinders but let's just pretend it's a cone it's same idea would apply for a cylinder but it's going to fill it up to a certain level and once it gets to that level maybe it opens up and that's our idea for this this idea for this related rat problem so after a while I'm going to have some sort of a level of water here true and of course that water is going to be as soon as I open up this bot I I shut this off I open up this bottom and start leaking out so probably pretty fast at first whatever whatever that takes place it's going to be leaking out somewhere now our cone has a couple of Dimensions to it what do you need to know to find the volume of a cone because we're going to talk about volume here in just a little bit okay we do need a height for the cone I heard height first yes that's a height and the radius of the cone is probably pretty important so you got height and radius what I want to do is find the rate of change of the volume of the water with respect to time I know that's a it's a horrible sounding question right find the rate of change of the volume of the water with respect to time that's our idea well here's our issue U does the water fill the whole cone up so that H and that R if you think about this the H and the r stood for the whole cone right if it were filled up that would be the the waters H and R as well however as we lose water what's happening to the H sure and the r is also decreasing as well right so at certain times this is going to have different radiuses and different heights and therefore a different volume volum of water so we're going to be able to I'm going to show you how to do this we're going to be able to find out um how this volume of water is changing at any given moment in time so here's what what you need to do the first thing is find a formula that relates what you want to talk about so basically what are we talking about the rate of change of what so we need a volume so we need to know the volume of a cone first so it starts off quite quickly it says find me the volume of a cone now do you know know the volume of a cone do you know the volume of a cylinder oh boy do you know the area of a circle okay okay let's start there that's the area of a circle right notice that a cylinder is just a whole bunch of circles stacked on top of each other for however much the height is so a area surface area of a circle is PK r s therefore the volume of a cylinder is PK R sare time the height to find the volume of a cone you cut that in thir so it's 1/3 Pi r^ 2 H or p 3 r h now here's the deal um this relates what we want it to relate look at the board it relates volume with the radius and the height that's all of our measurements up here are are you agreed on that you got to have that for a related rate problem but the the other problem is is there any time anywhere now here's how we're going to use implicit differentiation to our advantage you can take a derivative of this equation with respect to any variable that you really want to now some will make sense well we're going to take it with respect to time so we're going to implicitly derive this formula with respect to time because that's what related rate does says with respect to time so find a derivative with respect to time implicitly why can we do this why is this allowed for us to do well think about it is volume changing according to time is the radius changing according to time is the height changing according to Time all of those things are then functions of T functions of time just like y was a function of X in our earlier implicit differentiation problems all of these are now fun well pi over 3 is not that's a constant but h and r and v are all functions in terms of time so we can do that but you just have to be careful because since these are all functions of time do you remember that when y was a function of X you had to take a and put a dydx after everything because it was a function of X now every one of these variables is a function of time so we're going to have a d whatever DT after every one of them because they're all implicit functions of time notice how none of these are solved for T right I can't say h equals this t v equals this t r i can't say that so I can't solve them for T explicitly so I have to treat them implicitly just like we did in the previous examples you're going to see this in just a moment so we can do this because V R and T I'm sorry VR and uh H sorry are all functions of time so we're lucky that implicit differentiation was such a good lead in to this uh so let's let's go ahead and do that we'll take the derivative implicitly of the of both sides so when we took an implicit different uh derivative we did a DD something of both sides to start off with right so this would be a d d DD what t t why T yeah what D DT stands for is a derivative with respect to time or in other words it gives you the listen carefully the rate of change according to the time does that make sense the related rate the rate of change the related rate of change because a derivative is a rate of change according to the time so DDT sure of the volume equals equals well DDT of that entire right hand side as well let's start with the easy side easy side's the left hand side what is uh DDT of V what's it remember V is just a single variable what's the derivative of v it would be one but then you have the chain rule why do you have the chain rule here because is v a function of T so just like y was a function of X and you did a Dy DX V is a function of T so look what this says this says the derivative of V with respect to T this says the derivative of V with respect to T V is a function of T so you have to have that it's implicit it's the implicit way to write sorry it's it's stating that V is a function of T you have to have the dvdt here's what this says in English this says this is how the volume is changing with respect to time that's the rate of change of the volume does that make sense to you you see why we need that dbdt it is an implicit derivative now on the right hand side uh Oh what now oh explain why I need a product rule because two separate functions okay so what are my variables over here are each of those a function in terms of T yes I said all of them were so if we're taking this with respect to T that's a function in terms of T that's a function in terms of T and they're being multiplied that means a product rule how many people see the product rule there okay let's do it m you said the prodct rule um you can do it one of two ways you can take the pi 3 out or you can associate with one of the variables it really doesn't matter I think I took it out I don't I don't know why but it really doesn't doesn't matter for for okay let's see when you do this first derivative this part is going to give you 2 R 2 R what else do I need besides the 2 R oh besides the H I need drdt did you guys all have drdt it's implicit so you have to have not only 2 R but and not only the H but you're going to get a actually you know I'll write this way so you see it this gives you the 2 R Dr DT time H that's this piece right here that's what that gives you then the plus this is going to give you r s sure what's the dhdt what's it going to give you D dhdt CH hands how many people got 2 R drdt and then H and then the r s dhdt do you all get that as well so if we pretty this up just a little teeny bit I'll probably put the H in front of the drdt just because that's like that's how we like to write it so 2 RH drdt plus r 2 dhdt now if you didn't pull out the pi over 3 you have a pi over 3 here and you have a 2 pi over 3 there is it any different no it's the same thing what I really want to you look at we're not going to actually do an example of this one I wanted you to get this idea down but here's the here's what we would have to know in order to figure this out if I said what's the how is the volume changing or what's the rate of change of the volume at and inserted this this question to you I'd have to give you a lot of information you see we would have to know not only the r at that time not only the H at that time not only the D we need to know the drdt so we' have the r we'd have the r that's the radius we'd have the H we'd have that height but we'd also need to know what well we need to know drdt what is Dr DT sure but what's it mean change in the radius over time the the how the radius is changing with respect to time does that make sense it'll either be growing or falling depending on whether we're putting water in or taking water out uh but the the radius will be growing or shrinking so we need to know the rate at which it's changing for a moment of time we need to know that that will tell us how the volume is changing in a moment of time we'd also need to know dhdt what's dhdt stand for yeah how the height of our water is changing with respect to time is it going up is going down what's happening to that we need to know all those pieces what the radius is currently what the height is currently that would give us the actual volume but to associate how the volume is changing that's where we need the change in the radius and the change in the height how people kind of understand the concept of our our da our uh related rates now we're going to go a little step backwards and kind of start simply and we're going to build up to problems like this are you ready for it but if you understand this you understand the concept so let's start off real I'm not even to give you any any background on this I'm just say here's an equation find dydt and here's what this implies it implies that Y and X are both functions in terms of T just like this was okay it implies that Y is changing according to time and X is changing according to time are you with me on this so they're functions in terms of T at T = 1 why don't you go ahead and do this real quick for me take an implicit derivative because this has to be implicit Y and X are in terms of T right now it's got to be implicit take an implicit derivative with respect to T right now for me there's no hard project rle there's nothing about this so DDT of y equals DDT of X Cub notes taking to respect to T because we want to figure out what happens here at dydt and at tal 1 so uh what's this side going to become for you on the right hand side I get 3x squ right and that's it y DX DT look look it I know we have an X up here but are you taking it with respect to x no you're not you're taking it with respect to T implying that X is a function of T so unless there's an X there you have to have something after that just like we had a DX of Y we had to have that dydx right it was in terms of X so this says I need a DX DT show hands how people have that good you understand the implicit form of this that's what that means so let's go ahead let's figure out what happens at T equals 1 oh crap where do I plug in the t is there a t to plug in by the way you can't plug in can't plug that in D1 I shk your battles ship that's what that means no there's you get it that was funny no there's no there's no T to plug in so if I give this problem to you I have to give you more things I have to give you stuff I would have had to give you all this stuff right it has to be given somewhere in the problem so here's what I'm going to say find this out if if x = 2 and dxdt equal 4 at T = 1 at T = 1 no something please X and DX DT will change for certain times so at tal 2 this would no longer be the case but look what I've given you I said find it at tal 1 oh what's happening at tals 1 I've also given you that information does that make sense to you so I've G it matches up I've given you the piece for that so why does it say tal 1 and tal 1 it says find this at tals 1 yes but then I have to tell you what happens at tals 1 I can't just give these to you unless I Define tal 1 either because those things will change for other times now do you have enough information to plug this in you got an X got an X you got a dxdt ah I had the rate of change of X according to time that means you can plug in the numbers and figure this out so this would be what is it 48 units according to whatever time like seconds or hours according to whatever T is what does this mean this means that Y is changing at a rate of 48 whatevers per unit of time that's what that says you okay with this cool all right let's intensify the problem just a little bit so next thing we're going to talk about if you guys ever heard of the xon vales what did it do oil SP yeah and oil is crazy right because it usually sticks on the surface of water and just starts expanding just keeps on expanding now we're going to do kind of a simplified problem you see in the ocean there's there's current and there's drift and there's waves and stuff we're going to do a simplified xon Valdes what we're going to say is that this this small it's a small tank here it's not going to be we're simplifying the problem here uh it's started leaking oil and what it's going to do is give us a radius that's spreading at a certain rate uh we want to find out how fast the area is increasing at a certain radius so we want to be able to calculate model uh what the the surface area of this this oil SP is actually going to be do you understand the question here so let me write this out for you real quick oh by the way any questions on this one too late oil spill here's what we know radius is spreading at a constant 3 feet per second this is one of two cases because naturally if you think about an oil spill the radius should actually slow down right I mean because that area is getting massive after a certain amount of time so the r should actually slow down spreading so one of two things is happening either this is for a very small oil spill right at the beginning or for a certain segment of time which that could be the case or an instant of time or the oil is pumping out more and more and more and more okay okay so you start with a little spill and then you get more but in in any case we're saying the radius of this circle of oil is a constantly the radius is growing constantly okay so a constant 3 ft per second do you see why that would probably not be realistic unless you have a massive amount of oil that starts real small and then really grows do you see that CU I mean 3T a second like here's your your first Circle and then after 1 second uh it is now 3 ft more so can't even do that okay big and after another second so probably over a certain segment of time what we want to know is how fast is the area increasing when the radius is 30 ft how fast is Rus increasing when I'm sorry how fast is the area increasing when the Rus is 30 here's what you do first number one you assign some letters to take care of these things so firstly we need this according to time so we're going to put t for time what other things do we need to know about about this are what area so let's pick a for area okay what else do we need know about this well that's our ultimate question right but I mean just the variables that we're dealing with radius we have a radius so R for radius so the first part really shouldn't be that big of a deal just pick out some some letters so T is going to be your time in our case we only have two of the things that are happening we have a radius and we have an area that's it are you guys okay with our letters next thing you got to do after you assign your letters identify the formula that you're doing so this is step one step one is pick your letters step two is you got to identify what formula you're dealing with and it should be given up there somewhere it should have some relationship that relates all of your letters or everything except for T it should have that so what are we talking about here that's going to relate our area and our radius that's what we really want to do because the t is going to take care of itself when we find a derivative we want to relate an area and a radius can you find think of a formula that relates that yeah it's a circle right it's a circle so in this case our formula is not very hard just says can you relate everything up here and that's the idea of a related rates it says relate these these items I want to compare and so for us sure I have an area and a radius let's relate the area of a circle and the radius well that just says area equals PK r s that's what we're talking about you okay with this so far now D DT is going to come about this but that's what we're asking uh how fast is the area increasing that's going to be this Dad what else are we going to get up here do you see the drdt coming about so every variable you're going to get that d a DT is the rate of change of area according to Time Of course and we're also going to get a drdt now your problem is not going to give you specifically what drdt is and I can say drdt is this but it would be worded in such a way that you should be able to understand it what does Dr DT mean change radi good good it means a change in radius a d whatever that's the change in the change in radius by the way um do you know what Dr DT is going to equal for our specific problem right here it should say in the word problem this says the rate of change of the radius what's the rate of change the rate of change of our radius is it 30 that is the radius what is the rate of change of the radius said it should be how the radius is changing up says the radius is spreading oh it's changing at a constant of 3T a second so our radius here is changing at a rate of 3et per second do you understand how to get the Dr DT and and and identify that that's three in this case so it says the radius is changing hey that's a rate of change that's what we're talking about now after this we're almost done the only thing that we've got to do now step number three take a derivative with respect to time implicitly because they're all functions of time and then lastly plug in the values and you'll have it so here's what we're going to do we'll do it very quickly we're going to take DDT of a we're going to take DDT function of time of p r s there's no tricky rules involved here this is going to be da DT on the right hand side we have 2i R Dr R DT do you see where we're getting the 2 pi r explain to me why I don't have a product rule between my pi and my R why not Pi is actually not a variable yeah it's constant so this says bring down the two great subtract one from the exponent got it but I needed drdt do you see why I need a drdt I've got to be able to incorporate this information somewhere do I need to plug anything for Dad no that's my question that's why I have it over here so you're going to have everything plugged in except for the main thing you're looking for in our case we want just Dad you have to have all the other information plugged in are you with me still so far do I have everything else do I have an R what does it say my R is at this certain time so when when this time comes about my radius is 30 I don't even care what the time is do I don't even care my radius is 30 do I have a drdt three so we're going to have 2 piun * 30 * 3 ft per second in fact I'll use the unit so you see it 30t right 30 ft times 3T per second why am i showing you this well we should end in an area right can I say the area is increasing at 15t per second no because that would be linear area should be in square feet right are we going to get square feet absolutely so we're going to get oh what is that 180 what we've just found out is that for this specific oil spill our area is increasing when our radius is 30 ft our area is increasing at 180 unless I did that wrong well I forgot my Pi that's important yeah that's that's a factor of 3.141592 is that an okay answer the decimal this is great yeah now if if it ask it could give you something more realistic in the back your book but this is exact a high would give you approximation says that multiply 180 * pi that's how much a square footage is increasing per second at this exact moment in time and that's what we're talking about do you guys understand the idea of related rates we're going to try maybe one or two next time not a whole lot because this is basically idea it's an implicit derivative just with respect to time the problem's going to give you everything else all right our last related rates problem here's the idea behind this problem and behind every related rates problem basically we're trying to relate a formula that has all of our piece of information together and we're trying to relate it to time so we're taking derivatives with respect to time in order to figure out rates of change and that's our our whole idea rates of change with respect to time so in our problem here here's what's going on you're launching a rocket from the ground and you're going to televise it so what you want is this automated camera and you're going to set it up at ground level and you want to make some computer program that's going to watch it it's a very sturdy camera have you ever seen the people watching rockets and all zoomed in it's like looks like crap right you don't want to be that guy so you're like well you know we're math ORS so you want to set up this automated thing that's going to go and and the angle is going to be perfect to keep that rocket centered in its graphic the whole entire time you get the idea that's the plan so what we want to do is if this rocket is climbing at 600 ft per second when the Rocket's at 4,000 ft how fast will the angle of elev have to change at 4,000 ft to keep up with the rocket well now here's the deal when we start out this distance is going to be fixed and let's say that we're 3,000 ft away from the rocket so our camera is not going to move and the rocket is going straight up did you get the idea now because we have this Rocket's height the Rocket's height is going to be changing are you with me on that so we can't just call this 4,000 right now we do have to call it h because that is a variable that's going to be changed throughout our problem so our Rocket's way up here I don't know how to draw a rocket uh rocket that looks like an I don't know rocket whatever close to Rocket Flying Arrow I'm really a math dork okay so we've got this this rocket fly it's going to be H feet high we're going to figure out when H is 4,000 what we're going to be doing on this but when we when we come with our our problem here I told you there a few things we need to do the first thing we've got to do assign some letters assign some letters to what we're we're working with so of course we like to have what what's one thing that we're we're going to be relating time is definitely one of them so t for time what's another letter that we might use height good height H we've already have that on there so H for height anything else that we need we have the time we've got the height there's one more relationship up there second what was itel not acceleration the what the angle of the television so we have to have something to do with the angle of this let's see if we've related everything in our problem here's where you read through your problem carefully okay if we've missed anything if we left anything out then we haven't assigned enough letters a Rocket's climbing at 600 ft per second when the rock is at 4,000 ft that's a height we have something for height how fast is the angle ofe angle of elevation that's our angle so we needed to have that how fast will the angle ofation have to change that fast that's a rate of change so we need something to do with time so we have our time up there we have our angle up there we have our height up there okay this is back to our height so we have all the letters that we're going to need right here are you with me on this now we don't necessarily have to have a t in the formula we're about to write because we're going to take a derivative with respect to T we don't need the T but everything else must be related that means I'm going to have to have a formula that relates the height and the angle does that make sense so if I call this my [Music] angle my angle of elevation if I call that my angle I need a formula that relates height and angle I I need to have that is it Pythagorean theorem because you know what a lot of people do they go oh right triangle Pythagorean theorem that covers everything does that cover everything no that relates this and this and that but it doesn't relate the angle which is our main question right so if you use Pythagorean theor sure you can come with a formula and sure you can work some of it out but it's not going to have the angle relationship that we are looking for are you with me on this so can you tell me what incorporates an angle with this inverse it doesn't have to be an inverse it doesn't have to be solved for Theta it just has to have Theta in it you just have to has have the height in it okay tan tan would do it tan is opposite over hypotenuse yes oppj no it's not opposite over adjacent yeah what is opposite over hypotenuse what's adjacent over hypotenuse I'm stret you got you yes tangent is opposite over adjacent so does our does our tangent of theta have to do with the material that we have on the board right now are you seeing where I'm getting that from So Tan theta equals okay what was it again what over what which is specifically in this case what does that relate everything we wanted to relate does it relate the the angle and the height basically is what you're asking are you okay on where that's coming from got to have an angle down there somewhere that's typically dealing with some trigonometry doesn't involve an angle you probably don't have to use trigonometry this one we certainly do now the next thing after we assigned our letters and we made our our formula was what what' we do okay so we took a derivative of time actually before that we identified any rates of change U that's what we did as well so let's identify any rates of change that we have can you read any rates of change right any rates of change second that's a rate of change sure what is changing at 600 ft per second is it the angle the height or the time what is it the height here's how you write that if your height is changing with respect to time at 600 feet per second what would the change in height compared to time B what is that dhtt yeah dhtt that works this is the change in height with respect to time and you know that 600t per second actually we get a little more fancy is it a constant 600 ft per second it doesn't say that so this is specifically at 4,000 ft so it's defined at 4,000 ft that it's climbing at 600 ft per second uh Rockets when you have a a source of of propellant they don't climb at the same rate typically those those rockets that take off from the ground increase speed and increase speed and increase speed and keep going and going till they reach their escape velocity and find that they're gone does that make sense so right here at this 4,000 ft Mark we're increasing at 600 ft per second that's our our change in height compared to time AG is 4, right the height at at when H is 4,000 exactly right when H is 4,000 let's go ahead and let's try to find this what we're looking for is okay well we want one more thing how fast will the angle of elevation change that means how can I write how fast will the angle of elevation change what is that D Theta DT that's the change in the angle compared to time does that make sense to you the change in the angle this is how fast will angle elevation have to change that's the change in the angle compared to the time at 4,000 ft this is what we're looking for right there I'm going to kind of recap just a little bit to hopefully one more time go through this with you so what we do usually you're going to have a picture something to do with a picture here we have a triangle because we're launching a rocket and we have this angle elevation where the camera's watching the rocket go up just hopefully nice and keep it centered in the in the camera space you with me on this so we identify everything that we need to do we have our height we have our angle we have our time that's fine come up with a formula that relates those things that's really on you guys the the formulas usually AR aren't horribly horribly bad but you got to find one that works for you in our case we know that tangent of theta is height over 3,000 3,000 was a constant H that's one of our variables we need to relate so that does it for us then we go ahead and we we identify what our rates of change are the height is going to be changing at 600 ft per second this is the change in height compared to time 600 ft per second what we're looking for is the change in angle right there the change in angle with respect to time both of them have to occur when the height is 4,000 ft because we want to maybe that's our our marker we want to make in our computer program that's an important place for us I don't know I don't do computer programming but maybe that would be important for this particular one what do you do now what do you do now we have our letters assigned we have all our rates are change rates of change done and we're looking for this thing we have our formula what do you do to this formula what are you going to do take yeah take the derivative let's go ahead let's take a derivative of this take a d of that with respect to what let's do it with respect to time so this is implicit differentiation with respect to time go ahead and do that real quick or at least get start on it um here maybe is a hint for you if you're struggling with the H over 3,000 you could write this as 13,000 H make things a little bit nicer really wouldn't matter all that much but you could do that you could you could do that as well that'd be fine um now before we get going I didn't get a whole lot of enthusiasm on this side of the board are there any questions over here are you okay that we had to identify H and Theta and T no yes you sure are you okay on seeing where the tan theta equals H over 3,000 comes from by the way the reason why we get this the reason reason why we do this ahead of time is because this is going to be part of our problem you're going to have a d variable over DT for every variable that you have so when we have H and we have Theta you're going to have a d Theta DT in fact that's what we're counting on that's what we're counting on because that's what we're solving for and but you're also going to have a dhdt so you need to be able to identify that and that's what we were looking for so that's why I have a dhdt right here that's why I know I'm looking for a d Theta DT you're going to have one of those for every variable that you have because it's all implicit it's they're all functions of T we're going to feel okay with what we're talking about so far all right good now hopefully you made it just past this just past this would be okay let's take the derivative of tangent Theta with respect to T keep it in mind this is a chain rule every time because it's with respect to T so the derivative of tangent is what squ what good beta and then is that it because you touched the th with a derivative you have to have D Theta DT so far so good all right uh now other side what is 13000 H when I take a derivative of that the constants there still dhdt good why dhdt because it's in respective time okay so H is a function in terms of time so you absolutely must have a DH DT hey by a show of hands how many people got that good if you didn't get that and that some of you didn't raise your hand if you didn't get that are you okay on getting see squ Theta D Theta DT see where that comes from you every time you take a a function of of theta with respect to time you got to have a d Theta D are you okay on the 1 over 3000 that H that's that has a EXT one of one bring down the one take one away from it that becomes that H to the zero that's one but you need a dhdt that's a must you okay with this so far all right well now we're we're pretty much almost done when you think about it which piece are we ultimately looking for this is this is not what we're looking for we're actually not even looking for the Theta cuz that's the angle we're looking for the change of the angle over time we're looking for this piece how fast is the angle change changing over time you follow me at when it's 4,000 ft this is a constant and that we have a relationship at 4,000 ft you with me so far okay so this one's going to be easy we already have that this one might take a little bit more work let's talk about secant squ thet for a second first thing I need you to understand is that secant Square Theta really means see not that mean see Theta squ keep in mind this is all occurring at 4,000 ft so let's go back over to our our picture here and kind of fill in this the blanks a little bit this is 3,000 this H at a specific time will be how much are we looking at 4,000 that's going to be 4,000 at the moment of time that we're looking at you follow me on this that's be 4,000 someone who knows something about Pythagorean triples tell me if this is 3,000 4,000 very good if it wasn't 3,000 or 4,000 you'd have to do Pythagorean theorem to figure out that Distance by the way the reason why we're figuring out that distance is because we have to Now find what secant Theta is is secant what is secant one cosine so if you found cosine here and just reciprocated you would get secant are you with me on this so let's go ahead let's talk about what coine is what's cosine of my angle Theta what's cosine oh come on don't leave me hanging what's cosine here good specifically what's coine 3,000 over 5,000 therefore secant is 5,000 over 3000 does that make sense to you one over cosine right so secant would be reciprocate fraction you're going to get instead of 3,000 over 5,000 secant Theta will be 5,000 over 3000 or 5 don't forget that you're squaring it are you okay with this so far folks do you see where the 5,000 or 3,000 is coming from do you see where the squares coming from now I'm missing something let's do the dhdt right now as well how much is the dhdt that we were talking about because when we're at 4, ft we're saying okay now we 4,000 give me the rate of change of height with respect to time and that's what this is saying what's the rate of change of height with respect to time what what do we Mark that out as let's make this a little bit prettier can we do that make it prettier what happens over here 5,000 over 3,000 I love that that's nice so I'm going to get 53 s over here we're going to get did you notice something here as well look at the board here real quick did you notice how I didn't really divide by secant squ I I just plugged the numbers in that's okay to do you can plug in the numbers whenever you want to you're just going to have one variable remaining right your D whatever DT you're just solving for that it doesn't matter when you do it you could have divided both sides by secant squ thet would have worked that just fine you're just going to get a complex fraction there I wanted to save ourselves some trouble and just do it on the left hand side are you still okay with this all right let's go ahead and square it what are you going to get Square Times D Theta DT which is what I'm looking for equal 1 let's get rid of 25 you do what say what MTI okay very good so if I multiply by 9 25ths on both sides I'm going to get one the 9 over 125 and keep in mind all this happened when the height was 4,000 that's how we came with our secant that's how we came up with this thing as well so it was dependent on that height are you following me on that the 600 ft per second only worked for a height of 4,000 the SEC Theta only works for a height of 4,000 that's the specific distance we were at specific height so that was when the height was 4,000 I know that's small up there kind of I don't want to write it too big to let it take problem right so you can see it 4,000 what now can you tell me what we just found rate of change slope sure but in this context it's a rate of change a derivative is a rate of change so this derivative says the rate of change of the angle with respect to time how fast the angle must change in that moment of time in this specific moment of time to keep up with the rocket are you following that so how fast the angle must grow in order to keep up with the rocket at that moment before that maybe quicker after that maybe slower but in that moment that's how fast it needs to be climbing in that instant of time we have you understand the idea okay now let's make this a little bit little bit more easy to understand do that division how much do you get don't all talk at once here 72 or something like that2 072 this right here what you just gave me is going to be in radians per second radians per second could you please translate that into degrees so because we typically if I say 0.72 radians per second you really can't grasp that can you you know it's hard for us because we don't really deal with radians all that much translate that into degrees for me that means you'll multiply by 180 and you'll divide by pi multiply by 180 divide by pi you get [Music] 421 three yeah that's what do 0.72 radians is 4 13° per second is that more understandable 4° so at this moment of time so the rocket takes off right climbing 1,000 2,000 3 gets to 4,000 ft that camera better be keeping up with it at a at a growing increasing rate of 4.13 De per second so it's got to climb 4° in that 1 second at that moment of time now it's not even going to pass a whole second but at that moment it's climbing at a rate of 4.13 De per second do you guys understand the idea is a math all that hard not really this is probably the hardest part right there and that's what's going to be hard for you is coming up with a formula figuring out how to relate these pieces together after that look what you're doing you're just taking implicit derivative you're just dering it making sure you have a d variable over DT for every variable you have the everything else we give it to you if not you can find it with your relationship and then plug the numbers in and it'll work itself out um any questions on what we've talked about so far do you understand what we've talked about so far I've been doing all the talking today so any questions before we continue s deal the next thing we get to talk about it's chapter three we're going to skip section 2.9 for right now we might come back to it it's called differentials and linear approximation uh at the end of our our class I hope it you 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 3.1:  Increasing/Decreasing and Concavity of Functions
half more than more than halfway done really chapter zero chapter one chapter two right three four and part of five so cool chapter three specifically 3.1 today we're going to talk about increasing decreasing and concavity we're going to try to get all those things accomplished in in the time that we have let me give you an example a graphic example of increasing and decreasing just so you understand kind of the idea of what's going on let's suppose that we have this function just like that and let's say I break this up and this is this is that what I'd like to find out is where this is increasing and where this is decreasing and more specifically what the slope is doing at those on those intervals and that's kind of important for us so the first question is is this can you give me increasing means going up decreasing means going down as we're going from left to right we read our graphs left to right so can you give me an interval on which this function let's assume it's a function on which this function is increased SE going up certainly from A to B do you see how from A to B we are we're rising from A to B the function is climbing from A to B for sure we're going to use open intervals because at B something special happens at B it's no longer increasing we'll talk about that later how about another interval do you have another interval where we're increasing c c to D works good because from here to here we're growing up growing up this function is getting so old so fast how about from D onward what's happening there is it increasing is it decreasing okay constant very good uh any function any areas intervals that are decreasing for sure B to C D onward is pretty boring d onward is just a constant the slope is zero it's going to stay zero forever what I do want to talk about are the slopes of the increasing and the decreasing intervals what's happening to that function on those intervals let's look at a to B what would you say would the slope be for this point and I don't I don't mean like oh this is about 3 over one or 5 over one I don't care about that what I really care about is whether it's positive or negative so is a slope here positive or negative how about how about here how about here hey how about at B that's why B's not included right so from a all the way to B would you say that we have a positive slope do you understand that when I have a positive slope that means that my function is actually climbing do you see that look look again from from C to D let's look at C at C at c0 but just past C is that positive still positive positive posi it's still positive all the way up until the point D you follow me on this when we say we're increasing what that means for us as far as a derivative and the relationship that we're building this class that means that your slope is positive so increasing will happen if your slope is positive there's no way you can draw a positive slope and not be going upwards are you with me on that if you draw a positive slope you're going upwards true even if it's just at that moment you're going upwards for that moment so increasing inter will have a positive slope that should imply something it should imply that a decreasing interval will have a negative slope let's look at our decreasing interval there's only one of them it's a slope negative for our entire decreasing interval let's check it out use your hand or your pencil if you want to here's our decreased interval here it's at zero right at B but as we go past that is that negative negative even when it get down to here it's it is still negative but then it's becoming still negative but less negative until we get down to that point at this point look what happens what's going to happen when we change from decreasing to increasing what happens to our slope as we change from decreasing to increasing our slope goes from negative to zer to positive does that make sense to you from increasing to decreasing we go from positive to negative and we're going to incorporate all this stuff in into our graphing of functions in just a little while so right here we need to know that a decreasing interval will have a slope which is negative definitely negative slope I'm going to write out what I just talked about so this is nothing else than what I've just described this implies a couple things it implies it implies that if R what wait what will slope again how do we find slope and calcul this what gives us a slope if our derivative is greater than zero if our derivative is greater than zero that means our slope is positive is our function increasing or decreasing if our if frime of X is greater than zero on an interval a then my function is increasing on that interval you can see it from our examples this is definitely increasing right our slope is positive at every single point from A to B positive every one of those slopes at every single point is going to be positive that's all this says this says in English here it is in English for you if the slope the slope right if the slope's positive you're increasing that's all it says you guys understand that idea if the slope's positive you're increasing if the slope is negative then f ofx is decreasing on the interval you still okay so far in English again what this says is if your slope remember first of a slope if your slope's negative you're decreasing that's all it says the last case is if frime of x if you're derivative equals zero so your slope is zero what that says is that well if your slope's zero you're constant at that point or on the interval so for instance right here at B our slope is zero right that means we have a we're not increasing we're not decreasing we're constant right there that means a horizontal line true constant means a slope being constant means horizontal line so if we have our frime x equal Z we're we're talking about a constant line right there uh that means for us a change typically typically that's a change from increasing to decreasing or from decreasing to increasing or that we're constant that's what we're talking about what's very cool is that we don't need a graph to do this with just a function if we know how to find the derivative you can give me the intervals of increasing and decreasing we're just going to be having the set equal to zero and do what's called the sign analysis I'll teach you how to do that as we go on the next sections the last thing we need to talk about in in increase decrease in concavity is well of course concavity concavity is the direction of the curvature of your line or the description of the curvature might be a better I'll say Direction but or basically it's how the slope is changing now you're going to hope I'm going to try to match this up for you right now you know this uh first derivative means the slope correct how the slope is changing that's a rate of change of the slope should be a what type of derivative second derivative first Der gives you slope second derivative gives you how the slope is changing a rate of change of the slope and so when we're talking about concavity you're going to find out just second concavity has to do with the second derivative first derivative gives you increasing and decreasing concavity gives you the way that you are curved the direction of curvature that's the second derivative so basically it's how how a curve is increasing and decreasing let me give you an example about why this might kind of be important for you would you agree that to get from this point to this point and be continuous that you are going to be increasing on this okay and let let's just pretend that we we're not going to go up and down let's go from here to here and not go back down again so we we'll definitely overall be increasing from from here to here right is there more than one way to get from here to here well and still be increasing sure you can probably think of it I mean I'm going to be kind of simplistic about this you could be straight right but that's not fun you could do that couldn't you but you could also do that those have different curvatures here's one type of curvature here's another type of curvature here's one that's increasing at an increasing rate do you see what I'm talking about it's starting to go up and it's going up faster and faster and faster here's one that's increasing at a decreasing rate it's going up but it's going up slower slower slower slower and finally gets there right increasing at increasing rate the slope look at the slope of this here's my slope right my slope is positive for every point do you understand but my slope is positive here but it's even higher and higher and higher and higher my slope is actually increasing do you see what I'm saying the slope is increasing here this is increasing but the slope is actually decreasing the slope is going downward what that does is gives us the curvature notice really positive but the end not so much positive what it does is gives us how are our curvish shaped that that's basically it so concavity is the curvature of our our graph and right now I really just need to get to be familiar with concavity what's concave up and what's concave down so we'll talk about that for a little bit and hopefully get on to how to find these out from just functions this function is increasing everywhere true or false definitely true it's always going up is it going up at the same rate No in fact you'll notice this this is going up at an increasing rate oh wait and then that something happens doesn't it and then we we're we're level it looks like we're even for a while and then we start increasing but at a decreasing rate until we get to the top see what I'm talking about this is our two different types of concavity we have one region of this is going to be called concave up if the curve is increasing at an increasing rate that's this way this is going to be concave up your slope is positive your slope is increasing actually all we need is really the slope is increasing the slope is increasing that's going to give you a concave up concave up concave up you okay with that yeah wasn't concave well what I'm saying is concave up doesn't have to be increasing or decreasing as far as the function is concerned but the slope must be increasing I know this is going to be kind of weird for you wub your head around but this is a completely concave up shape right here would it hold water yeah concave up will hold water also how do you feel when you're happy when you're up when you're feeling up like you smile you're feeling concave up happy concave up is going to hold water it's going to be upper facing now if you're confused this to Mr Leonard why did you say that the slope is increasing the slope is increasing here watch what's the SL here very negative what's the SL here a little less negative we're not talking about the function we're talking about the slope of the function for concavity what's the what's the slope here very negative less negative less negative less negative less negative zero positive more positive more positive the slope is actually increasing the entire way through do you see the difference it's difficult to think about because I haven't graphed the slope I've graphed the function but we're talking about the slope and how the slope is changing for concavity there's the distinction so this is definitely concave up that's concave up what it says is it opens upward it's how people describe it it opens upward or it would hold water that's probably the worst one here's what it actually means in mathem matics if you're concave up it means your slope is increasing the function is not necessarily increasing we see that this is actually decreasing but the slope is increasing do you see the distinction there between increasing and concavity the slope is increasing on that that interval that's what concave but means you okay with this so far okay what's concave down look like feeling down down concave down Fry face it's your umbrella water slides right off it opens downward would not hold water but really what it means is that your slope is decreasing your slope is whether your function is increasing or not doesn't matter for concavity concavity says how's the slope changing slope changing for concave down means it's decreasing slope is decreasing notice look at how's this curve go yes the curve itself does this watch on the board here real quick notice the distinction the curve itself is increasing and then decreasing yes but the slope does the same thing the whole time the slope is very positive less and less and less and less and less and less zero negative more more more negative more negative it's always decreasing through the whole entire curve you see what I'm talking about there's a change there's a difference between increasing and decreasing as far as a slope is concerned there's a difference between increasing and decreasing of a function and the slope how that changes on function now here can you tell me where my intervals are for increasing and where my intervals are for decreasing stop me uh when I for for my slope stop me when I change from concave up to concave down uh what do I start with from let's start this way what do I start with here concave up or down and oh you missed it let's try that again no I'm just kidding and yeah somewhere somewhere in here now exactly where I don't know CU I don't know the function itself but it's going to be somewhere right about I would say there right about there we change we change from holding water to being an umbrella from being concave up to concave down from the slope increasing increasing increasing slope dies off decreases decreases decreases do you see what I'm talking about there that changes from concave up to concave down this would be up concave up concave down this point where you change concavity is called an inflection point inflection point or point of inflection that's your inflection point well we can going to continue talking about increase and decreasing concavity and how that relates to our first and second derivatives what we found out last time is that the first derivative is going to give you increasing or decreasing because if the slope is positive you're increasing if the slope is negative you're decreasing we also found about found out about the way the curve is shaped so basically how we're increasing or how we're decreasing is also important and what that was called was concavity can you tell me which one of these is concave up the left or the right so this was the concave up and this was the concave down and here's what we determine the second derivative which is the way the slope is changing if the slope is increasing or the slope is decreasing will tell you whether we're increasing uh at an increasing rate or increasing decreasing rate or decreasing increasing rate or decreasing at an increasing rate so basically how we're shaped so here's what we say if the second derivative is positive what that means is the slope is increasing if the slope is increasing that means we're going to be concave up notice what the slope is doing the slope is increasing does that make sense so if our second derivative is positive the second derivative says the slope is increased remember the second derivative is the rate of change of our slope you with me on this the first derivative was the slope the second derivative is the rate of the change of the slope basically if your slope is increasing or decreasing so says the slope's increasing that's going to give us a concave up so this means concave up if our if our second derivative is negative that means our the rate of change of our slope how our slope is changing that means it's negative that means it is that the slope is actually decreasing the slope is decreasing slope is positive slope becomes zero SL is negative that gives a concave down shape I did explain all that last time right okay good what would happen if the second derivative equals zero well right now we have question mark about that but here's what we're going to fill this out as if the second derivative equals z that means the rate of change of the slope is constant that means we don't know what's going on right there but it could possibly be where it changes from concave up to concave down or concave down to concave up do you remember what that point was called this is a possible inflection point there's cases where it's not but it's possibly an inflection point or pip pip let me review just a couple things with you uh let's give a couple graphs here do you have any inflection points on this graph yes could you tell me where it's concave up and where it's concave down what am I starting off with concave up or concave down concave notice how concavity really doesn't have much to do well it does have to do with increasing and decreasing but you can be concave up even though you're decreasing and increasing do you see what I'm talking about here we start decreasing then we increase however we're concave up the whole time well the concavity has to do with the the slope the way the slope is changing if the slope is increasing that means we're concave up so we're concave up tell me where to stop being concave up right in here somewhere in there yeah for sure somewhere in there we're we stop being concave up and we start being concave down we start being able to hold water and and have something that doesn't hold water where do we stop being concaved down somewhere in here it looks like about right there to me and then we're concave up for the rest of our our curve those two points those are called our inflection points so right here this is how this would relate to this this information these are inflection points let's look at the concave up it says the second derivative should be positive the second derivative says the slope should be increasing is the slope increasing here not the function not the function the slope is the slope increasing here sure until it gets to that point guess what happens at that point it starts it stops increasing and it starts decreasing in other way in other words our slope hits a peak and starts falling back down that's what that says now our slope is decreasing decreasing decreasing decreasing decreas till it hits that point and then starts increasing again at those inflection points that's what's going to happen is where your second der equals zero how people have an okay understanding of our concavity and inflection points I'll get more specific on how you actually find those later okay would you be able to give me intervals of increasing decreasing concavity and any inflection points that occur would you be able to do that for me yeah can you tell me where we're increas let's write that out increasing decreasing concave up concave down and any inflection points where are we increasing give me an interval where we're increasing the function needs to be going up from left to right where are we increasing so all the way from the start of our graph which I mean this goes way down but it could start ultimately from negative Infinity it increases all the way up it's going up until we reach x equals what z x doesn't equal three get I'm not talking about talking about that I'm talking about where do the function stop increasing where does it stop stop going up on the X axxis where does it stop okay so when I say from negative Infinity here's what I don't mean some of you who are a little bit shoddy on your graphing negative Infinity doesn't mean I start down here that's not what negative Infinity on the x axis means xaxis is this way right says from negative Infinity I'm increasing all the way till I get to this point which is zero do you see what I'm talking about the function is going up I don't care where the function stops but on on the x axis right there it's increasing from negative Infinity to Z to zero are you okay with that so not not the height of the function where it's increasing on the x- axxis does it pick up again and start increasing where at x equals what two so from two to where Infinity from two to Infinity on the x- axis would be another interval of increasing are you okay with the negative Infinity to zero and then the two to Infinity now your have you are feel okay with that okay so we're not talking about this way we're talking about what the function is doing as we're going along the x-axis give me decreasing how many intervals do we have that are decreasing one from where to where Z to two yeah if if we're not understanding this what some people say is from 3 tog3 is that our period of of decreasing no no that would be the range that we're decreasing from here to here but what I'm talking about is the function is decreasing on the X inter interval from 0 to two do you see what I'm talking about there yeah or no are there questions about that you guys dead today see a lot of that seems kind of intuitive not to say negative 1 to zero increasing or at that point where it crosses the X xais first time on the left right here yeah but we're still increasing from here as well so it slowly will eventually go we always read from left to right so we're saying when we start this function at negative Infinity cuz it never ends when we start this function it's automatically starting to go up and it keeps going up and keeps look at as I'm going like timeline right keeps going up keeps going up keeps going up keeps going up going up going up going up going stops going down going down going down going down going down going down stops going up going up going up going up going up going up forever forever do you see what I'm talking about have I have I droll you into a state where you're almost sleeping now yes good I'm glad glad that's you sleep hey me too all you have to do is sit there think about me come on selfish people 0 to2 is decreasing if you need more help on that you come and see me uh how about concave up you need to be able to determine concave up to concave down am I concave up here no concave up con how about here concave this is concave up this is right here where did it start right there ah concave up concave up forever concave up from one to Infinity concave down let's start that remember it has to go in order of a number line where do we start being concave down remember you're talking about the x axis the x-axis where do you start being concave down up till what point one the this is all concave down until you get to here right xais says to 1 is there an inflection point if you change concavity you have an inflection point uh what is it that one Z does it change concavity here does it change concavity here no x equals 1 or the 1 Z I know the notation kind of sucks because we don't have different notation for intervals versus points that's an interval that says from 0 to two non-inclusive from 1 to infinity non-inclusive infinity to one non-inclusive that's a point 1 to zero okay that's actual specific point I know our notation is horrible because points intervals look the same for some numbers but that this is a point those were all intervals we you feel okay with our intervals of increasing decreasing ify stick with it we we'll talk about one more you'll get practice on it on your homework as well absolutely um how about this let's see if if you kind of really understand what you're what you're doing here by the way were there any questions on that before um I move on I saw some people who weren't really quite grasping the whole why we have why we have these numbers but you have to think that this is all on the x-axis you're not talking about the heights of the actual function you're talking about where it's increasing decreasing so you're not you're never going to have a three you're not going to have a three you're talking it's going increasing until x equals z then it stops increasing it's decreasing from 0 to two that starts increasing again from two to infinity and that's what we're talking about and that's how you determine those intervals does that make a little bit more sense hopefully uh now at each point here's what I want to do I want to determine whether our first derivative or and second derivative are positive or negative that's what I want to do here so let's take a look at it let's look at Point a I'll help you out with point a and then the rest of them I want you to do on your own just practice it on point a I want you to look at our first derivative the first Der means slope the first derivative says whether I'm increasing or decreasing remember that first derivative says increasing or decreasing if the first derivative is positive I'm increasing going up the first Dera is negative I'm decreasing going down so let's look it very carefully very slowly let's think about the first derivative at a is my function climbing or falling at the point a is that increasing or decreasing decreasing so should this be positive or negative the first derivative will be negative there definitely negative it says that my slope is negative my slope's less than zero that means I'm decreasing do you follow me now let's think about the second derivative at the point a the second derivative says whether my slope is changing positively or negatively is if my slope is increasing or my slope is decreasing so think about this is my slope getting gradually bigger or getting gradually smaller so then my slope is increasing do you follow me my slope is increasing also that means I should be concave up my concave up right there for concave up is that positive or negative the second derivative will be positive it says my slope is increasing my second derivative should be positive do the rest do B and C for all right so let's go for it at point B if I'm looking at point B my function's increasing my slope is positive so this should be positive at point B oh that's almost at the cut off but it's still the slope is still little bit increasing right there so at point B we're still increasing this should also be positive did you get both of those positive yeah it's increasing and it's concave up that's how you can view that as well Point C at Point C my function is decreasing my slope is negative that means my slope is negative that's certainly true and also my slope is getting gradually less and less and less so my slope is decreasing as well if my slope is decreasing that's also negative concave down as well how people got both those right good for you if not notice where your mistake was was the first derivative or second derivative first derivative is increasing decreasing second derivative is concavity decreasing concave up decreasing concave up increasing concave up increasing concave up decreasing concave down decreasing concave down that's the same exact uh language or same exact idea that we just talked about now the next thing we're going to we're going to start getting into is relative extrema and how that relates to graphing pols so let's look a little bit about what relative extrema mean it's not it's not here's what a relative extrem here's what relative extrema means it means a relative Max or relative men you heard that before just to refresh your memory a relative Max is basically the idea of a high point on an interval it doesn't have to be the highest point on the graph just has to be the high point on a little interval so not the peak but it is a peak it is a peak it's a peak for an interval not the absolute not the absolute Max necessarily but it is for an interval the high point here's a better definition a relative Max happens when a function changes from increasing to decreasing that should make sense to us right from increasing to look at from increasing to decreasing we should have a peak that's a relative Max it doesn't have to be the highest point on the graph but that's the definition for relative Max so the high point that's kind of old old definition is not very mathematical this is where a function changes from increasing to decreasing you know what relative Min has basically the opposite definition right there a relative Min is going to be a low point in an interval other in other words it's going to be where you change from decreasing to increasing that should make sense right if you go from decreasing increas you're going to have a little Valley a low point so dot dot dot where the function changes from decreasing to increasing very quick examples for you just so you have a little look at this would you be able to find me my relative extreme of here relative extreme it happens where you are changing from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing so stop me when I get to relative extrema okay here no no because we're not changing from increasing decreasing okay you have that's part of our definition so we're going to start here no where do I get one what is this relative Rel Max very good relative Max is it the absolute Max is it the highest my function goes that would be right that would be how about let's keep going what else here that's a relative men relative men uh keep going this one yep that's another relative Max and then there that's another relative Min and then how about this one yeah even though it's an absolute Max which we'll talk about later it still be a relative Max no problem we have three relative Maxes we have two relative men in this problem do you understand the idea of a relative Max relative men changing from increasing to decreasing for Maxes that gives us a peak decreasing and increasing for men relative men that gives us a value my question is this if this is a change from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing that has to do with the slope doesn't it if the slope is positive we're increasing right the slope is negative we're decreasing true well what happens at a change from increasing to decreasing what does a slope automatically have to do if we're going from increasing to decreasing at some point between a plus slope and a minus slope you have to hit what number you have to hit a zero so what's happening to the slope as I'm getting to a relative Max as I'm getting to relative min max Min ma what's happening to the slope at those points positive increasing zero negative decreasing zero increasing zero decreasing zero so everywhere where we get a slope of zero we're going to have a possible relative Max relative men what we call those are critical numbers so what's happening to the slope at a relative Max REM in the slope is zero so at all these points note the slope is zero for the relative natural the point at which a curve has a horizontal tangent or in other words a slope is zero is called a critical number or critical point that's a little definition for it's called the critical number okay okay well let's think about this for a second all right if your critical number is a place where your slope equals zero do you understand the definition firstly of the critical number critical number is a place where your slope equals zero are they always relative Maxes remains no they're not you can have other things that happen so for instance this curve do you have a point where the slope is zero yeah but this is not changing from increasing to decreasing it goes from increasing to nothing to increasing again just a different concavity do you see it so that could give you a relative maximum it doesn't have to that's the idea of a critical number it's just a place where your slope is zero so if we're trying to find out where all of our slopes are zero for a function can you explain to me maybe the process of doing that let's pretend I give you a function I say I want you to find the critical numbers what might you have to do to find the critical numbers thetive set equal to Z so the derivative gives you slope true if I take the derivative and I set it equal to zero I'm going to find out all the places where my all the critical numbers where my slope equals zero did you follow me on that that's going to give me all my potential relative Maxis and in that's the idea so to find your critical numbers we're going to take the first derivative and set it equal to zero take first derivative set it equal to zero you okay with that as well one more side note um if you get a fraction typically all you have to do is solve for Zer to set the numerator equal to zero right for this process what we're going to learn is that for both the first second derivative I'm going to give you a first and second derivative test in a little while like probably a week uh but when you get there you also have to check the points where the denominator equals zero as well so if you get a denominator you must set that equal to zero as well that gives you undefined points for your slope you need those right you need any undefined points for your slope it's important so little note if you have a denominator set the denominator equal to zero as [Applause] well that could give you any undefined points for your slope which would be a big deal you can change from increase and decrease undefined points let me prove that to you increaseing truth decreasing yes slope is undefined you're going to change from increasing decreasing at that point even though it's not differentiable that gives you a point of change of increasing decreasing do you see what I'm talking about so denominator in the first in the first dtive you said it equal yes okay the denominator of the original function will just tell you where you're undefined a lot of times that will match up okay where you're undefined the function is where you will be undefined for your slope most of the time that happens but occasionally you get some weird stuff that happens so you need to do both can we do an example to finally get away from all this Theory stuff and really get into an example can we do that please are you guys ready for it yeah all right let's go ahead let's find the critical numbers this find the critical numbers of that thing what are we going to have to do to find the critical numbers well critical numbers involve slope right it asks where's a slope equals zero so find the slope function right now that means take a derivative go ahead take a derivative derivative should be pretty easy what's the derivative of this thing man I'm a nice guy don't you see I'm a nice guy I'm a nice guy that's nice that's nice why why is that nice what are you going to have to do that just gives you the slope right because you just found the derivative derivative means slope our critical numbers occur where our slope equals what set equal to zero solve it that's going to give you the X values where your slope equals zero can you solve that yeah that's like piece of cake to solve what are you going to do that's woman ask guy you have options really square root with a plus and minus that's going to give you plus and minus one factor out three different squares plus and minus one either way you can do that two ways okay so in either case here x = 1 x = 1 are those my points for my relative Max and relative Min those are my X values of my potential points for relative Max relative men are the in this case yes this is going to be a relative Max and a relative men uh this one should go Max men okay that's what that should be now we're going to talk all about that later right now I'm just asking to find critical numbers I'll show you how to determine that at a later time are you all right with that are these always giving you relative Max and relative Min the answer is no no they're not I've given you one example of that already this right here is going to show up as a critical number is it automatically a relative Max or relative Min no no there's some cases where it's not okay so you really do have to check on those I'll show you how to check on them later but they're not automatically relative Max or relative men we're going to switch gears just a little bit we're going to move from relative maximum in to Absolute Maxim in now what's absolute mean yeah absolute value would be like posit always positive but absolute means it's the most high or the most low relative you're noticing this we can have lots of relative Maxes right think about a sign curve oh my gosh there's relative Maxes all over that thing those all happen to be the absolute Max for a sign curve but they're all relative Maxes as well for the absolute Max it says what's the highest number you attain if any relative absolute Max and absolute Min means what's the highest or lowest value attained throughout the whole so we'll talk about that uh we'll talk about how to determine it it's not bad so don't don't let it scare you so when we talk about the absolute Max what we mean is the highest point on an interval overall the highest point that happens on that interval well then that would mean the absolute men means the lowest point on an interval as well not one of the low points the lowest that's what absolute how that differentiates from the relative relative could be well there's a few low points absolute minimum means the lowest absolute Max mean the highest is that on an interval or on the function on an interval now the interval could be from negative Infinity to Infinity uh but a lot of graphs don't have an absolute Max on NE into Infinity um in fact lots of polinomial don't so we talk about on intervals as well so some graphs don't have absolute Max or min on this interval for instance just think of a an X Cub okay what's the highest point that attains so it can you say the number does it reach a peak ever do you know how much Infinity is so I do [Music] how I don't no it's Infinity it never reaches an ending point does it it doesn't reach a highest point it keeps going and going and going and going does it ever have a low point the lowest point no this doesn't have an absolute Max or an absolute Min how about this one does that have an absolute Max Max no does it ever reach the highest point no it's Infinity does it have a absolute Min that's right there at 0 that does have one but you'll see some curves don't have the absolute Max in on infity Infinity some do most don't every polinomial doesn't have it has one of the other because polinomial go to Infinity somewhere or another right they they're never horizontally ASM totic so you're always going to get one so we we like to distinguish between everywhere and then certain intervals so an absolute Max is going to be the highest point on an interval that you say it is and the absolute me is going to be the lowest point on an interval that is defined for you or that that you say it is do you follow that that logic there okay okay so even though some graphs don't have an absolute Max or absolute Min on this let me make a little suggestion to you I'm going to suggest that every curve in the world has an absolute Max and an absolute Min on a closed interval would you agree with that on a closed interval so if I say from 3 to two there's going to be a highest point there's going to be a lowest point as long as the function is continuous yes we don't want this idea that would not but as long as it's continuous that's going to happen so this not so much but every function has absolute Max and men if the function continuous on any closed curve I swear you practi is hard front of your mirr on any closed interval open interval not necessarily we'll talk about that in a bit but closed interval absolutely yes okay here's let me let me talk about one little piece of information you kind of need to know uh every continuous function what that means is the function doesn't have to be continuous for the entire space of human existence what it has to or X existence I guess whatever but it has to be continuous on that that closed interval does that make sense to you it's got to be continuous here if it's continuous there it will certainly have an absolute Max a highest point and absolute man a lowest point do you follow me on that if it's continuous for this part it'll be there now where might it exist where might that happen well there's only a set number of points if you think about it if you think about it that's a closed curve true closed curve with my closed interval where could the absolute Maxes and mins possibly occur well they're either going to occur at a relative point where I'm switching from decreasing to increasing or increasing and decreasing it's going to happen either there or it's going to happen at the end point there's only two cases it's either switching from going up to going down that gives us a low point or high point or it's at the end where I would continue to go up but I just chop it off and I go no you stop there haha ha and then it has to occur there does that make sense to you so it's either got to be at an end point or at a relative uh Max or in that means a critical number so what's going to happen for your your absolute Max or in for any closed interval it must take place you should be W it must take place at either a critical number or an end point this will occur at either a critical number or the end point can you raise your hand if you understand that logic that it's going to be one of those two places either going to be where a function changes from going up to going down going down to going up or one of the stopping points of our interval do you follow me on that it's got to be one of those places which means there's only a a few points you need to check when you're find an absolute Max in you're going to be checking your critical numbers by plugging them into your function but you're also going to check your end points we'll do some examples in that in just a second and whatever's the highest one that's your absolute Max whatever's your lowest one that's your absolute Min that's it that's all we're going to have to do this implies one more thing though kind of like a corollary what if I don't have it closed what if I have this what have it open think about this for a second this is an interesting case okay check it out not check out my racing check out what I'm going to write after a race check it out I can race really good if this is closed and the points are included can you all see that the absolute minimum for this interval is right there that happens at actually a relative Min where we change from decreas to increasing the absolute maximum is not this point because there's a point higher it actually occurs at the end point you follow me but now watch what happens if I say aha that would be this case by the way where you're closed what happens if I say no no longer do you have those points now this and that where they're not included that's this case that's this case do you still have an absolute minimum yes that point is the same do you have an absolute maximum it's not here anymore is it do you have an absolute maximum think about the question does this ever stop getting closer let's say this level is three okay let's just pretend that's a three does it ever get to three no does it get to 2.9 does it 2.99 2999 299999 2999999999 can you keep doing that forever and ever and ever so do you ever reach an absolute Max no no no you don't because you can keep getting closer and closer to three between any two points you can find an infinite number of points right between 2999 however much you want to go and three there's an infinite number of of points that you could attain so there is no absolute maximum here what this says is that if you listen carefully if you've got a closed interval you are going to have an absolute Max and an absolute Min if it's closed understand if it's open that means the absolute Max and men must happen if they occur at a relative point at a critical number that's where they have to occur if they don't occur there then they don't exist at all Clos intervals you got both open intervals if they were to occur they would happen at your critical numbers if they don't then they don't exist if they occur if they occur they do so at critical numbers because there are no end points take away the end points here and they have to happen in critical numbers let me do one thing for you okay let's fill out let's say that this is no no longer just open let's say this one is closed does it change the fact that we have an absolute Min but we don't have an absolute Max let's say that I open this one back up and I close that one does that change the problem that now has an absolute Max and that's the idea you're GNA be dealing with those type of intervals on your homework where you're going to be finding your critical numbers no problem if they're closed intervals you check your end points if they're not closed intervals you check your end points but they don't have you check your end points you would still check this you'd say how high does that reach how high does that reach if it reaches close to three if I were to plug it in if it reaches close to three well then that is bigger than this point right that means there is no absolute Max that means that yeah I'd get really close to that number it's bigger than this one but I never get there therefore there is no absolute maximum um so for instance if I asked you this question find the absolute Max between the interval of -1 to 4 and I ask it to you this way if it's this way they're both closed in you follow me absolute Min is here absolute Max is there if I ask it to you this way absolute Min is here absolute Max is there if I ask it to you this way looks like that absolute Min is here absolute Max is up doesn't exist why not because you'd say well if it were to exist it would occur either here at a critical number or here at an end point however I don't have an end point so all you have to do is this this is what you would do you would take this number even though it's not an end point you'd plug it in you plug it into your function and you say is this value bigger than this value function wise because you're not going to have a graph you're going to do this all with your functions you plug it in if this number when you plug it in is bigger than this critical number that the height of that then you can't possibly have an absolute Max because this one's going higher than that that's what you're talking about if you do this nothing changes same same so if you were to go on with the function to the right and come back down and then put like the open interval would you like right here yeah you'd have an absolute Max okay well what we say we do a couple examples here we'll start remember that clock's a little fast so we time so to find your absolute Max and Min you find your critical points and you evaluate them critical [Music] numbers and you evaluate your end points let me give you an example um so that I can I can really flesh this thing out for you and that will end our day make everything nice and clear tell me the first thing you do we're going to do it very quickly what do you do do it that's your D did you get the same derivative oh good my derivative hats on taking right today what do you do with that derivative folks you're setting equal zero because you want to find the place where the slope is equal to zero right that's your critical numbers that's the only places where you could possibly go from up to down to down to up so set it equal to zero and factor and solve what are you going to factor out of that you're going to get x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 you're going to continue to factor you're going to get x - 3 you're going to get x - 2 = 0 you're going to get x = 3 and x = 2 I factored that very fast but I mean that should be kind of no stuff are you guys okay on getting the three and the two are you sure so here's what you check these things right here are called your critical numbers they are the only potential for going from increasing decreasing decreasing increasing your relative Max and men so what you check you check for sure your critical numbers x = 3 x = 2 xal and x what numbers are going to go here and here one and five very good one and five why where am I getting the one and the five sure so one five where do I evaluate those the original the derivative is just going to give you zeros here it's going to give you something worthless for those two we plug into original function because the original function gives you Heights do you understand the original function gives you Heights we want to find out what's the highest and what's the lowest would you take those numbers people on the uh right side my right side you people plug in the first two you people plug in last two make it quick cuz we're out of time as soon as you get them just yell them out to me for the one and the two and for the three and the five you guys have it easy they are I can't do my head I probably be the one if I really thought about it but I want to 37 no wait no way off 15 23 this gives you a height of 23 true this gives you what now 28 28 like it okay uh what else what's the three three and the five come on three and five five I think it's 55 the five is 55 maybe not 55 okay 55 what's the 27 for this one 27 27 27 perfect this is this is perfect numbers for us here is the explanation of absolute Max and absolute men you need to watch carefully this is going to put everything together in your heads right now okay what's the largest number that is attained 55 that is now your absolute Max your absolute Max is not five your absolute Max is 55 it occurs at xal 5 does that make sense to you the absolute Max is 55 it occurs at xal 5 that's the end point do you see the end how the end point comes into play for us so this goes up and then stops that was a picture I drawn earlier what's the minimum value that's obained did they occur critical points or points for this one and points sometimes it'll be critical points let me make one more thing very clear to you and then we'll stop for today what if I had given you this that listen you do exactly the same thing exactly only when you plug this number in and you get the 55 can you actually get to the 55 that you are gone with the max that's how that would disappear this only have an absolute Min in this case if I did this you you'd have nothing no absolute Max no absolute men how people understood today okay we'll do one more example this next time and then we'll continue okay so right now we're in the business of finding absolute Max and absolute men and what we discovered from last time is that well let's see what what you know about this is this going to have an absolute Max and Min for sure why would you say that if it's if it's continuous that's closed so the absolute Max in if this is continuous on the interval will either be between will be between that open interval or at an end point so those closed end points dictate if that's a continuous function that we will have an absolute Max and Min if I have them open do we necessarily have to have an absolute Max and Min no not necessarily it could go way higher than a relative Max relative men so and and never actually get to that point what's our idea of how to find an absolute Max or men what do we do first that's like if you don't know just say derivative and 90% of the time you're right because in calculus the answer's derivative in calculus 2 the answer is integral so if you're falling asleep you're like Mr Leonard says what's this you go derivative 90% of the time you going be right okay in math 4B it's integral yeah you're right that that's that's most of the class so yeah it's a derivative but why oh good very good okay so what we're doing here is realizing that absolute maximums have to occur at either a relative Max or relative Min or an end point to find relative Max or relative Min that's kind of hard to do right there uh to find that you find where the slope is zero changing from increase and decrease and that would give you those Peaks and valleys we evaluate all of the critical numbers and the end points and that will tell us the highest and lowest find me the first derivative please okay first derivative if you do this first derivative says you take down the 4/3 you're going to get 24 over 3 or you simply as you go either way you get eight x to the good minus perfect very good how many people were able to find that good for you all right now what do we do with that good because that is my slope I want to find out where I have a horizontal tangent that's the potential places where I could be switching from increasing decreasing or decreasing increasing potential places we'll check that so here we're going to go ahead set this equal to zero and solve for x how no not that one no factor factor yes Factor but which one the smaller one the smaller exponent is what you factor okay you wouldn't try to factor out x to the 5th out of that would you try fact fact the smaller one and a lot of times it's going to help you so if I factor out x^ the -23 remember that factoring means divide right factor means divide distribution means multiply so factor means divide we're taking our first term sorry divided by the term we are factoring out what happens when you have common bases being divided you are subtracting exponents so do this math in your head 1/3 minus 2/3 you're actually adding 2/3 there you're going to get x to the 1 power do you see what I'm talking about you're going to get x to the so this right here gives you 8 x reason is cuz you have 1/3 -2 2/3 that's 3 over three that's going to be 8X minus well this one's easy X to 2/3 we pull the whole thing out we get one is that a lot easier to solve yeah oh heck yeah yeah this is this you'd be stuck on that if you couldn't factor I mean you stuck but here we now know that we have two factors being multiplied together that gives us zero the zero product property says that either this one is zero or this one don't forget about that one by the way or this one is zero that means xal 0 or x = 1/8 what are those numbers called that we just found what are those critical points critical points or critical numbers I think your book might use critical numbers critical points or critical numbers that's what those say those are where you have potential of having a a horizontal slope or I'm sorry you do have horizontal slope potential of having uh relative Max or relative Min are you okay on finding that the basic algebra if you need help on that you come and see me I'll show you how to factor out negative exponents that should be in from your math C classes or your intermediate algebra classes um now what do we do after that PL into theun these two and what else end points so do that so here's here our X values we're plugging in we're doing- 1 because that's an end point we're going to do zero because that was a critical number we're going to do 1 18 because hey that was a critical number and we're going to do one because that's another end point whichever one of these values is biggest that's your absolute Max whatever one of these values is smallest that's your absolute Min and these the places where they occur I think I made that point last time go ahead and plug those in for me and find out what you get for oh how nice was was I that I gave you eight huh works out so nice cube roots oh you love me now don't you no in M the far okay you will let me get down here little bit see one would you get nine tell you what I'll I'll do this one for you guys just cuz I'm nice guy three 16 what's 16 * 6 9 so 90 I do that wrong 96 96 wait for the whole thing oh no no you you have to subtract six I believe someone tell me what that is you shouldn't be looking at me blankly right now you should have a calculator and you should be working on it don't look at me blankly come on if I can do that in your head you have all calculators you should be able to whip that out oh you know I did I did it wrong it's it's uh I was wrong with that I did with eight not one 616 okay so somehow we got to be able to get those things which is the largest number that we attain that is your absolute Max the absolute Max is not negative 1 okay that's just a place where on the x- axis where you get it so this is your absolute Max it occurs at xal 1 what's your minimum that's the one yeah absolute men n occurs at xal 18 so let's do a couple more questions here okay let's say that I did uh this do I still have an absolute Max yes yeah absolutely yeah that's that end point right I didn't get rid of that end point do I have an absolute Min yes min is that an end point then I still have it that's fine absolute Max no no that's off the table right now so the negative one's gone okay no absolute Max uh absolute Min yes yes that's still there okay so are you starting to see how the end points play a factor in in what you're doing here now let's try one more I want to find the absolute Max and Min on that that function my question is can I check this can I check it on that close interval 0 to one why or why not so if I plug in zero I would get a zero right on the gometer that's not a good thing if I plug in one I'll also get a zero on the geometer you see what I'm saying so on this interval I I I'm not going to have any end points because those are ASM tootes at that at that spot so I'm not going to have any so I can't check this can I check this no no I can only check the open interval so okay well how do we do that well when we doing something like this it's not like you can plug in one and zero right like the polinomial you could just plug the in and see if they're getting bigger or getting smaller you can't do that here so what we're going to have to do is find first the critical numbers that's what we do all the time you with me you find critical numbers you set it equals zero you set the derivative equals z that's fine but then we're going to have to take some one-sided limits we're going to have to find the limit of this thing as we're going towards Zero from the right and the limit of this thing as we're going to towards one to the left that's going to give us where our function is tending now stop for a second just think critically about this you know that there's going to be an ASM toote here and here right so this function is either going to be going way up high or way down low and then way up high or way down low so somewhere we're not going to have an absolute Max or Min or both we don't know we just need the limit to tell us where it's going it could be going like this right in that case we'll have an absolute Min but not an absolute Max could be going like this in that case we'll have The Backs but not men could be going like this or like this in which case we're going to have nothing you follow so we're going to do that now let's go ahead and let's do that before we do the derivative because if it's like this we're done that' be kind of nice right can we do the limits first so limit as X approaches zero X approaches one um zero are we going to be going from the left or from the right to get to Zero from the from the right 0 one you're to get to one you're coming from the yeah now let's do the limit is there anything anything to factor well yes yes there is you can Factor on X is there anything to simplify that X so what you need here is a sign analysis remember the sign analysis that we talked about so if you're talking about sign analysis from zero to one oh you know what we might need a derivative actually because it's going to give us a separating point there um you can plug in a number really close to zero and see what it's doing a really number really close to one but I do want you to check this out let's find the derivative and find our critical numbers and see how it plays A Part here as well it might oh it might not play a part no you know what I doubt it plug in a number between 0o and one would you agree that those are the only places where we actually have a problem so at zero one so anywhere between there between 0 and one our signs are all going to be the same true so we're going to be either all positive or all negative that's going to be interesting so we're probably going to be in one of these situations all up or all down we don't have a separating Point here to critical number won't give us one actually that's just for a slow misspoke earlier um like 5 seconds ago keep track of that the only time that happens kidding anyway uh since we don't have a break between there and that is our interval these are all going to be either negative numbers or all going to be positive numbers I'm guessing since once you when you square fractions they get smaller that this is probably all going to be negative is that true so I plugged in a number between here since these are ASM tootes and we got negative the whole way across true whether you plug in 0.1 or 9999 you're going to get all negative numbers that means our ASM tootes look like this I can guarantee you right now that we're not going to have what minimum we're not going to have an absolute men why not because it goes to NE Infinity for sure even if one side went to NE Infinity it still wouldn't have an absolute minimum you okay which one will we have why it comes it's going to come up and it's going to go back down that says on a continuous function which this one is in that interval that's continuous in that interval that says I will have an absolute Max there how do we find it that's where the first derivative comes in so right do you understand this this said coming from zero coming to Zero from the right gave you negative Infinity coming to one from the left gave you negative infinity negative Infinity is way smaller than any number you can find so that's there that means there's no absolute minimum that's going to the same place no absolute min minimum they don't have to go to the same place okay they go to positive Infinity but this just says that in both cases you're not going to have an absolute minimum do you follow if this one had magically gone to positive Infinity we'd have neither if they' both gone to positive Infinity we would't have an absolute Max but we would have a Min you with me on that the logic there so find these first that might be a great way to do it eliminate some of the your your problem or eliminate uh some of your choices we are not going to have an absolute men now I want you to find the first stative there's a couple options you can move that thing up top and make it negative one you can do a quotient rule for hopefully you're able to find about the same thing by the way some of you your your negatives are are nasty all right some of you are ruining some of your problems based on your negatives especially Distributing your negatives on your implicit differentiation so when you get that homework back I it's already graded I've looked at it but this is too much to pass around in one day there's a lot of it uh so when you look at that check out your I've circled your negatives so you're just not Distributing negatives be careful on that stuff like here if you don't have that parenthesis you put a negative up front without Distributing you're going to be wrong on that plus one do you see what I'm talking about you're be wrong there so here this is Ely -2x + 1 x^2 - x 2 so hands how many people able to find that derivative if you did the quotient rule you'll get the same thing you just have to distribute okay and you'll get -2X plus one did anyone do it that way po rule you got the same thing perfect what do we do with our first derivative in order so that we find our critical numbers what do you set it equal to so do that set it equal to zero now even though that looks really really nasty think about something just think where could this possibly be equal to zero it's not where the denominator equals z because that that's going to give you undefined points in fact that's just going to be zero and one again isn't it so the only place it could possibly be equal zero is where the numerator equals Zer so when you're solving rational equations like this is which you've done before you just have to set the numerator equal to zero and that in this case is very easy which by the way you remember when I had you do all the Distribution on quotient ruling like oh my gosh do we really have to do that can we just leave it in parentheses no because you have to solve it right so you're going to have to distribute it anyway so you may as well do that you're going to get 2 -2x + 1 = 0 subtract 1 divide 92 x is 12 show hands how people feel okay on getting X is2 this row are you guys okay on this all right hey x = 12 is that in our interval yes you should check that right you should probably check that uh so that's in our interval that means within our interval we are certainly as as I magically predicted we're going to have some sort of a critical number there because we were down here we're down here it's got to reach a Peak at some point at least one Peak how do you find that Peak plug it in do I need to check my end points no do I have any end points no we've already done that work first we know that our end point points we not have any it's going to keep going down forever so all you got to do with this since you know it's going down forever you know for certain that is going to be an absolute Max it's continuous this is negative Infinity that's negative Infinity it has to go up it has to come down since it is continuous so you just plug in 1/2 whatever value that is that's an absolute Max what'd you get anybody else get ne 1/4 yes you plug it into well not your derivative right that would just give you slope plug it into here so is the absolute Max 1/2 or is absolute Max 1/44 wait a second it's actually it's on the bottom thanks Scott because I I was just taking whatever I was pluging it into good it's all right reciprocated you're going to get4 forg the absolute is the absolute max4 or 1/2 it's -4 it occurs at X = one2 so at start x = 12 that's your absolute maximum for that function can you do it yes how many people feel okay with what we just talked about so our ideas are if you don't if you have one of these weird functions man and you can't plug in the end points you're going to if you can't plug those in if it's not a polinomial and you literally can't plug it in do your sign analysis you know they're going to be ASM tootes right we've talked about that you know they're going to be ASM toes they're either going to do this this or this right they're gonna do one of those things like dance moves anyway that's what's that's what it's going to be it's going to do this or this or this I'm so awesome on the dance board by the way so cool not really not at all I'll do my calculus dance um so you you know you're going to eliminate some of your choices here so there won't be minimums and maximums in some cases then you find your derivative then you know what you have after that okay if if you get a minus and a plus then you're done yeah you don't even have to do the you're done those are nice problems those won't happen very often but those are nice problems most time you're going to get this or that otherwise problem is kind of stupid right anyway do you have a good feeling about absolute maximum if you have end points you check end points and critical numbers if you don't have end points you check critical numbers and you do one side limits of side analysis and that's that's the basic goal

now I'm going to give you a rundown of rolls theorem in about a minute y we're not going to really be covering a whole bunch of section 3.2 uh it's a very cool it's cool it's a good idea but I can tell you the idea in about a minute so here it is rules the says if your function crosses the xais and then crosses the xaxis again so like that and it's continuous between those points so it could do anything but if it crosses here and it crosses here and you know it's continuous between them tell me something that absolutely has to be certain about your slope between these two points well it's going to have a maximum sure it will have a maximum but tell me something between this interval about the slope not the not ABS care absolute maximum we're over that past that tell me what the slope will be equal to at at least one point between here and here zero it must be because you're coming up and you're coming down right somewhere at least one point you will have a zero slope does that make sense that's what R's theorem says hey by the way I'm going to draw a corollary right now what's the slope of the x-axis and that's the line that these two points cross right I'm going to show you the the mean value theorem the mean value theorem says take two points and draw a secant AB would you agree that that secant line is going to have a slope okay tell me something something between these two points if this is continuous actually let me make it stronger if it's differentiable actually has to be differentiable because otherwise that eliminate sharp points okay so it's got to be differentiable if that's differentiable that's true if this is differentiable what has to happen at some point along this curve with a slope Zer has to be not zero parallel what was it has to be parallel good parall what do you know about parallel lines okay so would you agree that somewhere from here to here this will have the same slope as this now make the jump do you see that this is exactly the same thing as this that's a special case what's the slope of this line somewhere along there it's going to have a zero slope you get it what's the slope of this line I don't care but somewhere along here it's going to have a slope of that exact secant value that's the rules theorem and the mean value the so it's just a concept uh well you can verify it but yes it's just a concept if f ofx is differentiable more than continuity differentiable on AB frime of X will equal zero for some point on a that must be true and that's a fancy way of saying what I just said uh you know what this takes a little bit more work to write it simply but would you understand that the slope of this would be b f of B well the point is b f of B and the point is a f of a then the slope is Y2 - y1 over X2 - X1 are you okay with that that that is actually the slope Y2 - y1 or X2 - X1 then if f ofx is differentiable on AB the first Dera will equal that slope at some point okay that's rolles theorem and mean value theorem if you're required to check these which I think some of your homework says that uh what you would do is this this this is it for mean value theorem you find the first derivative you set it equal to zero you're going to get an x value right all you need to do is verify that the x is between A and B it will be if it's continuous it will be for this one this is a little bit more tricky you have to find the slope between the two points you get me find the slope this is the slope between two points take your first dtive watch carefully take your first R and set it equal to the slope you get me set it equal to the slope and solve for x it's not zero it's slope and then verify that whatever point you get is between your and that's all that says it's a ver verification process basically so all in all in plain English this says if F ofx crosses the x-axis and it's it's differentiable at some point you will have a horizontal tangent all says if f ofx is continuous at some point the slope of your function will equal the slope of your secant between two points if it's if it's differentiable between those two points that that's all it says or fueld okay with your roles in me value sweet love that now 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 3.3:  The First Derivative Test for Increasing and Decreasing
stuff that we actually can do that is interesting it really is but stuff that we can actually do some things with specifically we're going to get into some curve sketching which I know it doesn't sound really cool because you can kind of do it on a calculator but this will lead you to understand why curves are the way they are and why they're shaped the way they're shaped a calculator won't let you do that so we're going to start section 3.3 tell you something about the first derivative test some of you are alligned because you just realize we finished two sections right yeah and there third section and it's going to go very fast you don't have to throw your calculator down in Anger all right you have to do that recall something for me if we just did this like well on the video it seems like only 20 minutes ago but actually was on Wednesday um what does this mean first okay it's first derivative and it's positive greater and zero means you're both right what's it mean no oh no I burned your pment for that back to staple has nothing to do with concavity nothing to do with concavity at all first derivative has to do with the slope or that's the rate of change of your line so it would tell you increasing or decreasing that's what it would tell you so those of you said increase and decreasing you're right concavity no that's second derivative okay second derivative tells you how the slope is changing so you need a second derivative to do that uh no that says the slope is positive if slope is positive you're like this right what's your line doing going up or down increasing this says increasing understand refresh your remember on 3.1 if this is just like oh my the first part 3.1 what's that mean definitely decreasing slope is negative First negative slope is negative decreasing aha what's this mean Conant constant that would be a horizontal tangent that would be finding critical numbers constant or critical numbers or critical points if you prefer I think they switch to critical numbers because technically x equals a value isn't quite a point is it it's just a number now I'm going to tell you how to find relative extreme you think you already know because you know what critical numbers are but I'm going to give you a nice graphic it's you have all the information okay I'm not going to teach you anything really new you have it all up here you have on your on your notes what I'm going to tell you is how to do it properly I'm going to give you a graphic organizer so that's a little bit easier for you would you like that here and do this on your homework this is how I want should do it how to find a wh whoops that can't that cannot girlfriend watching this kidding she hates math so I'm in luck it's horrible how to find relative extrema here is what you're going to do you are going to do something called the first derivative test that's what this is is to do so first derivative test says first derivative test number one take the first derivative we're so original in mathematics take the first derivative that has to do with first derivative test number two set it equal to zero for your critical numbers number three you're going to make what I like to call the first derivative table here's what the first D derivative table looks like you draw a number line This is a number line it's just an it's a way to organize your graph okay cuz ultimately just to give you like an advanced organizer we're going to be graphing functions so this is the first part in graphing your functions it's just organizing it for you so this is going to be a graph what goes on the top of your your little graph here is your first derivative represented by your critical numbers so you put your critical number number one critical number number two and so on until you run out of critical numbers they have to be in order so critical number critical number critical number however many you get there might be zero there might be one there might be a dozen of them doubtfully a dozen so take the first three no problem set equal Z we've done that already we found critical points that was 3.1 make that table that's something new but it's not very hard to do then what we're going to do for our table step number four I'm just redrawing here listen you know that at this point and this point and however many I have your first derivative will be zero right and that's telling you you have a horizontal Tang so before that note that you're going to either be increasing or decreasing right after that you're going to be either increasing or decreasing after that you're going to be either you are either going to be increasing or decreasing here and increasing or decreasing here and increasing or decreasing here if you weren't then it would have shown up you follow me it would have been there it would have been a critical number would have been saying oh my slope's zero so if those are your only numbers you must be either increasing or decreasing so step number four we test a point in each of those intervals it's so much like a sign analysis test only you do it in the first derivative and that's going to tell you because a first gives you increasing or decreasing if you're positive here are you increasing or decreasing inre increas inre inreasing if you're negative here what are you increasing yeah so and if it changes you know you have a Max or a Min if it doesn't change you know you don't have a Max or a minim does that make sense to you that's our whole idea so for each interval you're going to plug in a number into fime of X I'll say it this way find the sign of each interval each interval by plugging a value into frime of X not F ofx that'll give you points we want slopes slopes why because this will tell you increasing or decreas and that's what we're looking for some of your zoning out you got to be with me on this stuff because this tells you increas and decreasing okay uh I let two examples because this pretty much self-explanatory I mean you've done all this stuff you've taken first Ros right now that was what this whole class was until this point you know how to set the equal to zero that's algebra you know how to plug numbers in that's algebra so that's it I'll show you a couple of them but really the idea is the same for all of it just be aware that what I told you about rational functions still stays the same to find critical numbers for your first derivative uh you the zero when you said equal zero just look at the numerator now what we are going to discover is that you also have to use those denominator numbers for for your tables we'll get there later on show you why that is the way it is uh but you know maybe I'll show you now I think I might have one of those examples uh but you also have to use those for your your first derivative and second derivative test because things can happen there for instance um if you have an ASM toote sometimes functions look like this right see how that changes from increasing to decreasing but that number is not going to show might not show up on a first derivative test so you'd have to put any places where you're undefined from your original function on that because you could change from increasing to decreasing there so we'll also be doing that so look for critical numbers uh maybe I'll make a little side note here also put any undefined values so basically ASM tootes put any Asm tootes okay we're going to do the first derivative test here so first thing uh what are we going to do for our first derivative test why don't you tell me do it I got to warn you I will warn you some of the ones in the homework there worst derivatives of course I don't have the time to do expansive just derivatives already done that in this class that was for the first chapters all right but the ideas are the same okay U if you need more help on those D you come and see me check out the previous videos can make sure you know how to take those uh what are we going to get for our derivative and what do you do with that and what do you do with that factor 3 Factor xus 1 add theide 3 take a root plus and minus I think we've seen this like three times in this class actually x = 1 and 1 you okay with the one and the negative 1 hey quick question are there any other points that would make this undefined any denominators that's what we're really looking for any denominators okay that would give us ASM tootes so if there's no denominators then those are the only two points I'm going to have in my first derivative test here's how you make it out you're going to put fime of X you're going to make this line slightly below frime of X it doesn't go right after go slightly below it and the reason is I'm going to give you another piece for down here so we're going to fill out the second piece in the next section on the top this works for your frime of X you're going to put your critical numbers there's only two of them so we make both numbers what are my two numbers they have to go in order would you agree that those of the two points where my slope is equal to zero everywhere else this is also continuous everywhere you're either going to be increasing or decreasing how we find that out we take a number here and we plug it in where am I going to plug in a number here to the function or to the first derivative in this case the first Der that's why I have a first derivative right there right that says I'm talking about increasing and decreasing why don't you do that pick a easy number pick like -2 plug it into your first derivative so if I were to do this off to the side I do like okay I'm plugging in fime of -2 this one I definitely would pick zero this one I'd probably pick frime of two and I would plug those things in and I don't care about the actual number I care whether it's a positive number or negative number that's what's telling me what to do here so plug in -2 if I plug in -2 I get I don't something big minus something small positive you got positive 9 right I don't care about N I care whether it's positive or negative that's the key plug in z i get 0us 3 what's that negative don't care about what what the value is just positive or negative how about two posi positive what's my function going to be doing in this interval increasing or decreasing increasing why would you say that slope this is a slope right you plugged in the point this is the only places where the slope could Poss change right that's it because you found the zeros so it's either it's going to be consistent for those intervals so this says my SL is positive that means my function is increasing my slope is negative that means my function is decreasing my slope is positive that means my function is increasing again hey are these relative extremo which one would you say this is a relative Max or think about what the function would have to do to get that what would the function have to do it have to climb and then fall what is that just this part just this part that's a Max climb Then Fall what's this one fall and climb you see what I'm talking about so we know that right now because of this this is going to give us we don't know what it is exactly because that's just the x value we have to plug in find the points that's going to give us a relative Max this one's going to give us a relative min would you tell me how I find those points how would I go from here to actually get in the because right now I just have the X right so I know my relative maximum is going to happen at-1 comma something right and my relative minimum is going to happen at one comma something how do I find something not my slope function not my first derivative because that would give you zero that's how we found them in the first place but my original function if I take these and plug them into my f ofx f of1 f of one what now no no that was a slope that's right so original function plug in ne1 here 1 + 3 + 1 what do you get three yeah three do the minimum 1 - 3 + 1 1 oh I did right so can you tell me what's the relative maximum what's the actual relative maximum three three where does it occur at the point -13 do you understand the difference what's the relative minimum it happens to occur at the point 1 1 are these absolute maximums and absolute minimums no I haven't even given you a close right and this is a polom that looks like this that's what this does it goes up down up there's no absolute Maxum in but there's a relative Max and there's a relative Min those things are important have the absolute when you have a set closed it's closed you you will definitely have that but that's the only times when we have an interval no we we could have uh x s d down up right so you really have to know the polinomial are dealing with uh we'll try one more of these next time but do you have the understanding of of what this kind of goes on how we feel okay with this so far all right okay so uh moving on we're still talking about first derivative test and what the first derivative test says is can you find critical numbers and determine whether or not they are relative Maxes and relative mins how to find critical numbers the same old thing we're going to take a first derivative we're going to set it equal to Z and we're going to solve it so take your first R of that thing right there and set it equal to zero for me would you do that for me real quick if you haven't done that already go for it what' you get 5X you all got 5x to 2/3 all right minus you said what now 10 good show hands tell me we got that good deal now that right there is our slope of course that's our first derivative when we set it equal to zero we'll find the places where the slope is zero or a horizontal tangent line those are defined as our critical numbers so we have this set equal to zero so far so good now how solve that factor out the 5x very good and you choose the smallest power not the largest one the negative 1/3 which you want to factor I think I showed this to you one time before right so we will factor out the 5x to the - 13 once you end up getting factoring means dividing dividing means you're subtracting exponents check it out you've got well 5x to 2/3 / 5 x 1/3 there's no more 5 x^ 2/3 - - 1/3 is X to the first Power did you get x to the first Power not 1/3 first Power yes no minus what happens if I factor out 5 x 1/3 there how much do I get cool that's the correct factorization if you want to check your work you distribute you see you had the right thing how many were able to find that one good very good now can you verify something for me real quick can you verify that we actually have a denominator on this problem why do we have a denominator on this problem uhuh so really what you have this is not on the numerator in fact what you have is 5 x - 2 over a cubot of X can you you see that now here's one thing I was talking about we're we're at the point right now where we can make our critical numbers we're going to find those things but there's one thing you got to realize whenever you have a denominator the value that makes your denominator equal zero also has to be on your critical number does that make sense to you it's got to be there even though that's a denominator and some of you might go oh well zero product property right because you have something time something equals z well yeah that's true but realize what this is this is actually one over the cube root of x you follow me on that that's why I'm giving it to you this way so that when you come up with your problems you get the right critical numbers so let's go ahead and make our first derivative test remember that's the table and on our table we're going to do critical numbers critical numbers occur where the function is equal to zero in our case x - 2 = 0 and where the denominator equals z now that that's going to be an undefined point for our slope but it might change increasing to decreasing something like that so we'll also have the cube root of x equals to zero ladies and gentlemen raise your hand Fu okay I'm getting those points so where the numerator equals z is where the function will equal zero where the denominator equals zero is going to be some undefined points per slope right that that could be the case so we we need to have that up here somewhere we have interesting things that happen there well let's go ahead and do that uh we're going to get x = 2 we're going to get x = 0 well some critical numbers now something may or may not happen here but it might how many regions do we have regions so we're going to check a point in each of a number each of those regions this one you'd probably pick a negative one this one you probably pick one this one you probably pick three so let's check those now my question is where do I check them do I check them in my original or in my first derivative original will give me points first derivative will give me slopes the slope should will tell me increasing or decreasing which is what I'm looking for you remember that this is supposed to give increasing and decreasing right so do I plug in in my original which gives me points or my first derivative which G me slopes first derivative that's why it's called the first derivative test so take some numbers here frime of1 frime of 1 frime of three and we're plugging it into well the first derivative because what I what I know is that if the slope is positive I'm increasing if the slope is negative I'm decreasing that's where we want to that's what we want to find out excuse me hey when you plug in negative one what do you get you get a positive number okay because we have a negative number over a negative number that's going to give you a positive number did you get that as well so I don't care what the value is as long as you know it's positive that's going to be a plus are you with me on the plus let's plug in one when you plug in one do you get a positive number negative number who who got negative you got negative anybody else get negative number are are you seeing I'm getting a lot of people who aren't saying anything are you getting where the the positive and negative are coming from Okay negative very good we' get Negative over positive that's a negative when you plug that in try that on your own plug in the one here you're going to get -1 * 5 that's 5 over POS 1 that's neg 5 that's a negative you still okay plug in three when you plug in three you're going to get a positive * a positive that's positive over a positive cubot of 3 is going to be positive right I don't really care what it is as long as it's positive or negative that's going to be a positive show hands how many people feel okay on the plus minus plus do you see why the zero was important there that's pretty important right it shows you a change even though this was on a denominator you had to have that so you got to have that is part of your critical numbers it can show a change between increasing and decreasing now what do all these things mean the plusus plus what does plus mean for Us increasing very good what does minus mean decreasing what does plus mean again increasing so our graph is going to be increasing I don't know how I don't know whether it's like this or whether it's like this that's concavity but I know it's going up then I know it's going to be going down then I know it's going to be going up again right now are these things relative Maxes or mens well that's a tricky question when we have a denominator because we don't know what's defined and what's undefined you follow me on that so we're going to have to take a better look at that later on WE we'll do the second derivative test right now I'll show you how to combine those things and then we'll start talking about curve sketching and what happens whether these things have ASM tootes or not does that make sense now I'm guessing that can you plug can you actually plug in zero you can right yeah zero that is actually that's a point that's a defined Point our slope's not defined but that is a Define point so if you pluged in zero you're going to get a relative what is that going to be when you're going up and going down it's relative Max what's this one going to be relative Min so that does actually work for us in this case but I'm going to show you how to figure that out in association with the second second derivative test let me get that do you feel okay with first derivative test what's the idea take the first derivative set it equal to zero find your critical numbers and then plug in some values for every interval that I'll tell you increasing and decreasing that's the whole plan you follow now let's take a look at the second derivative test 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 3.4:  The Second Derivative Test for Concavity of Functions
tell me something if the first derivative has to do with slope and the slope has to do with increasing and decreasing what does the second derivative have to deal with good because the second derivative is how the slope is changing whether the slope is increasing or whether the slope is decreasing that's going to give you the shape of your curve concave up or concave down let's just recall how how that works uh so little refresher if your second derivative is that means positive your second derivative is positive what's that mean concave which way up oh that means your slope's increasing right slope increasing does this or well or does this if you're going downwards but it's going to be concave up well that means that if your second derivative is negative your slope is decreasing that's going to be a concave down shape what would happen if your second derivative equal zero good not necessarily an your second derivative equals zero it's a possibility that you're changing concavity there if you're second R is positive you're definitely concave up right your second R is negative you're definitely concave down what do you call that when you well if you switch from concave up to concave down which we can do right concave up to concave down that's a switch and somewhere in there the second gr of must equal zero right that's a that could be a switch and concavity does it have to be not necessarily you need to check for it but it's a possible concavity change and what do you call that right this is a possible inflection or a p at a possible inflection point so let's find out right now how to find some inflection points that's our whole goal for the rest of our day and then tie these things together so how to find inflection points we're going to be using the second derivative test the second derivative test is going to very much mirror the first derivative test what do you think the first thing you're going to do in the second derivative test is second we find the first derivative yeah and then second Geniuses all of you very good yeah you're going to find the second derivative so second derivative test says of course find the second derivative why are we looking for the second derivative that kind of tells you right that tells you it says if you if you set the second derivative equal to zero and solve for it you're going to get all the places where you could possibly change concavity you follow me where that equals zero then you're going to test some intervals just like you did before where you're positive means you're concave up where you're negative means you're concave down that gives you the way that you're changing your curve whether you are down or up so we very similar thing you take the second derivative you're going to set it equal to zero for your possible inflection points set equal to zero for your Pips it's fun to say too pip classic and then you're going to make your second derivative table here's what the second derivative table looks like and you're going to see why it looks this way when I when I put them together finally you're going to have a number line that represents your graph just like you did before with your with your first driv of test just like this and I left this on the board for reason so you could compare this first driven test goes on the top of your graph right the second derivative test we're going to put right below it on the same number line that's going to give you two things at once it's going to give you increasing and how it's increasing it's going to give you decreasing and how it's decreasing it's going to give you relative Max and Min and your deflection points it gives you everything right there so second Dera of test looks like this the possible inflection points go on the bottom of your number line on the bottom of your Gra gra basically you put all of your possible inflection points and then just like we did for our first derivative test we're going to check a number in each interval here and here and here we're going to do that where are we going to do that in the original function in the first derivative or the second derivative this is the second dtive test right we better use a second der because that's what's going to tell us the concavity so we're going to find the sign of each interval by using fime of X I'll write that out for you find the sign I don't care about the value but the sign is important find a sign of each interval by using fpre of X second gr would you like a couple examples on this are there any questions before we we do that does it make sense why this is going to work firsted gives you relative maximum second gives you concavity so inflection points will tell you the distinction between the concavities that's how we're going to use it so let's do the second derivative test let find the the points of inflection if there are any for this next function find inflection points what does it entail finding inflection points what are we going to have to do for inflection points second so let's all take the second derivative right now go for it take the second derivative once you've taken the second derivative set it equal to zero solve for it hopefully you all got that for your first derivative did I do that right do you get the same thing okay then we take a second derivative what would this give you by the way what's the first derivative give you SL increasing slope it would give you a possible relative Max in which is increasing decreasing that's what that would give you not talking about that right now we will in the future but for this I'm just talking about inflection points so second derivative is where we need to be you get 12x^2 - 24x as well what are we going to do with that what now pull out 12 set it set it okay set equal to zero first yeah then we're going to factor do whatever we need to do to solve this by solving this we're finding the places where the second der equals zero that means it doesn't have a concavity that's going to give you every possible inflection point yes no how many possible inflection points do we get not just one right not just that one you also have that zero so x = 0 x = 2 now we get to make the second derivative table looks very similar to the first derivative test we only have a second derivative here and we're going to put both of our possible inflection points on that graph it's got to be in order it's in the order of a number line because the graph is in the order of a number line so the zero has to come first and the two next and these are our Pips remember that's a possible inflection point how many intervals do we need to check three let's check all three we're going to check them in which one the original function the first derivative or the second derivative because that's concavity and we're CH talking about concavity here so why don't you check that I would probably check negative one I check one and I check three so give that a try remember I don't quite care about the the the actual number I care whether it's positive or negative that's what's key F Prime of 1 1 and 3 we're going to plug those into our second derivative we're going to see whether it's positive or negative so negative one looks like we're going to get positive cool how about one how about three what's that tell you in this interval are we concave up or concave down don't say concave up right concave up yeah this is not concave up concave this so we are concave up true shape this way up down up and we're talking about concavity so concave up down up I don't mean increasing decreasing right we talked about that earlier increasing means the function is going up concave up means the way it would be going up or the way it's going down that's the shape of the graph not necessarily the way you're going higher or lower how it's shaped that's the difference now question is that an actual inflection point does the concavity change basically yes from here to here does it change then that's an inflection point what if that had been plus and that had been plus would that be an inflection point that happens occasionally it does uh of not often I mean often it's like this especially pols you get this a lot but if it goes concave up to concave down that's certainly not a possible anymore that is an inflection point is this an inflection point if I look at you long enough you're going to change your answer maybe I don't know I P under pressure concave down to concave up did it change then that's certainly inflection point by the way is that my inflection point no that's the x value for my inflection point let's find the inflection points themselves so I want 0 comma something and 2 comma something because that's my x coordinates of my inflection points I have zero and I have two how do you find points do you still use the second derivative do you use the first derivative or the original function so plug that in and then find out what those numbers are that's going to give you the inflection points themselves so second der tells you concavity but to find the points you're going back to your original function tell you what why don't you guys handle the two I'll take care of the zero sound like a plan be nice to you guys geez I hope I can do it now it's a lot pressure did you get 012 mhm cool those are my two inflection points came from zero and two those are the points we knew there were inflection points because the concavity changes there Rich feel okay with this so far good deal let's try one more then we're going to wrap all this stuff together you ready for it one more but I'm going to have you do most of it so let's start with g of X same question we're going to find inflection points uh x -1 to the 1/3 what are you going to have to do to find inflection points for this nasty looking function huh what derivative first or second why don't you find the first derivative first that might be a good good starting spot find the first right now let's make it prettier and then I'll have you do the second der so go for it so first derivative what do you need to do for the first derivative here Ru chain rule or general power rule how however you speak about it that's fine but you need to know that you're going to do the 1/3 do you change the xus one not right now to which power yeah don't forget the power uh people have notice on your homework you're doing the 1/3 but then you you ignore the power that's kind of a big deal right make a big deal for you so -23 good and then that's it so far so good ends up being that that was actually it because the derivative is one but I do need to show the work 1/3 x -1 to the 2/3 * one because that derivative of x is one so that that's that's done that's our first Der did you make it that far okay now you have an option that was like five people did you all make it that far yeah okay you're getting lazy about your hand raising aren't you you could have the option of moving this down to a denominator right to positive however that's going be a little bit more difficult to take a derivative of so with derivatives leave it that way until you get your second derivative so from right here do you see you can just apply the general power rule again go ahead and do that take your second dtive from right here if you haven't done so already I'm seeing 2 nths you seeing that too to [Applause] the of course that was a general power rule or the chain rule but the derivative of that inside piece that's still going to be just one for you so let's make this thing a little bit prettier how we make this thing a little bit prettier since that's a one this will be -2 over 9 cube root x -1 to the 5th that was a lot of math right there can you follow that you're sure did a lot of stuff in our head we took the derivative and made sure it was one so that's not changing anything that's pretty much gone -2 stays on the on the numerator 9 is on the denominator that negative exponent that's power over root but it's on a denominator power over root you good about that one what do you do for the second derivative test okay so zero now this is interesting when's the numerator going to be equal to [Music] zero it's not it's a constant so you don't get any values from the numerator here that says that nowhere are you going to have an nowhere are you going to have a a point on the numerator that's going to make it equal to zero you're not going to have that value however we do have some some points on the denominator do you see that we're going to have to have that as well since that's on the denominator we okay where is this going to be undefined where do we have an undefined second deriv that could also give us a change in concavity let's look at that where yeah it's nicely facted for you right x - one that's the only thing that could possibly give us zero on the bottom is x - one so we know that from here x - 1 = 0 that's going to give us a possible inflection point do you feel okay with this so far let's make our table up there's only one number so with our one number we've got x = 1 that means there's only two intervals to check we can check zero for one of them we check or whatever you want to check I would probably check two that's a nice number so if we check zero we're going to check it in where the original functions first derivative or second derivative that'll give us concavity so let's let's all try that remember I really care about positive negative that's what I care about so when I try zero into my second derivative I'm going to get oh my gosh negative positive I let's try it what's 0 - one to the 5th power still negative cube root still * 9ga over a negative gives you a positive that's concave up that's the shape of that now let's do the second one do the second one if I do the second one so F of f Prime 2 plug in two give you kind of a nice number 2 - 1 is that's positive fth power cube root * 9 netive positive concave down is that an inflection point is that a spot where we're going to change in uh concavity yes yeah we're going from concave up concave up concave down yeah for sure now find the point all you got to do is plug that number in to find the actual inflection point so I want an inflection point it'll be one comma something where do I plug it in original one that gives you points so plug in one you get 1 - one that's zero can you take a cube root of zero is that okay zero inside of a radical always fine zero that's your inflection point so this goes back to my original function G of one and that's how we did that Z by show hands how many people feel okay with our second derivative test yeah know good all right you ready to put it together do it y let's do both the first and the second derivative test on this next function and see what it actually means it's going to be kind of interesting by the way this is the start of how you would graph a function without a calculator even some nasty looking functions you can do it with this stuff all right I'll show you the the end all of this in section I think 3.6 two sections how you do curve sketching in general curve sketching of anything that you really want to and we'll be able to use all this stuff together this is like the second little baby step we have two more steps to make okay we're going to do both the first and second derivative test but I want you to do most of it so right now can you please perform for me the first derivative test what I want to see is first derivative set equal Z find my my critical numbers and make the top portion of my table do that did you get that for your first derivative okay did you solve it all the way down you able to factor it I hope to me it looks like we should be getting x = -2 and x = 4 by show hands how we've got x = -2 and 4 good you just found your critical numbers that's fantastic the critical numbers stand for the places where your slope could be zero where you could possibly be changing from increasing to decreasing so right here on our on our first year of the test we got okay X is 4 we got X is -2 we're going to get -2 and we're going to get four that's our first derivative test now we get to plug in some numbers so why don't you do that on your own plug in some values for each interval I want maybe -3 here maybe zero here and maybe five here they doesn't have to be those numbers with something in that interval remember we're plugging these into our first derivative not the function that gives you points the first derivative is going to tell you slope which is increasing or decreasing has anybody plugged in3 plug that in yet what did you get positive hey by the way in this context what does the positive mean does it mean concave up concave down increasing or decreasing so the function is going to be going up for this whole interval from negative Infinity to2 it's going up increasing um how about for zero I think I probably do that decreasing increasing yeah show H how many people made it that far did you interpret it correctly for increasing decreasing increasing so here's how this graph look you already have a good picture don't you you know this graph is going to this watch it's going to start from NE infity it's going to go up increasing till it gets to xal ne2 then it's going to stop well not stop reach climax there then it's going to go down till you reach four it's going to go up for you with me on that that's how this graph looks now we don't really know whether it does this or whether it does this something funky you know the shape of that curve is going to be important for us as well that's where the second derivative test comes in so so we've completed the first dtive test told us increasing decreasing increasing we probably have an idea because it's a polinomial that is going to be concave like this and like that but we need to verify that the second derivative test so right now take your second derivative and do the second derivative test I love second der sometimes don't you love second derivativ sometimes so nice except when they're like that I know but uh quotient rules oh my gosh they're horrible but for pols love those things hopefully you got xal 1 as well yeah so we're going to put xal 1 notice how when we combine these ideas it is one number line because it's one graph that means you got to put this in the right spot I can't go xal 1 yay no that doesn't work okay you got to go in between these numbers it's like it's drawn to scale okay it's it's your graph so put it in between the -2 and the four it's a number line after all now if x = 1 tells us our possible inflection that's what that is let's go ahead and let's plug in some values for each interval and find out whether we're concave up or concave down will we plug these into the first derivative the original function second derivative which one second Dera will give you the concavity so take some numbers here probably zero and two plug them into the second derivative and tell me what you get okay negative so we plugged in zero you got6 all that's negative for sure does that mean concave up or concave down this one good because if you plug in something like two you're going to get 12 - 6 that's positive 6 that's positive concave up so we plugged in numbers in the first derivative to give us increasing or decreasing we plugged in numbers in the second derivative to tell us concave up concave down uh true or false we have two relative extrema true or false two relative extrema relative extrema means a relative Max relative men do we have two of those things yeah one's a relative Max where's the relative Max at x equals what number the relative Max at -2 you see thega -2 it's going up it's going down picture that up down that's has to be a relative Max uh where's the relative Min do we know the value of those things not yet but we're going to uh true or false we have no inflection points where is our inflection point one okay here's how this tells us to if you read this it reads like a graph it says check it out you're starting out you're going up right increasing how are you going up concave down wise so you're going up concave down you're going to reach a point look at that concave down going up you're going to reach this point it's still it's going to start decreasing are you still concave down yes until you come to this value then you're still decreasing but you're starting to be concave up you see the change there concave up then you're going to reach this point Ah that's going to still be concave up for the rest of the way concave up but now it starts increasing again so this reads like your graph does increasing but concave down then you're going to be decreasing but still concave down tell you get to here that's your inflection point concave up but still decreasing and then concave up increasing the rest of the way that tells you not only whether you're going up or down but how you're going up or down it would be different if it was like this right increasing concave up that would be different didn't decrease concave up that would be different it would be a different looking graph so this tells you both of them and we'll get a handle on how to do this in section 3.6 all the way through how people feel okay with this so far we've neglected one thing we haven't found the points so I want you to find your points right now do the relative Max relative Min and the inflection point where are you going to plug those numbers into Good original will give you the points see we said max was at -2 something minimum was at four something inflection point was at one something does anyone have the neg -2 yet 50 50 double check on that 50 60 60 wa 60 well it's 10 right I mean who cares okay how about the four the four anyone do the four 4 48 double check yes yeah 48 perfect 48 and the one six six double check six okay tell me what is my relative maximum what is it though 60 60 is the relative Max where does it occur at xal -2 what's the relative minimum good where's that occur cool the inflection point says one six that's where the point is that's where the concavity is changing feel okay about this so far now before we can put all this together we have to talk about one more section it's kind of a long section you see your favorite part we're going to go back to limits for a little bit your fav we're going to talk about limits at Infinity you see we haven't done that we've talked about limits going to a point but we haven't talked about what would happen if well we did a little bit we said what happens if I'm going like this that goes to Infinity but what happens if I take my function and go that way forever or if I go that way forever does it keep going up does it keep going down or does it tend to go to some number we're going to tr we're going to find that out with limits in this section so in 3.5 that talks a little fast so we still have some time 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 3.5:  Limits of Functions at Infinity
3.5 we're going to talk about limits at Infinity I'll start off with just a little bit of a recall here do you [Music] remember if the limit as X approach a number of f ofx equal plus or minus infinity do you remember that that gave us an ASM toote so basically when you could not cross out the problem on your limit you had an ASM toote when you could cross it out it's called a removable discontinuity is called a hole this right here will give you an ASM toote at the value a and we had two cases really we have this case well we get went to the same Infinity positive Infinity on both sides and we said the limit existed the limit was positive infin there or we had this case where one went up another went down we said the limit didn't exist there one's going to positive Infinity as we go from the left one's going to NE as we go from the right and we had a way to actually determine this if you remember uh how did we determine where we had holes or ASM tootes s test would do this but how do we find out where all this stuff happens let's pretend we had a rational function rational functions have denominators how do you find these things denominator it's a and if you can't okay let me give you an example will this have some discontinuities to it absolutely where at zero 1 three which ones zero is zero going to be a discontinuity what do you think zero no zero is fine Z over numbers okay that's okay uh where are discontinuities going to exist 3 one why good because if a denominator equals zero you have a problem right that's how you find discontinuities that's what I told you a domain from a long time ago so what do we do to find discontinuities denominator equals z that's how we do it we we said denominator equals z we solve it down uh we're going to get either holes or asmp tootes do you remember when we get holes and when we get ASM tootes okay maybe we'll refresh your memory on that next time so if you'll recall when we take a limit of a function as we approach some number and it goes to Infinity we're going to have an ASM toote we're going to have either an ASM toote where the limit exists as they both go to positive Infinity I didn't draw the case where they both go to negative infinity or where one goes a positive one goes a negative and then we find that with the sign analysis test now there were two cases where discontinuities existed we had holes and we had asmp tootes do you remember those the holes in the ASM tootes the holes was what was called a removable discontinuity what it meant was that only a single point is missing from that function one little single point that was what defined a removable discontinuity and it exists when the numerator and the denominator equals Zer at the same time why was that the case well if both the numerator and denominator equal zero at the same point you're going to have a factor of x minus that value that you could cross out remember Crossing out those those problem areas that was a removable discontinuity now or a hole if we don't have that if the numerator equals a number and the denominator equals zero and you cannot cross it out and you can't simplify it it's not removable that means we have an ASM toote so case two is where we had the ASM toote A vertical ASM toote A vertical asmt this is when you can't cancel out I know you love to use that word cancel out right where you can't cancel out the discontinuity or you can't remove it Let's do an example here real quick okay let's do an example can you tell me where discontinuities exist so any discontinuities how about x equals z is that a discontinuity or not is it okay to have zero on top of a fraction sure that's zero that's a point uh give me one disc continuity one one would work sure because if I plug in one I'm going when to get zero in the denominator that's a discontinuity you follow me so x = 1 will be a spot at which we will have a discontinuity give me another one someone left hand side of the room what do we have3 would be another one sure now let me ask you a question about x = 1 x = -3 are they holes are they ASM tootes is one a hole is one an ASM toote what do you think and the question is can you cross out where the discontinuity happen so basically can you cross out the x -1 can you cross out the X+ 3 so are those holes or ASM tootes those are both ASM tootes both of them now stop for a second just watch what if I had done this please which one would be the ASM toote in this case that would be the ASM toote here and that would be a removable discontinuity or in other words a hole do you follow that okay good so I'm going to change it back to this this is an Asm toote and that's an ASM toote if I have just x x + 3 and x -1 those are vertical ASM tootes do you recall how to find out what the limit is around those do you remember that yeah signalysis is how you do it you'd put the3 and you know it's going to be ASM toote because we just talked about that it's going to be ASM toote there and you put POS one and you know it's going to be an ASM toote and then all you have to do is plug in some numbers for those intervals because look it look if it's an ASM toote look at the board here real quick you know it's going to be one of these cases right it's either going to go this that or be opposite so it's going to be one of those all you have to do is plug in numbers if it's positive it's going positive if it's negative it's going negative same thing in here positive positive negative negative same thing here positive or negative now now there's one thing you have to be careful of one very important thing for us right now do you see that the numerator will equal zero at zero that Point's not give me an ASM toote but it will it will change the the sign of your fraction so you're going to put a little marker in here at zero and the only reason why you're going to do it is because a number in this region could potentially be different than a number in this region concerning the sign does that make sense to you so that's a separator because if you just plug in zero you're going to get zero right that doesn't tell you positive or negative that could be a case where you're switching from positive to negative so you have to put that plug in a number here and plug in a number here and that'll tell you so it's like you have just three intervals but that's a separating marker which says I can't plug in just one number here I need to plug in two different numbers so you only have two ASM tootes there's not three ASM tootes but it's like yes like you're testing four intervals okay you okay with this why don't we see what happens uh why don't you plug in ne4 somewh how about this uh U2 rows do -4 U2 rows do1 U2 rows do 0.5 and you two rows do two okay can you tell me that have you already done the two when you have them let me know it's negative so you plug you plug it into here right you got negative I don't care what the value negative do that uh these two rows have you plugged in negative one negative really negative positive positive how about5 positive POS negative how about two here's my question will the limit exist will the limit exist as we approach3 from the left we're going down from the right we're going up does it exist heck no how about at one nope from the left we're going down from the right we're going up if they had been like this both going up both going down sure how would this question trick question uh does the limit exist at zero absolutely that's a point oh yeah there's no as tote there right that's the point liit does exist at zero trick job take it job feel okay with this so far could you do the same thing with something like this the same thing with something like that can you tell me where discontinuities exist on this problem where would they exist on this problem do you need to distribute all this out to tell tell that the only place where discontinuities are going to exist is where the denominator equals zero true so where the denominator equals zero is where this little piece equals zero you follow where is that going to equal zero uhhuh so these are my discontinuities would you say that those are holes or ASM tootes as explain why they're asmp tootes because they can't be deleted okay they can't be removed that's exactly right can't be deleted is what she said but absolutely if even if you factored that could you cross it out at all definitely not so these are non- removable discontinuities those are ASM tootes so how could you find out where those ASM totes go well this says really what we're concerned about is around the one do you see what I'm talking about so from our our chart here we've got two discontinuities we got1 we've got one 1 and 1 and what we're going to do is check where these ASM tootes go now look up here at the board here real quick normally we would check all the asmp tootes follow but which one do I really care about do I care about the negative one why not limit says one so I don't care about that I care about this sure tell me one more point that I absolutely must have up here right now that's zero that zero could be a change of sign so where the numerator equals zero that could also be a place where you want to at least separate your interval it's not going to be an ASM toote but you definitely want to plug in just to be safe a number between zero and one that's what you want to do so try that people on the left hand side want to try 05 right hand side wants to try two for me see what happens around that shouldn't really be able to do it without a calculator honestly U because when you think about it this is going to be a positive number right positive doesn't matter that's positive positive over positive is positive negative really number5 is a positive number you didn't check negative did you cuz we should be checking between this little interval that's why we had that okay5 is positive this is positive positive or positive positive ah ah we this first time I think we've had one of these does the limit exist yes yes it does this limit as T approaches one of that nasty looking function is what can you tell me positive or negative so our sign analysis is important our analysi how do you say that analysis analyses oh that's better our s analyses important for you are they important yeah you got to know how to do those so when you can cross cross out it's very easy those are holes no problem when you can't cross them out you have to have some way to determine where they're going and the way you do that is with a sign analysis just like that don't worry about all the ASM tootes if I don't ask them to for you worry about just where the limit says if I'm asking for the all the discontinuities I'm just asking for the points right this was a little extra for us in that case I just want to see what happened this is the application for a limit I feel okay with this so far all right good now the next question we have to answer is what happens with the limit if x doesn't actually go to a number so for instance X goes to one here right or t in this case a variable goes to to one what if we say I don't want to go to one I don't want to go to two I want to go to Infinity what happens to our function I don't want to go to3 I don't want to I want to go to negative Infinity what happens to our function that's what this next part is all about so the question is what happens in a limit or to a function as X approaches positive Infinity as far as we can we can go or negative Infinity basically X increases forever or decreases forever what happens to our function let's take a look at two examples that are going to give us some insight as to this um you know what let's make a table just to kind of get a a picture of what's going on we'll have X and F ofx we'll start very easily we start at 1 10 100 and then a million let's do it for this one what would happen please if xal to one what would we get one how about if x equal 10 what would we get 0.1 very good or 1110 yeah clearly right one over whatever that number is how about 100 01 how about a million six zeros right five Z five zeros yeah five zeros what if x equal a trillion would it get bigger or smaller smaller small what's it going to is it ever going to reach zero but think about this you're dividing a constant number by Infinity right like when you're a little kid and you go you're wrong well you're more wrong well you're wrong plus 10 well you're wrong times infinity right well if you did divided by Infinity you'd have like you'd have zero you keep dividing by a bigger and bigger number you're going to get zero right one divided by a billion is very close to zero one divided by a zillion not say number number is very close to zero but you keep getting bigger and bigger this quantity is closer and closer to Z you with me on that zero let's talk what negative Infinity what happens as you go closer to negative Infinity well that would be I'm just going to change this that would be negative negative negative negative true negative negative negative negative is it still approaching zero yes as we go to nak Infinity we're also approaching zero what this says is that if f ofx function gets really really close to a number as we approach Infinity then the limit exists so we can take limits as X approaches one of these Infinities if x approaches an actual number remember that idea of really close to that was the idea of that limit if FX gets really close to a number as X approaches infinity plus or minus whichever one then the limit exists okay well if the limit exist what's it stand for what's it mean think about this let's say that you start taking your function and you start going forever in that direction it's almost like a karate move I take karate I know but it kind of feels like it whatever the limit move so if you by the way if you ever try to do the math karate you're going to get you're going to beat up never do math karate so you go this way forever and ever and ever and your functions going into the same number is it ever going to get to that number no let get very very very very very close right what idea do we have that represents that but not a vertical one a vertical one says you're going to get really close to that right but never reach it that's the same idea we have going this way really close to that but then we don't have this idea we only have one because otherwise we don't have a function but we have this idea we're going to get close to a number or close to a number close to a number or close to a number that's a horizontal ASM toote so now we have two types of ASM tootes vertical happens when you have discontinuities that are not removable shake your head nod your head if you're okay with that horizontal happens when you take a limit of your function to infinity and that's the idea horizontal asmt by the way the same rules apply to these limits we're about to do uh the rules for limits as X approaches negative and positive Infinity are the same as before so the same rules apply everything holds the same which means one thing for us consider this what if we take any any 1/x n power do you recall from limits that I can take the limit of the function and then raise it to the power do you remember that that we could pull out the exponent that was one of of our Prime rules that helped us a lot well notice how 1 to the N is always just going to be one right so then this is true that's a true statement that's 1/ n I'm sorry 1 to the N that's one this is X to the N that's x to the N are you guys okay with that statement well tell me something then how much is the limit of 1x as we approach Infinity what's 0 to the N power so that what this says in English is that any function where you're dividing a constant one because you can pull a constant out any constant can be pulled out of that limit any constant by some variable that's being raised or as X approaches to that that Infinity is going to end up being zero it's going to have a horizontal ASM toote at zero 0 to the n or zero does it make a difference if we're talking about negative Infinity let's consider that let's go to negative infinity negative Infinity that means is this still true for negative Infinity absolutely is this still true is 1 /x is X approaches negative Infinity is that still zero zero to that holds true for both of them what this says is that one a constant over any variable that's being taken to Infinity it's going to give you a horizontal ASM toote how people feel okay with that that idea no matter what the power is squar Cube doesn't matter because you're always taking that 1 /x to that power 1/x as X approaches Infinity either positive or negative it's going to be zero zero any power is still zero interesting thing horizontal ASM tootes in each case at zero now before we get into some other computational stuff let me show you one one more idea right now we've done a lot of the so far so there no not really a whole lot of examples we're going to change that in just a minute but I got to talk about one more I want you to think of polinomial let's talk about the limit of a polinomial as X approaches positive or negative Infinity think about what you know what you know about pols would you agree that pols are in one of these four one two one of these four cases pols are either like this like this like this or like that true because think about x s x squ like this does it ever go to an actual number as we go this way does it ever go down or up and go to no pols don't do that pols always have a tail somewhere uh an xq would go this way to that way right X Cub goes this way to this way X2 goes this way X2 goes this way they never actually go to a actual number they're all either going to positive or negative Infinity so as we approach for any polinomial positive or negative Infinity on the x- axis the function itself approaches positive or negative Infinity on the Y AIS let me explain that one more time because I think I lost something as you travel this way on the X your function is doing one of two things going this way forever or going this way forever you follow me on that one that's what I just said okay if you're going this way on the x-axis your function is doing one of two things going this way forever or going this way forever that's what this says the limit of a polinomial as X approaches negative infinity or positive Infinity goes to positive or negative Infinity itself I'll give you some examples of this by the way you're going to notice that I always use positive and negative Infinity that's something I do because I don't like to get confused I I if I say positive I I write the positive that's just way I do it do you have to do it that way no not necessarily but it helps helps me helps me let's let's consider this okay now Infinity is not something we can actually plug in but something think about in fact this one guy actually went crazy thinking about the sizes of infinity because there's different sizes of infinity which is pretty interesting itself but so thinking on Infinity is kind of weird to think about uh but we can do it think about this take a big positive number plug in X Cub you know the shape of X Cub right it's a polinomial it's going to be like this take a positive number and plug it in do you get a positive or negative take a bigger number is it still positive take a bigger number is it still so POS in fact it's getting bigger and bigger this is going to go to positive [Music] Infinity the bigger the positive number I plug in the bigger the positive number I get out let's try this one negative Infinity take a negative number plug it in what do you get take a smaller negative number even more negative plug it in do you still get Negative do you see that this one's actually going to negative Infinity further we go l on the number line the further we go down on the Y AIS and that's what that says the further you go left the further your function drops that's what that's saying does that make sense to you how about this one x s take a positive number plug it in X squ where are you going up or down up positive Infinity so the bigger the positive number the bigger the positive number try that one though take a negative number plug it in what do you get ah a positive cuz x s takes that number and makes a positive so even though we're going to the left our function is going up that's why x s looks like that right it's going to go up on both sides this is also positive Infinity show it hands how people feel okay with our our limit ideas so far good all right all right by the way this kind of an interesting little note also did you know did you know that the behavior of the polinomial itself will follow the behavior of the leading term did you know that I'll explain that in a second sorry I'll say this way limits of a polinomial will follow the behavior of the highest highest power of term polinomial nothing else Pol let me give you one quick example because I think you'll really handle this pretty well let's say that I want to talk about the limit as X approaches negative Infinity of -3x Cub - 2x^2 - x + 9 now here's what you can't do what you can't do is go oh let's see uh negative Infinity cubed Infinity * negative that's positive Infinity minus a positive Infinity that's oh man I if you start doing stuff like that subtracting Infinities that is going to make you go crazy what you need to understand is that all this subtracting and adding the infinities are meaningless the behavior of this polinomial is going to follow the term that has the largest power power the term that has largest power is usually in front it doesn't have to be but it's usually in front of your polom it's this one here's what this little Corr says what this theorem says it says this is going to be equal to the Limit as X approaches of just the -3x Cub don't forget the negative that's important but the -3x CU you know this intuitively in fact when you think about it look at that the power is three don't you automatically know it's going to beur for sure it's going to be doing this a power four would look like this five 6 7 eight you know that right now negatives would be opposite so negative X cubed negative of that no n Negative X Cub Negative X 4th X 5th it's going to do that right you know thatly it follows that leading term term all the rest of this is garbage as far as limit is concerned really when you're talking about Infinity now normal limits no it's not garbage but for Infinity that's the one that matters so consider the the leading term that -3x 3r take we're going to negative Infinity mind you take and do this negative means negative right means a negative number take a negative number plug it in here what do you get out and then multiply it by3 what do you get a positive or negative that's positive so as we're approaching negative Infinity that approaches positive Infinity it's polinomial will go to one Infinity let me do this one more time so you really catch this on you're talking about going to really negative numbers right really negative plug in negative numbers to that you're going to get out negative numbers right but then you're multiply it by3 which makes them positive numbers that's positive Infinity think about Cub if you think about XB it looks like this doesn't it about like that let's see move my arm bit there it looks about like that doing Dance Dance Revolution or something uh it it's this as you go left it goes higher doesn't it as you go right it goes lower that's what this is saying that's what that's saying how many people feel okay with that one I'm not trying to show limits here I'm just ask okay we're going to start using these ideas to actually compute some limits this is where kind of the fun comes in we're back to Computing limits are they hard not really but you need to know not tricks but some mathematical manipulations to do them correctly there's going to be a lot of rationalization a lot of that there's going to be a lot of dividing by things there's a lot of that not hard though you just got to see it a few times okay what about that one let's see if we can do that what about that uh where are we going positive Infinity really big numbers so plug in posit what's 5 * positive infinity infinity positive right minus 2 Infinity okay what's 3 * infinity plus 9 I got you infinity plus one what Infinity over infinity one yes no no you can't do that do you know how big Infinity is me neither so how you supposed to divide and give one you can't you can't do that but maybe we can manipulate this in such a way that this stuff is possible now here's the idea did you know that you can multiply both the top and the bottom of a fraction by anything that you want sure and if you multiply both the top and the bottom of the fraction by anything you want it goes to both of those terms true what that says is this what if I divided every term by X could I do it mathematically is that legal sure mathematically that's fine 5X - 2 3x + 9 let's divide all those terms by X I'll explain where I'm getting the X from in just a minute now some of you can probably see it I'll explain why in a bit you okay with that so far you sure okay now simplify what happens here same thing happens here right do they cancel out or cross out here so I get the limit this becomes 5 - 2x 3 + 9x but I show a hands how many people can follow that algebra down now watch let's take X to Infinity if I take X to Infinity what happens to the five nothing nothing there's no X it doesn't change at all the five is five what happens to the three nothing what happens to 2x really small how small zero zero remember the definition of our limit our limit said as we take X approaches Infinity a constant over X is the first first thing I gave you today really the First new thing said a constant overx to any power goes to what zero that was important we needed that this becomes how much folks everybody how much does this become Z constant over infinity whether it's positive or netive doesn't matter it's going to zero so what this says is this limit notice how I'm going to stop writing limit now I've wrot limit till here 5 - 0 over 3 + 0 that's 5/3 not one 5/3 now is it coincidental is it coincidental that uh by the way this works you do 1X over 1X do you guys see what I'm talking about there what I really did mathematically was this over that do you see it one overx over one overx and that distributed and that basically divided every term by X that's the mathematical way youd show that look at the first look at the first expression the limit of 5x - 2 3x + 9 what's the Le leading term here 5x is a leading term what's the leading term here what are the coefficients do you see that when I divide excuse me when I divide by that X I'm going to get 5/3 everything else is going to go to zero so the lead those are polinomial the leading term is all that really matters for us for that now do you have to show it yeah I'd like you to show it for right now okay as you're going on you know later math classes no problem but but show me that where you getting X from is not that the common X here you're actually only looking at the denominator and what you're going to do is divide every term by the largest power of X in the denominator you should probably write that down now why not the numerator well think about it if your if your exponents don't exactly match up and you start dividing by the largest power in the numerator you could have a lot of undefined things does that make sense for instance if you had this uh X to 4/ X cub and you divide it by x to the 4 You' have other stuff here but if you divide by X 4th that's undefined that's one /x that's a bad thing so it's always by the largest power in the denominator that way you won't be undefined you might be going to Infinity but you won't be undefined does that make sense to you okay another way uh people like to say this I'm not going to write down it's kind of it's a shortcut um but if you're your powers are equal to each other you're going to the coefficient over the coefficient that's what we have here but you can see that that's going to work right x s X2 X Cub no problem if your power is larger on the numerator than the denominator well you divide by this power this is still going to have an X up there somewhere right that's Infinity either positive or negative Infinity if this one is larger than I'm s smaller than this one if this one's larger well then you're going to be going to zero cuz you divide by this one one no X's here x here you're going to zero that's one way you can look at that as well so if the top still has an of course let's try a couple more you're going to you're going to start seeing this very easily it's not going to be something super duper hard what's going to be super duper hard is we going to combine this with some other ideas and little while actually might super duper hard then just super hard not even the duper don't worry about the duper come on that was that was funny that was among others if you were listening to what I was talking about you can probably tell me where this limit is going right off the bat not one third if the powers matched up it would where's the power the biggest that means what we're going to be doing here to show you work you're going to be dividing everything not by x2m but by x to the thir power x to the thir power you follow me on that so this would look just like this you'd have 5 x^2 over x 3r - 4x over X 3r all over everything get divided everything 15 x 3r over x 3r minus 3 x 3r if we do just a little of simplification well look what happens do you see how this power it's still still going to be 5x and this is going to be 4 x² you see the x s this is going to be 15 sure but this is going to be 3x to the 3 we had that that the principles of beginning class for a reason it said any constant over any power of X as X approaches any Infinity is going where folks where Z zero so where's this going Z zero where's this going where's this going oh come on come on everyone got to play along where's this going 0 0 15 0 so this after you stop running the limit would be 0 - 0 over 15 - 0 that's where these things are going it's a constant over X as X approaches infinity negative Infinity but still an Infinity 0 0 0 0 how much is that going to be0 that's zero that says a horizontal ASM toote that's what this is by the way a horizontal ASM toote as you're going to the left are you following me on that now if you did this if you reciprocated this and you divided everything by X squ do you see how you still have an x on the numerator that would be saying you're going to positive or negative Infinity depending on what U what x is approaching let's do one more and then next time we'll start building on this coniss two more two more we get we get three minutes now there again some of you who kind of understand this this concept right now should probably be able to tell me where this is going to approach or at least have a guess where is going to approach okay okay o Battle Royale out well you might want to do the work to make sure but you see it's not going to go to a constant do you see it's not going to go to zero what are we going to divide by X Cub x s or X the largest power in the denominator so show your work don't get lazy on that don't take a guess cuz some of you were guessing right now don't take a guess show your work over X overx overx all over that divide everything by the largest power in the denominator not the numerator I give you undefined spots do you see that if I divide it by X Cub I get it's a whole bunch of undefined stuff can't have that can't do that are you all right with that one so far simplify them you're going to get 7 x^2 - 2x + 1X all over 9 /x - 2 follow me on that now let's kind of think carefully about what happens here what happens where's that go that goes to positive Infinity does this stuff matter no that goes to positive Infinity agreed is x s this is zero but that is a -2 where's that going negative Infinity in fact if you really wanted me to show it to you this way I could could you factor out a negative and get 2 - 9x move the negative up top bam got it do you see it that L you you understand that went to positive Infinity little unorthodox here but you see this goes to zero netive two doesn't change positive divided by negative is a Infinity divid two still Infinity okay now mathematically oh not that doesn't do that that mathematically the way that you could show this is the way I showed you if you factor out the negative it's 2 - 9x right if you take that negative and move to the top of your fraction which is legal to do it goes there that becomes 2 - 9 x that says this goes to Infinity time a negative that's negative Infinity divided by a positive now that's negative Infinity that's what that le as well we show yeah by the way did anything but the highest powers of X have anything to do with our problem here this one and that one was really what what caused this to be the way it was that uh one last thing I'll leave you with just a idea because I want you to look at some of your homework tonight but I don't want you to be completely afraid of it just a little afid that looks pretty nasty but tell me something that I can do with exponents what can you do X not yet I can move them outside is a root a type of exponent then look you could take a cube root of the [Music] limit ah now ignore the cube for a second just for a second though can you do this limit yeah explain to me how you would do this limit what would you you divide by here x which one x s Hey where's this limit going to go from on the inside do you see the 2/3 2/3 and then take a cube root of that so our answer here after you show the work would be a cube root of 2/3 the work you show is is this you show a cube root 2x^2 X2 - 32 all over that's what you show but that's the answer you're get how many people understood today if you okay with it right side people are you guys with this so far yeah okay okay so we're talking about how to do limits as X approaches Infinity now the last example I gave you I think I gave you that one didn't I I said that when you have a cube root it is a power that means you can pull it outside of our limit and says well let's take the cube root of our limit itself now when you do that that's kind of nice right because we know how to take these limits what we normally do is divide everything by the largest power in the denominator that's X squ you would get two that's going to be zero three that's going to be zero you're going to get 2/3 you follow don't forget about the cube root but your answer is 2/3 with a cube root around it I think that's what I gave you last time were you okay with that one yeah now I I showed you that one again because I want you to consider the problem that's just below it can I do the same thing here for instance can I pull out the square root around the whole limit no no because that square root is not around this whole function it's just on the numerator so oh my gosh well what do we do what do we do well let's let's try to stick with the the normal operation of this when you're taking X to Infinity we can't just go well that's Infinity s okay that's still infinity plus 2 Infinity Roots Infinity over Infinity uh one we can't do that but what we did say was maybe we divide by the largest power of X in theat denominator so we're going to look down there what's the largest power of X in the denominator x to the first power so let's divide the numerator and the denominator by X are you okay with that so far well now here's the issue and some of you might see this issue already can I just take this x inside that square root I can't unless I have a square root remember you can only combine combine things if you have the same exact type of root follow because it's it's an exponent you can only put things together if you have the same type of exponent well well that's a problem does any know how to change X into something I can take into that square root let's think about it for a second let's think about that x what do you think but if I do x s I have to change those to x s right is that a problem that would be zero and zero that would be undefined so I can't just arbitrarily change X squ but you're on the right track 2 over two is still One X well I did did that so x s down here we definitely we can't have an X squ I need this to still be a value of x make it a value of x s is a great idea x * X is x 4 that's too much Ian say what now rooot of x * root of x is still X you're close oh you're so close you're so close put that together you want something that equals x true how do you make this equal x do that and they are equal is that equal okay no no but almost that's our idea though I'm going to fix this in a second so here's here's the plan well I know that I need this do you see why I need that that is still well pretty much X almost X and that's going to allow me to take that into that square root do you follow me that's important but the question is is X = to theun of X2 and the answer is no not really because if you think about it why don't you take like a negative number5 is5 equal to theare < TK of5 S no it's not because as soon as you square it becomes positive right so this is not necessarily true what is true is this that's true so if we have to have this there's something that's wrong in our problem right now this is right what is wrong do you see it you don't see it um let me go through the process one more time you knew maybe if I draw in purple it'll make more sense you knew if you you had to do that right but you knew that this wouldn't work so to try to make it equivalent you did this that would go into into the square root however this fails now because this is not equal that's not equal notice you you're trying to divide everything by the same thing right the same thing so if you have divided by the same thing these are not the same thing this is the same thing that's true this is true yes this is not true not necessarily true so are the absolute value important this is almost true is this true well no almost this is true you ready to keep going do you understand that that idea right now you sure okay so when we take the square root of x squ we can't just have X you have to have the absolute value of x and I'll show you why it's important in maybe 10 minutes for right now let's continue working on this problem when you have a square root over a square root that says you can take a square root of the whole entire fraction that's x^2 X2 + 2x^2 are you okay on where the x^2 X2 and 2x squ are coming from that's the whole Sol reason why sole reason why you did that right just to make that in there over 3x over absolute value of x - 6 over the absolute value of x well that's a limit X goes to positive Infinity you're going to have the square otk of 1 + 2x^2 all oh okay okay now we got to deal with that I need your mind to think back to what it means to be an absolute value positive values that absolute value is actually a peie wise function the peie wise function says if x is positive you leave it alone if x is negative you change the sign does that make sense to you if x is positive positive you leave it alone if x is negative you change the sign and that was the whole idea that's the piecewise definition of absolute value did you remember that I think we did here actually well this is how you apply that we are going to have the 3x over - 6 over now you get to change your absolute value of x depending on where you are going whether you're going to positive infinity or negative Infinity where are we going to positive numbers or negative numbers we're going to positive positive numbers say that absolute value of x equals x positive numbers positive numbers say that absolute value of x equals x are you with me on this absolute value of x now you don't need the absolute value you just know that since I'm going to positive numbers that can become the X it might seem trivial like well if it's just going to change to X anyway why do we need the absolute value trust me you need them I'll show you why in a couple minutes okay now like five minutes ra going to feel okay with that so far you see now that we have that those X's do match up those X's are gone you get a limit to positive Infinity 1 + 2 x^2 all over 3 - 6X tell me some nice things that happen since X is going to positive Infinity tell me what happens where does this go not zero one this the one oh one the one goes to one it's constant do constants go anywhere no where's this go where's the fraction go have we lost it all on G you're scaring me people you're scaring me here limits of constants are constants limits of this is not undefined where's X going X is going to Infinity where's this fraction going zero constant over infinity is zero divide a constant by Infinity how much you going to get zero zero think about that come on where's three going three okay where's this going zero don't forget what we did last time this says you're going to do 1 + 0 over 3 - 0 tell me my final answer please what is that are you okay on getting the zero and the zero I think we talked about that last time a constant over any power of X as X approaches Infinity is going to be zero because this number is getting huge and this number is getting huge and those numbers are staying the same that means you're going to have a number over huge a number over huge is zero 13 not the square root of one okay one3 show hands how many people feel okay with that now I want you to consider this why this is important think about it you can change your problem if you want to I'm not going to do the whole example over again I'm not going to give you two examples I'm going to show you with this let's say that that is now negative that means that's negative is this still possible absolutely is this still true absolutely is that still okay yes now at this point something different would happen at this point from here to here you see if we're going to Infinity that means that for our absolute value of x where are we going are we we're not going here anymore we're not dealing with positive numbers we're dealing with negative numbers that means instead of absolute value of x equaling X absolute value of x would equal x that means that this and that would be there do you see the change this would be okay squ right square is going to be positive no matter what that's where our definition came from but this would be different what's 3xx - 6 over well that's a plus that's not really going to affect us because that's being plus Z but this definitely affects us doesn't it that's -3 + -3 + 0 that's 1/3 not POS 1/3 what that says is this is interesting the first time we've had this because if you've been thinking about it you might have said well why do we even take positive infinity and negative Infinity why don't we just do one infinity and consider it a horizontal ASM of the whole way well it doesn't work look at that our first example was positive Infinity right that's that way that was at a horizontal remember what these are a horizontal ASM toote that's a horizontal asot at 1/3 if you go to the left negative Infinity is it at 1/3 no it's a negative 1/3 so our horizontal asmos can be different as it go to positive infinity and negative Infinity that proves it that's different right there how people understand that cool this row you guys right with that all right hopefully that madees sense to you we're going to do um one more example maybe two just to start it off let's try that uh so you something kind of cool interesting that you can do so we give it a try looks awesome to me I don't know about you looks awesome to me let's try ready uh what's infinity to the fourth power Infinity okay cool plus two and the S root of that and then minus so Infinity how much is infinity squared zero he done I love that easy problems yeah oh course maybe coincidentally but I really doubt it we can't do that you can't just plug in Infinities whenever you get a case where you're like Infinity minus infinity or Infinity over infinity something like that you know something bad's happening all right yeah you're not doing something right so you can't ever do that you get infinity over infinity please for heaven's sakes don't put one because that that would have been one right uh we can't do that what we do have to do is manipulate the problem somehow now in this case you have a root you have a root minus something what's one thing we like to do with roots minus something when we can't work on them any other way we usually take to try to rationalize some right now this doesn't have a denominator so make one put it over what put it over one get yourself a denominator then you're going to try to rationalize conjugate conjugate very good conjugate if you want to be fancy about it is it plus two or minus two there by the way good so this sign doesn't change this sign does change and it's over exactly the same thing are you okay with that so far yes no well the denominator has nothing to distribute which is really nice we don't have to do any work up there the numerator just distribute it carefully you know with conjugates your middle term should be bye-bye right your middle term should be gone we know also that it works this way because a square root time a square root gives you the radican that's inside that's nice so our limit to positive Infinity becomes something over the < TK of x 4 + 2 + x^2 the numerator becomes oh what's the numerator become distribute right do you see that on your distribution because you should have those x 4 + 2 we're going to have plus and minus the same exact thing and then we're going to get what's the last thing you see the- x 4 two don't forget about the exponent if you make the exponent incorrect if you make the exponent incorrect it's not going to come out right so you got to really be careful about your distribution don't forget to distribute that last part you got me what happens here that's nice yeah oh that's great I love that two square root of x 4 + 2 + x^2 so far so good okay all right to zero can we do that legally can we just say two over in well I don't know especially if this is a especially if you did this especially if you did that that would be a big problem do you see that that would be an issue so what we're going to do is make sure about it you're going to start dividing by the largest power in the denominator again just like you normally would so what's the largest power in the especially if I gave you this one okay what if that was 2x that would be a big problem this one yeah Scott's right you probably could look at this and go that's two that's infinity plus that's Infinity there's no way that that's not going to be Infinity you got me this is going to go to zero he's right but to check your work especially if you have something like this that might not go to Infinity that definitely wouldn't go to Infinity okay that wouldn't so to check your work to show that what you're going to do is go all right well let's divide everything by the largest power in in the denominator now don't trick yourself here the largest power in the denominator is not X 4th it's not X 4th what is it yeah the way you can think about it cover up the rest of it look at the largest term what's the s root of x 4th it's X squar that's your largest power it's the square root of that because it's inside a square root so divide everything by that I'm making you do this because I want you to see one more time this this setup notice we're divided by X2 if I divide this by X squ is that going to work here is this okay no can I take that inside of that square root okay so think back to what we did this is fine right this is fine that's that's great that's what we like what does this do what now oh okay we got stuck uh oh X of x to 4th would be great did you say that already yeah I was thinking I was my mind was wandering thinking about The Simpsons um so well since this is x s and this is X2 we need to make this equal to X2 but it also has to have a square root around it you follow you can't just do this cuz that's X so change the power is that true now some of you are going to ask me well wait a second Mr Leonard don't you have to have some absolute value here let me ask you this question is this always true that actually is always true no matter what no absolute value needed because you have all positive all positive it's always going to be the same does that make sense so we don't even need that for this case so here we're going to have just wanted you to see that one time 2x^2 all over we're going to have the square root if you think about it this is going to be one plus 2 x 4 do you see the 1 + 2 x 4th yes no yeah we got the 1 x 4 x 4 plus the 2 x 4th + 1 show it hands how many people feel okay getting down to that far oh that's not many let's have some questions if you guys are are not so so okay on this are you okay on rationalizing yeah are you okay on Crossing those things out that should be easy that's the fun part are you okay on dividing by X squ because that is the largest power in your denominator you okay on doing the square root of x 4th cuz that's still x s then we take it inside we have x 4 x 4 that's one 2 x 4 2 x 4 X2 X2 that's 1 where does this go ladies and gentlemen when we're taking it to Infinity where does that go is it okay to have zero on the top of the fraction where's this go where's this go where's this go would you agree that this denominator goes to two so this equals 0 over two or zero you're going to notice in this case if I change that to a negative nothing about this changes I don't have any absolute value nothing changes that says the horizontal ASM toote in both directions is at zero that's what it's going to be you follow me on that one would you like to see one more case yeah so would that be all positive exponents or even exponents would that be the case we just start with the even one there that was I'm sorry was oh I don't know it really depends on what you have I can't say a coverall situation for every time I don't know should we change the problem just a little bit let's change the problem just a little bit all right so what I'm going to do instead of doing a whole completely new one do you have any questions on this we're going to see how it changes if I do this little bit to it that okay if that changes our problem at all let's see the things that change let's go through our problem I'll try to use a different color pen so you see the differences can you still rationalize what's the only thing that changes about our rationalization that's going to be a X2 and x s are you what that so far okay what changes here ladies and gentlemen when I distribute what changes just an X squ you see it' be kind of silly to do the whole example again right it's pretty much the same thing that would be an X squ and this would be an x s you still okay well what happens here then is this is an x s and that's an x s true okay so okay well well hang on a second then well if that's the case are we still going to be dividing by X2 down here yeah because that's still the largest power that's that's not that actually if you looked at at would be x square of x square is X so that wouldn't be the larg power we still divide by x^2 we still divide by X2 but now I have an X2 right there that 2x2 that's right there this would look almost the same except I have an x s there what that means is I have a limit as X approaches positive Infinity of two over this is going to give you one + 2 X2 you know I'll show all the work for you in case having trouble following me x 4 x 4 + 2x^2 over x 4 x^2 X2 are you guys satisfied with that one hopefully yeah okay good this gives you one so we're still at two that gives you one this this gives you 2x^2 and that gives you 1 we're now ready to take the limit ready let the X go to Infinity what happens to our two does it go to zero it didn't last time because we had an overx where's that go where's that go where's that go what is it we've got a 2 over the < TK of 1 + 0 + 1 1 + 0 + 1 that's theun of 1 that's 1 1 + 1 is 2 we get 2 over 2 one did it change yeah so little bit yeah a little bit so that that little change there said we're not at zero anymore we have a horizontal ASM toote at now one so we're going at one for when we to Infinity how many you feel okay with what we've talked about so far such good stuff just kidding allergies are getting to me okay last one is it making sense so far can you follow that Shan you okay yeah oh that's nasty still sure you're okay with that one how about that one little tougher conjugate there's no such thing as conjugate here there's nothing to distribute on the top and the bottom you to take it for just think about it for a no derivatives oh good try though when you anwers derivative good try this one of those 5% oh man yeah close no why it's going to you have a negative under the square root ah so if I take really big positive numbers subtract them from seven are they going to be positive or negative and they're under a square square root doesn't exist that was the easiest problem of the day come on no it doesn't exist so think about your limits I mean you can think of them like that you have a seven minus something huge 7us something huge is something really negative square Ro of something negative is undefined therefore limit does not exist does that make sense now if I did this it's not harder it's the same idea you have seven plus a really big number the seven plus a really big number square that is still a really big number it's Infinity all right so you you can think of that the only problems you really come up with is when you do things like infinity plus or minus infinity infinity over Infinity uh that sort of thing gets sh you can't do those but if you know it's going to infinity or it's not going anywhere that's fine that's okay you can you can consider things like that there's no denominator nothing to divide by you're good does that make sense sense soga infity would this no this is actually oh it's POS yes do you feel okay with our limits have I blown your minds yet today so when you have issues where you're subtracting Infinities rationalize if you have a square root rationalize them if you don't think through the limit what it means to go to Infinity consider the type of problem that you have you already know pols any polinomial is going to go to positive or negative Infinity right we talked about that last time he said well it follows really the leading coefficient or the leading term sorry the power leading term so uh X Cub if it's it's going to go up or if it's negative X it's going to go down things like that happen so be prepared for those limits are there any questions before we continue all right 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 3.6:  How to Sketch Graphs of Functions
so let's talk about section 3.6 curve sketching this is basically using intercepts like x and y intercepts uh your relative Max relative men which are go to extrema and your concavity to sketch a curve to graph it to see a really good approxim of what it looks like without a graphic calculator now yes your graphic calculator will do it for you but to understand why these graphs are shaped the way that that they are you need the calculus you really understand why they are the way that they are should we do an example yeah let tell you what I'll do I'll give you an example and I'll give you the steps as we go through that would that help you so here's your example here's your example and I'll tell you how to do this problem verbatim just exactly like you should all right with every single step step number one when you're graphing any curve is well you want to find out as many intercepts as you can X intercepts and y intercepts that's always a good thing to do right because in most cases that gives you at least an approximation of what you're talking about where you're crossing the y- axis where you're crossing the x-axis so step number one every time you're going to find the intercepts by the way how do you find X intercepts how do you find X intercepts y say it yal 0 y equal 0 so set the equation equal to zero that's how you find X intercepts you set equal zero you solve for x that's going to give you any Roots that's what a root was right when you said function equal to zero and you solve for x you're finding out where it's costing the x axis that's the whole exact idea should make sense right because if you set yal to Z that means you're going to find out everywhere you cross the x axis you believe me now the Y intercept is quite a bit easier by the way you only do this step if it's easy easy easy means it's quadratic or lower or it's already factored for you okay so cubics don't spend your time factoring them um if I give that to you on a test I'll just give you the X intercepts I'll say here are your three x intercepts you follow me on that so if it's if it's easy do that easy means so I know this is recorded so you don't cheat me easy me easy means quadratic linear or if it's already factored for you that's easy everything else cubic or higher is hard unless you can just see a route right off the bat that would be considered easy believe me with be okay if it's easy for y intercepts uh how do you find Y intercept easy really easy to do xal Z so X plug in zero you plug in zero for x and it'll give you Y intercept that's the easy one that's nice you all need to find that for every single one of these if it exists let's try it let's try so this will be step number one I'll try to write every step for you step number one solving for x intercept how do you solve for the x intercept well this is just basic algebra you're going to take your function you're going to set it equal to zero and you're going to solve for x so we will have x + 2 x - 1^2 = 0 can you find your X intercepts from right there that's great that's great because it's already factored for you can you tell me what's one of your X intercepts you'd have x + 2 = 0 x - 1 = 0 because a zero product property so x = -2 very good and x = 1 you have two x intercepts orig I feel okay with that if this been factored for you you just skip it i' give them to you okay uh part two of Step number one is find your Y intercept Y intercept says you need to plug in zero for x and see what you have so I'm going to take 0 + 2 * 0 - 1 squar don't forget to square before you multiply uh what is 0 - 1 1 2times is two you get two the Y intercept is two do you feel okay for for this so far all right step number two step number two applies only to rational functions it does not apply to pols because pols do not have this I'm going to put step number two in a little asteris the as means for rational functions only for rational functions a lot of times with rational functions you're going to get some ASM tootes right you're going to get some holes so for rational pols don't have those it's continuous everywhere you don't have ASM tootes you don't have holes so this is why it's only for rational functions you're going to find all the ASM tootes vertical and horizontal and any holes do you remember when vertical asmp tootes exist denominator equals what and you can't when do holes exist okay so denominator equals z gives you ASM tootes or holes if you can cross it out as a whole and you can't TR out ask to vertical ASM toote denominator equal Z non removable whole denominator equals z removable how do you find horizontal ASM tootes good thing we covered that stuff horse Al Asm tootes occur that's what we the whole last section was about it said can you find the ASM tootes as we go to the right as we go to the left that's what we were finding we're finding horizontal ASM tootes at zeros or at ones that's what that did and so what we're going to do here for horizontal asmt you take the limit some more you take the limit as we go X approaches infinity or X approaches negative Infinity you have to do both of them because you know the limit could change remember that one/ thir right it could change so you got to be careful on that take the limit so do we need to do step number two for that problem is it rational so it doesn't have a denominator we're not going to be able to do that if it had a fraction you had denominator with a variable down there then of course we would be doing that right here we don't so now we're going to go on to step number three step number three is you finally get to do some calculus you're going to do the first derivative test you remember the first derivative test you had a whole homework section on that right first derivative test you said equal to zero it will give you two things critical numbers and increasing and increas and decreasing and that's what you care about right you care about where are my Maxes my mens how am I going up how am I going down that's what you care about first test why cuz it's going to give you critical numbers and increase and decreasing or areas where the graph will increase or decrease hey let's try that now we'll get you know what maybe I'll give give you all the steps and then we'll we'll go through it step number four sorry I'm kind of backwards uh 1 2 3 Just Pretend We're reading a book backwards or something step number four after you do the first derivative test what do you think you're going to do next Geniuses the second derivative test what does the second derivative test give you yep the reason why you do it just like Scott said you're going to do for concavity and for inflection points step number five remember a table ah had you make that has the first derivative on the top second Dera on the bottom that tells you increasing decreasing increas all that stuff and tells you con cavity so basically it gives you a picture of your graph right there that's what you make so make the table these problems you know they're very long problems especi oh my gosh especially with rational they take a long time a very long time uh they're not easy well actually they're not hard they they're very time consuming so they're going to take a long time not going to lie number six at this point you're going to have everything you need all right you're going to have your intercepts that's huge you're going to have any ASM tootes you put those on your graph you're going to have any holes you put those on your graph you'll have your critical numbers and your inflection points what you won't have is the actual points right you'll have critical numbers plug them in find all possible points relative relative Min and inflection find your points from the original function the last if you get the points you get all the areas increaseed and decreas concavity grab it okay we're going to get at least the first first two tests done on this thing we already have the the intercepts we got X and Y we don't need to do step number two CU we're not rational we're going to do the first derivative test now don't fool yourself here yes that looks pretty nasty that you say oh my gosh that's a product rule with a chain rule or a general power rule in it that could get pretty hairy and then have to set equal to zero or maybe be a little bit smarter about that probably easier to distribute that right maybe distribute some of those easier ones first that way you don't have to do all those rules if it was to the six power or something firstly that'd be insane but secondly um you wouldn't want to do that so just go ahead and maybe distribute that so why don't you try that right now hopefully you got that did you get that okay keep working step number one we got step number two we don't need it step number three first thing were you able to get that that's your happy were you able to get that yeah yeah take the first derivative do the first derivative test go for it by the way that a whole lot easier to take the derivative than that right try that on some of those graphing ones right that's usually going to be something doable for you at least doable so try some of that so take the first derivative let's do that together uh everybody what is the first derivative when I when I do that what was it what do I do for first derivative test if I set that equal to zero I'm going to get x equals well I'll show the work on that if you really want me to this will be 3x^2 = 3 x^2 = 1 x = + orus < TK of 1 x = 1 and 1 you okay with that so far okay hey that's the first derivative test that's not too bad let's do step number four step number four is can you do the second derivative test second derivative test says well take the second derivative go ahead and do that now take the second derivative how much is the second derivative oh that's beautiful I love that what do you do with that 6X when you solve for zero what are you finding here inflection points you're trying to find possible inflection points so when you divide by 6 x = 0 these right here are your critical numbers this right here is a possible inflection point let's recap for just a second before I start making the table for you and then we we'll do the table next time how many people feel okay on finding X and the Y intercept feel all right with that good that's that's our basic algebra do you feel okay with our first derivative test and our second derivative test raise your hand youart with that now step number five this is where all your work happens okay all your work happens right here in step five you're going to have what you got from your first derivative you're going to have what you got from your second derivative and you're going to put all of it on something that looks almost like a graph it's a number line what were our critical numbers that we needed soga 1 positive one zero goes on the bottom why does zero go on the bottom second okay so critical numbers critical numbers went on the top that was our first derivative that's what we got right possible inflection points that's from our second derivative that goes on the bottom of our table it has to be in order 1 01 do you feel okay with that so far what do you do now start testing numbers on so every single interval here you follow what number you going to check here and where are you going to check it in the first derivative what are you going to check here what was itative one would work right doesn't matter negative 1 you're going to check it in the okay why don't you go ahead and do that fill that table out for next time because that's where I'm going to start next time if you want to hang out for a second I'll do it right now okay uh for this one if I plug in frime of -2 if I plug in frime of Z I can do that and frime of one I'm doing my first derivative I'm going to get positive I'm going to get negative and I'm going to get positive that means increasing decreasing increasing you follow me on that yes or no okay second derivative I'd try fpre of negative 1 i' try F Prime of positive 1 remember it's just this inter it doesn't mean you can't plug those in for your second derivative that's okay1 gives you negative concave down positive one gives you six that's positive concave up show hands some feel okay with their concave down concave up that right there is a picture of our graph we're done with step five this basically tells you up down up we just have to find some points and we'll graph that next time let's finish that problem we're dealing with basically just a polinomial uh we know that we can take a first derivative pretty easily if we distribute we've already done that we found first derivative test second derivative test we have our intervals of increasing decreasing intervals of concave concavity up and down we also have our relative which one's this Max or Min relative Max relative and good Reflection Point what we don't have is actual points right we need the points now so the steps that we haven't done after you've done your first and second derivative test you've made me the table what I want to see is your your points now I know the X intercepts automatically give us some points basically 1 Z -2 0 those are my X intercepts my Y intercept will give me another one 02 so x intercept Y intercept but then all of my critical numbers my critical points like my relative Max and Men that's more points my inflection point that's another point so you need also give me are you okay on the 1 0 and the -2 0 it's my X intercepts my Y intercept is at 02 that's what we we got those from we did that last time right if you don't remember that look back at your notes or look at that video we did that last time now those were X intercepts y intercepts we also have relative Max we have relative Min and we're going to have an inflection point just one in this case can you please tell me what's the x coordinate for my relative Max the x coordinate for my relative max1 would be the x coordinate from relative Max you follow how' you get the zero plug the original good the original one is what gives you points so to find our points out you take the negative one plug it back up into here or or this one would probably be a little bit easier and that will give you out the yv value you follow me that gives you your your points so this is going to be 1 let's see 1 + 3 two two I think so I don't know tell me it is happens right it's all good what's a little point between friends huh a moot point right right okay - 1 + 3 + 2 4 uh find your relative men what's the x value for your relative Men Please what is that so I'm going to put a one here how do I find the Y value ah look it in that one's going to be that one's inflection point can you please tell me my x coordinate for my inflection point zero Z comma that's an interesting point isn't it not only is it the Y intercept it's also the inflection point so we have that point twice not a big deal you feel okay with the points here's how to label them on your graph what you're going to do just work your way down just like we did with the process start with your X intercepts 1 Z put a point -2 0 put a point those are my X intercepts my Y intercept is 02 put a point relative Max happens at -14 put a point relative Min happens at 1 Z put a that's already there now here's how I like to label these points are you okay on firstly the four points that we get I mean we have 1 2 3 4 we have six of them listed but two we have two pairs of points here's also what I like to do when you have the inflection point you need to label it inflection point that way you see the change in concavity so which one of these is inflection point well it was the 02 one so I'm going to label that inflection point just IP just so you know it's IP for your relative exema your relative Max and relative men what I like to do I like to draw a little dotted line so for my relative Max which is at4 I like to do that that says I can't go above that for this one this this one zero that I know that was a relative men right I'm going to do this I can't go below that I know that my graph is going to bounce off of those those dashed lines do you follow me on that that's what's going to happen here it's going to it's going to we'll follow in our graph go up bounce off hit INF Flex Point bounce off and then keep going forever does that make sense to you so label those things with something like that do the inflection point changes concavity do your relative Max relative Min do little Dash lines that way you know you're not going to go past that you're going to be changing at those those values so let's see if we can graph our our graph if we follow this table and Associate them with these points we should have a pretty good looking graph it says you're going to start out you're going to be increasing which way is increasing this way or this way this way so we're we're increasing how are we increasing concave concave down so increasing concave down increasing this is concave up this is concave down you follow we're increasing concave down it says increasing concave down we're going to go through that point so increasing concave down it's going to be hard to draw that way I tried to do it increasing concave down are you follow me on this I'm going to hit that what it says a relative Max increasing concave down relative Max then I start decreasing how am I decreasing look at the board here real quick how am I decreasing for this interval it says you're decreasing but you're doing it concave down you follow me so for this little interval right there it says xals 0 right says from to1 on the x-axis you're increasing concave down from negative 1 1 to Z 1 to 0 you're decre you're decreasing concave down that's this way decreasing concave down you still okay with that yes no after zero after zero it says I'm still decreasing but now I'm concave up that's that's like this decreasing concave up so that was my switch in concavity I'm still decreasing from 0 to one from 0 to one I'm still decreasing but I'm concave up as best you can after xals 1 that's why I made the point earlier in the class that you have to follow the x- axis right you got to be on that so you go okay after xal 1 I'm increasing again and I'm concave up increasing concave up looks like that that probably should be a little bit more narrow but that's the idea can you get this graph from this picture of the graph how many feel okay with that so follow along the x-axis start from the left work your way right increasing concave down till xal 1 right there we have the point for that for that little interval decreasing concave down right there for this next interval decreasing concave up right there last interval one from xal 1 on increasing concave up and we have our we have our picture now of course it's just an X cubed so we kind of have the picture of that anyway but the double Root's interesting right we were able to find that we able to find all these points that's a pretty accurate graph fairly accurate how many people feel just fine with it all right now we're going I'm going to eras this because take us a long time a lot of lot of board space to do these problems we're going to graph some rational equations you ready for rational rational are harder first because the derivatives are harder and second because you have ASM tootes that's what makes them harder so I'm going to try to get through two today we have about 40 minut uh 30 minutes or so 35 minutes right now so they they take a long time uh we're going to try to get through two oh yeah were there any questions on that now the question is do I do that on purpose H you'll never know I'm not going to rewrite the steps because I gave them to you last time they're on the video if you need to check those out again the steps were 1 through seven Number One X and Y intercept number two ASM tootes if it's rational that's why we didn't have a number two up here three first derivative test four second derivative test five is make the table up six is makeing points and seven is graphed so we're going to follow the same seven step process the whole way through by the way we are going to be deal with some roots on this so if you take get your calculator out I'm going to need some help calculator words um from you on this okay so x^2 - 1X Cub step number one hopefully the algebra type stuff you find your X and your Y intercept so we're we're going to do every step together here x intercept would happen where you set your function equal to zero you follow me set your function equal to zero and then you you solve it well if you set your function equal to zero basically that's just where the numerator equals z the denominator if equals z it's undefined so we really just say okay well even if you want to think this way multiply both sides by X Cub you still get x^2 - 1 = 0 what are my X intercepts say what and one and negative 1 very good you add one take square root or factor either way you're going to x = 1 1 are you okay with that so far you sure so numerator equals z no problem that's how you find your X intercepts for any rational function numerator equals z you got it now Y intercept Y intercept says you plug in xal 0 and you find out an answer what do you get when you plug in xal 01 over that's a problem that means there is no Y intercept and we're going to find out why in Step number two but does not exist I'm going to erase little parts so we we save space but this is from x^2 - 1 equals z that gave us the one and negative one step number two oh step number two is a good one step number two is a good one step number two is where we find out all the ASM tootes now you might be thinking who cares about ASM tootes don't we have increase and decrease the ASM tootes tell you most of what you need to know for your graph they really say here's your your sections here's what you're going to do in those sections basically if you knew the asmp tootes you can almost guess what this graph is going to look like with just a couple numbers so we're going to find our ASM tootes both vertical and horizontal how do you find vertical ASM tootes no not derivatives we don't do calculus till step number three by the way denominator equal zero good when the denominator equals zero you're going to have discontinuities right those discontinuities are either holes if you can cross them out or ASM tootes if you can't so you'd say x Cub equal 0 and x has to equal Z zero can you cross out the X Cub with anything so then what that says is there's a discontinuity a vertical ASM toote occurs where X Cub equals 0 or in other words x = 0 that's going to give us a vertical ASM toote at x equal Z now just careful if you were able to cross it out you would do that okay you cross out that discontinuity you just keep it in your mind that there's a hole there all right you'd have to identify the hole so it's it's a little bit easier in ASM toote you cross out the problem you say there hole exists at this point and you put a hole on your graph does that make sense to you that's what you would do I think I've shown you how you do holes uh I think I gave you x^2 - 4x + two the hole would exist actually minus two the hole would exist at uh I did plus two at two and then you would find that value you put a little circle there and it would just be an undefined little point you follow me on that okay so that's what you would do with holes most of the time I'm going to give you ASM tootes most of the time you will have some holes most time astes how do you find horizontal Li yeah you're right a limit as what as xes so really there's two of them right you got to check both don't just assume that it's going to be the same a lot of times it is but we've seen cases where you have different horizontal Asm tootes hey do you remember how to take limits of uh of that stuff I hope you do because I think that's what your homework was on right hope so how do you take a limit as we approach positive infinity or negative Infinity don't Mumble it say it div by the B div by the highest power very good in the keyword denominator not numerator denominator so we would be dividing by X Cub both here and here if we did that it's going to look identical to this you'll get x2 XB - 1 XB all XB xB can you see that this is going to go [Music] to zero yes no yeah if you want the rest of it here it is I I'm just going to do I'm doing this one right here you got 1X - 1X Cub all over 1 true yes no okay 1X 1X Cub 1 tell me something ladies and gentlemen you need to know this when X goes to Infinity what's this do what's this do what's this do stays at one that's 0 over one that's zero now just think through it think through it is there going to be a difference if we go to negative Infinity this would still work right you still do that you still have exactly this thing you follow me now take it to negative Infinity what's one over negative would be over here right now what's 1 over negative Infinity it's still zero What's one over negative Infinity it's still zero this would still be zero and that's still a positive one cuz you're dividing X Cub by X Cub no matter what it is that's going to be a positive number positive one you follow me on that you sure yes no I see some not like questions are you okay that this is equal to zero yeah okay if it was going to negative Infinity so let me just change the problem here now let's say aha aha ah does anything change is it still zero so where are our horizontal asmp tootes zero both left and right both left and right so horizontal ASM tootes occur at yal 0 both positive and negative Infinity would you mind if I erased this do you need it so I I've taught you how to do the limits you do the limits um also you're going to hate me for just telling you this but you can see it just by looking at the limit where's the power bigger top or bottom that's something over infinity right that's going to be zero where's the power bigger top or bottom that's something Infinity that's going to be zero however you want us if I want you to show it yeah I want you show it but at least you can check your work really quick right so this means as we're going to the right we're going to zero it's going to to left we're going to zero how many people feel okay with what we've done so far any calculus not really just limits let's start doing our step number three what step number three do our first test now I know you all know how to take the first derivative so I'm going to start doing these first derivatives a little bit quicker just stick with me on these derivatives once you would do take your quotient Rule and you're going to have this minus this all over that square still okay so far I I'll show the work if you really want me to low D High minus high D low Square the bottom and we're okay y XB * 2x - x^2 -1 * 3x^2 all over X to 6 yes no yes okay so basic derivatives actually uh the what you do with them later kind of sucks but basic derivatives so far y Prime equals 2x 4 - 3x 4 + 3x^2 over x 6 so far so good distribute deal with those signs you see where the plus is coming from I hope y Prime = x 4 + 3x^2 all over x 6 can you keep going can you factor simplify yes factor out an X squ that is going to make your work later easier would you agree that that is your first rotative l J are you okay on your first R did I've gone kind of quickly through that but I'm assuming that at this point you can do a quotient Rule and simplify it you follow me now have you feel okay with it so far what is this I know it's a first derivative what is it increasing or decreas it's going to give us increasing decreasing because this is a it's a slope and if slope is positive you're increasing slope is negative you're decreasing if slope is zero you have a potential relative Max in you follow me so what we're going to do for the first derivative test is you go okay now I want to set this equal to zero and what we're going to do on this is pick out all the points that are undefined and all the points that have a zero so can you please tell me for my critical numbers that's what we're talking about here for critical numbers critical numbers the first one I see is xal 0 where am I getting x equal 0 ladies and gentlemen that tells you that right that says xal 0 is an undefined point for your slope that could mean that you're changing between increasing and decreasing does it have to no but it could it could mean that do you follow that so you have to have the x equals z make sure you have where the denominator equals zero on your critical numbers and for your inflection points later got to have that secondly you're going to set the numerator equal to zero that's the same idea as over there it's very much like finding Roots numerator equals z is going to give you the actual numbers that makes your slope equal to zero you follow me on that one okay so if you want to multiply by X to 4th you would see the same thing wouldn't you wouldn't you yeah okay how do you solve that I would probably add x s and then divide and then take a square root and you could subtract three divide by1 take a square Ro just more work um but you're going to get some somehow you're going to get x^2 = 3 3 true well that means that more critical numbers occur at plus orus < 3 so I have x = 0 x = < tk3 which is why I had you take your calculators out because I can't do that and negative root3 those are my critical numbers you okay with your critical numbers yes no take a square root of three you have 3 and < tk3 1.7 something what's next now the reason why we simplified this as much as possible is for our second derivative let's go ahead I'm going to do the second derivative why don't you try on your paper as well U see if we can match up the right answer so step number three sorry set number four is our second derivative okay for for oh that's not was bad as you thought huh hopefully not as bad as you thought did you get that far if you're still going still go that's fine um distribute combine like terms Factor simplify you're going to get down to that point let's all let's all make it down to this point are you okay that that is your second derivative you know how to do the second der already that that's that's not the issue with this this problem okay I know you know how to do that your point now is let's find our possible inflection points or the the numbers where we are going to change concavity can you tell me from here the numbers where I'm going to change concavity I'll tell you one of them so possible inflection points I'll tell you one of them one of them is xal 0 how am I getting x equal Z yeah in fact you know what that's kind of a key point for us that was an undefined point from the very beginning right if you take a quotient rule look at that it's going to come back again because you're just squaring it take a a second quotient rule it's going to come back again because you're you're you're just squaring it so that's going to be undefined it's going to be a critical number it's also going to be a possible inflection point where we change concavity it shows up a lot in our problem you okay with x equals z now the factoring is nice for us cuz it's says if you set this equal to zero which is what you're supposed to do you can clear out the denominator we had to include that point because it did make an undefined second derivative so we do have to include it the x equals 0 but now you can say ah 2 * x^2 - 6 = 0 you set the numerator equal to Z are you with me on that one yes no yes okay but the the two does the two do anything for you so if you divide by two basically you're going to get x^2 - 6 = 0 you're going to get x2 = 6 and you're going to get okay yeah I understand not very nice numbers I get it but can you find them yeah now the point is as soon as we do our first and our second derivative we're going to make our table up from our first derivative it said you're going to have something special happen at zero maybe you're also going to have something special happen at the sare < TK of three and the negative < TK of 3 are you okay with the points that we got from the the first derivative everybody are you all right with that negative root3 0 Z especially and the root3 are you okay with that one now the next one says okay you still have from our possible reflection points zero then you have Root 6 Root 6 to the left or to the right of root3 it's actually pretty important to put this in the proper order right so you have to have Root 6 over here somewhere andun 6 now we're going to do what with this after you find those numbers are they hard to find not really not really what do you do now after you you have the3 03 what do you do plug them into theives wait plug that in yeah that's going to give you zero test them original function if I plug that into the original function that will give me points which I'm going to have to do in Step number six interal look you need to know what happens here you know what happens here here here here here here here all those little intervals right got to know which area to plug him into where am I going to plug in points from all these four that's why we have that first Riven and these are going to go into the second derivative so let's go ahead and try that for this one I'd plug in -2 I'd plug in 1 1 and positive2 we do it in the first derivative so if I plug in -2 here so frime of -2 frime of1 frime of one frime of probably pos2 I don't really care about the actual value all right I really don't I care about the sign positive or negative so we're going to take -2 plug it into the easiest one to work with that's this one if I take -2 I know I'm going to have -4 + 3 that's a negative number over a positive number did you get a negative as well yes negative hey hey what's negative mean in relation to this decreas decreasing very good because it's a slope negative slope means decreasing plug in 1 if I do negative 1 I get remember that you don't Square this negative right that says negative x^2 so this will be -1 + 3 that's 2 over it's posi what's positive me increasing increasing don't just say up because that could be misconstrued as concave up I want to say increasing or decreasing how about one let's try one if I try one do you see I'm going to get the same exact thing as negative 1 CU that says1 + that's positive over that's positive so is that a relative extreme this one no that zero actually didn't change right we're increasing and increasing again that's interesting how about that the two negative it's going to be negative yeah for sure you plug in the two you get Negative over positive that's a negative now let's try our our second derivative if we do for those of you who really have the hang of this can you do me a favor right now can you start finding points I think I can pretty much take care of the zero but I'm going to have a hard time plugging in The Root of3 < tk3 6 andun 6 um so if you want to try this as I'm going through the second part if you really get the grasp this left side of the room my left side you guys try the root three and three root3 um you guys try thetive root6 and Root 6 in the original original okay can you do that for me give me to like the first I don't even care the first decimal is fine to.5 or whatever now for our our second derivative we're also going to try some values in these intervals but you're going to plug them into the second derivative so F Prime of that's going to be like -3 double Prime of1 double prime one dou prime positive 3 if I do that if I do that if I take the3 over here that's going to be a positive over a negative I have a negative what's negative mean by the way when I'm talking about second derivative concave down if I plug in negative 1 notice what we do we've got 1 - 6 that's over a negative that's going to be a that's a positive concave up if I try positive one here I'm going to get a negative over a positive that's going to give me a negative and if I try three I have a positive over a positive that's going to give me a positive by I show at hands how many people feel okay with our concavity at this point right are you guys okay with this you guys here yes no so we checked this in the second derivative we got this was a negative interval positive interval negative interval positive interval concave down up down up were these inflection values does concavity change here and here and all all of them actually we had different concavities step number six is you have to find all of your points so right down here I'm going to write my points I know for my X intercepts I'm going to be at 1 Z and 1 Z my Y intercept I didn't have any so that just came from my X intercepts now I also have all all this junk over here so my relative Max and relative Min can you tell me which one of these is going to give me my relative maximum my relative maximum is it going to be the negative root3 or the positive root3 positive this one's going to be a relative minimum so relative Max relative Min the relative Max will be at < TK 3 comma something I don't know what it is of 3 comma something uh someone who plugged in the < TK of 3 about how much did you get 38 38 yeah yeah okay so let's say 04 is that negative4 okay are you okay getting those numbers do you do you remember where I'm getting these numbers from where do I plug in the root 3s the not the first R not the second but the original function is going to give you points are you okay on that so far you sure we're almost done almost done now let's do the root sixes the root sixes are my inflection points < TK of 6 and the square root of six someone who plugged in the negative square root of six how much do you get now this is everything that you need in this little block to graph this so I'm going to erase this cuz we don't need anymore get everything well almost everything I'm going to leave the asent toes because I need those that's going to be important you're going to kind of see what I want from you on this the first thing that you should do put out your asmp tootes wherever those things are so my asmp tootes are at x = 0 xal Z horizontally both right and left and I'm sorry uh y equal Z both right and left and x equals z for our vertical so we know we have some ASM tootes next thing you do put down your points your x intercept is at 1 Z and negative 1 0 your Y intercept ah you don't have one because you have an ASM toote there you don't have that your relative Max and relative Min Square < TK 3 the square OT of 3 is about 1.7 somewhere around there so the relative Max occurs at okay so there's a slight error in class um the numbers that some of the students gave were a little bit off uh here's the correct numbers now we went through this a couple times so of course if you if you watch the video you're like whoa what's what's going on here why are these numbers changing here's where the numbers changing um when you take the root three and you plug it into the original equation which gives you points what you actually end up getting is 38 if you take > 3 plug it into that original equation you're going to get 38 now when you take the square root of 6 you plug it into the original function what you're going to get is34 and. 34 they're very close points now the graph's going to look somewhat similar but you'll notice that on the video I have that as 1 and -1 if you just change that to 0.5 and .5 and just extend that graph even further this is about what it looks like uh the the the picture of the graph on the on the video is just fine um so here's what you you would end up doing you would still have your same X intercepts you would have your relative Max and your relative men you would have your inflection points they're just really close together so our graph as you can see we're still decreasing that's what this means right here decreasing concave down so we're we're dropping and we're concave down that's that's this way also we have this horizontal ASM toote that's that's what that was so important for was to tell us that our function is not going to be going way up like this I can go way down like this it's going to be riding along this x- AIS so it must look about like that not exactly like that but pretty close to that then from this point to this point that's this little interval it says you're still decreasing but you're concave up you're starting your slope is starting to increase your function is still decreasing but your slope is getting more and more uh it's getting larger and larger so we're going to decrease concave up and then right after that point right here it says you're still concave up but now you're starting to increase and what that does is in increases all the way up until you get to zero now at x equals 0 you have a vertical ASM toote which means that you're never going to reach this y- axis all it's going to happen is if you're still increasing as you get closer and closer you're going to shoot up to positive Infinity so that's what the horizontal asmt said it says you are increasing you can't be decreasing you're you're increasing all the way up until x equals 0 that says horizontal ASM toote and you're concave up the whole way now the other picture is it's going to look very similar to this only kind of rotated a little bit uh starting from zero you're increasing and you're concave down that's this way increasing concave down now because again you have this vertical ASM toote the only way you can be increasing and concave down and have this veral ASM toote is by shooting up just like this you can't come down that would be decreasing so you're coming up like that coming up just like that now we reached this point that is our relative maximum it says at your relative Max you switch from increasing to decreasing but you're still concave down for that whole interval so increasing to decreasing but concave down that's that little point right there after that point it says you're decreasing for the rest of your graph you're decreasing the whole way but now you're concave up the only way we can decrease the rest of the way and be concave up and Associate this horizontal ASM toote is by putting it right along the x-axis just riding that thing all the way out and that's the same picture that you have on your graph that's an inflection point now how in the world does this graph look that's why I have the table this is pretty interesting because we're going to associate all the stuff with our ASM tootes now check it out you know that this has to go close to this one this has to go close to this one has to go here somewhere and there somewhere right now here's what it says it says you're going to be decreasing decreasing is like this and you're going to be concave down that's this way does that make sense all the way until you get to this point that TK 6 that looks like this decrease concave down do you follow me that's the only way you can have it if you're decreasing concave down up here you fail the ASM toote you have to be with the as that's why ASM tootes are important it says you're going to be at that ASM toote right there you see what I'm talking about okay from here to here this little little interval says you're decreasing but you're concave up so this part decreasing down this little part decreasing up that's the inflection Point coming back at us that's this that's concave up you see the the decreasing concave up then this part says increasing concave up that's this way and you actually do that all the way to zero now how do we go all the way to zero where do you think this is going if it's increasing and there's an ASM toote does it magically go back down here otherwise we have another relative Max wouldn't we it's going to go all the way to Infinity there's an asmt folks an ASM toote it has to go to the ASM toote so if it says increasing concave up to zero it's going like this for is there any other way that it could be and still have the ASM toote nope now the rest of it the other side of the graph the side of the graph says for this interval up to rooot three you're increasing you're concave down that's this way you follow increasing but you also have an ASM toote so you have to meet the ASM toote increasing concave down that's increasing concave down until you reach a relative Max you know that's a relative Max then it says for this little interval you're decreasing you're decreasing and your concave down decreasing and concave down that's this way so for here you're going to go up oh down and then from here on out after that Root 6 remember that's our Root 6 you're going to be decreasing put your concave up that's this way and you have to meet that ASM toote that's there as good as we can do but that's a pretty darn good graph for just having some for no graphing calculator that's pretty good how many people were able to follow that now you got to be careful be careful with these numbers you messed me up but that's okay be careful on your numbers on your own now we only got through one example if you want to hang out just a little bit I'm going to try to do one more all right we're going to do one more example how to graph some rational functions I'm going to try to go all the way through it but I'm going to be erasing things as we go so it might help you to write this down as we're going through it that way when I race it you're not like totally lost so I'm going to save some space I only have a limited board to work with so let's start with our x and y intercepts that's always step Number One X intercept says where is the numerator equal to zero that's the only places where this function can actually equal zero if the denominator equals zero then we're undefined we have either holes or ASM tootes so in our case X intercepts are add 8 IDE 2 take a sare root plus and minus 2 that a little bit lower okay y intercepts you plug in xal 0 what you have is 0 - 8 0 - 168 over6 is positive2 vertical asmp tootes those occur where your denominator equals zero and you can't cross it out you can't simplify if you were able to simplify it would be a whole but if you're not able to simplify that's a vertical ASM toote so when we have this denominator equal to zero again well it's different squares you can Factor it you can add 16 take a square root either way you're going to get x = 4 and -4 now x + 4 and x - 4 they do not simplify with our numerator that means they're not holes they are in fact ASM tootes all right now as far as our horizontal asmt go that says what happens when we take X to infinity and negative infinity and that's that's deal with a limit if you notice that we have our leading terms polinomial here polinomial here the powers are the same so when you do that whole divide by the largest power in the denominator thing you're going to divide by X2 what that's going to give you is 2 0 1 0 so basically you have two over one that's going to be two also notice that it doesn't matter if I have negative Infinity either you'd get the same exact thing what that means is we have a horizontal ASM toote at 2 to the right and two to the left so I'm going to erase this now we know our horizontal ASM tootes are at two either way Y = 2 now as far as our our first derivative test second der test here goes our derivatives try to follow along again I'm going to erase this when I'm done m that's our first derivative now what the first it says is slope where slope is positive you're increasing where slope is negative you're decreasing where slope is zero you have the potential for a relative Max relative men or something interesting could change maybe around an ASM toote or something change from increasing to decreasing we've seen that before so the ideas are find all the places where the numerator and the denominator equal zero so in our case the numerator equals 0 when X is or when - 48x is equal to Z that says xal 0 that's going to be one critical number that possibly is a relative Max relative men now where the slope is undefined it's not necessarily a critical point but it could change from whether whether the graph is increasing to decreasing or vice versa so in our case here hopefully you can see this denominator equals z when X is 4 and -4 that's it's not coincidental that that's our vertical ASM tootes those points can come up again especially with the quotient rule when you notice you're just squaring the denominator so three critical values that we're going to be putting on our first derivative table we've got our zero our four and our -4 take a look at this hopefully you've written this down I'm going to erase this right now and write it right up here that way I can work on my second derivative and what we got out of that again was 0 44 okay second derivative test was going to give you concavity so let's take the second derivative see what we get again write this down erase it when I'm done is this is going to be the fourth power since we're squaring that square notice the plus I'll change it right now just make a negative negative into a plus also I'm gonna take a shortcut here I know I tell you not to do this but we're going to take a general power rule times the derivative of the inside and that should be our derivative now we're going to do a little fancy math here we're going to simplify a couple pieces but I'm going leave a couple pieces alone because I want to factor it I want you to see the factorization so hopefully you seen what I've done um I've multiplied the 2x * 2 and this x to make it 4x^2 I've leaving the 48 alone because I want you to see that factor ation it just makes things a little bit easier for us so I'll be factoring out my 48 from right here also I'll be factoring out x^2 - 16 from here and one of them from right here so what that's going to leave us with be careful on your signs check this out factor out your 48 factor out one of your x^2 - 16 what you're left with is negative x^2 - 16 negative and one of those is remaining plus the 48 is gone we have 4x^2 the x^2 - 16 is gone check it with distribution if you really want to but if you distribute this in that's -48 x^2 - 16 2 plus 48 * 4x^2 and then x^2 - 16 so that's the correct factorization almost done one last little step what we're going to do is simplify this a little bit if you look at that that's x^2 + 16 + 4x^2 that's 3x^2 + 16 also we're going to simplify out 1 factor of x^2 - 16 So Gone Part of that's gone that's our second derivative that's about as good as we can make it now what the second derivative is again it's concavity it's how your slope is changing or in other words the curvature of your line of of your of your graph if you will so whether it's increasing or decreasing we can have two different types of that we can have increasing concave up increasing concave down we can have decreasing concave up we can have decreasing concave down just like that so what this says is to find those points where you change where you possibly could change concavity set your numerator equal to zero and your denominator equal to zero the numerator gives you the possible inflection points like the actual numbers the values where you can plug them into actual function and get a point the denominator says where the second der is undefined well it could still change concavity at those places but you probably won't find a point because it's most likely an ASM toote so here if you try this well notice that 3x^2 + 16 is that ever going to be is that ever going to work for you 3x^2 + 16 = 0 well 3x^2 = -16 x^2 = -16 over 3 can you have X2 equals negative the answer is no not in the real number system so here that's not going to give us any possible inflection point so that the numerator pretty much doesn't give us anything the denominator you're going to see again those same points keep popping up even from the beginning of our our function we had four and4 is being undefined that happens here as well so again we're going to have the points four4 okay again take a close look that's our second derivative all worked out for you nice and pretty set equal to zero numerator nothing denominator same points we've gotten before I'm going to erase it and then we're going to talk about step number five we'll we'll plug all this stuff in we'll make a nice table we'll have some points from our original function in uh step number six and then I'll graph it for and what this gave us was 4 and4 again now when we make the table hopefully you remember this from classroom from previous videos if you're watching this on video we put our first derivative up top second der on the bottom it basically gives us a a kind of a a concise version of our graph of our function on a graph so we're going to put all of these points on the top got to be in order and these points on the bottom and what we do is we test specific points in each interval and what that's going to tell us is where our graph is increasing or decreasing for the top that's our first derivative or concavity for our second derivative so I would test the points like5 1 1 and 5 and we're testing them in the respective derivatives so here we'll be using the first derivative on the bottom we're taking second derivative so concavity and we'll test some similar points but make sure you putting them in the second derivative not the first not the original original function gives you points on a graph first derivative gives you increasing or decreasing second derivative gives you concavity so let's try this if you want to try it at home plug in your own points but we're going to try frime of5 that's a negative time a negative this is our first derivative again remember first derivative negative * a negative is a positive that's a positive because it's squared that means that this is positive you don't exactly care about the whole value of it you care whether it's positive or negative increasing 1 well that says * negative is a positive over a positive again that is positive increasing next up we have one negative * a positive is a negative over a positive that's going to be a negative decreasing five negative * a positive is a negative over a positive it's still a negative decreasing second der is tell us some more things it'll say plug in5 but now do it to the second derivative second derivative is right here this is well let's see -5^ s well it's going to be positive plus positive positive oh that's positive oh you know what I made a mistake I think I drew that wrong if you were watching at home you might you might have notic what's Mr L thinking uh that should be a power three I was kind of thinking through that thinking wait a second that uh that doesn't make too much sense so let me change it to positive three and then we're going to we're going to check this point again I think that one's going to work out for us but make sure you have a three right there because that would be a big mistake I I forgot to I erased it before I copied it down so bad mistake on my part uh let's check it one more time let's check the5 so5 squ that's well that's positive * 3 is positive plus 16 still positive * 48 that's positive now let's check it down here we have -5^ 2 that's 25 - 16 well that's still positive and when you Cube it it'll still be positive so we're okay on the concave up it's still going to be concave up this is the one that's going to be changing for us if we plug in zero Zer well that's 16 times a positive number so positive but look what happens down here 0 squ is 0 - 16 well that's a negative what happens when you cube a negative well it's still a negative so this is going to be concave down and it's concave down for its entirety notice how we didn't get that zero in our second derivative so it's not going to be a place where we're changing concavity five same thing's going to happen as neg five we're going to have a positive up here we're going to have a positive down there that's concave up well that takes care of Step number five for us so so far we've found our X intercepts our y intercepts we've gone ahead done our first derivative and our second derivative we made up our table we have all of our intervals of increasing we have decreasing we've got concavity up there we're almost done what we need to do right now is find out some points what our points are plot them on our graph and look at how this is going to be graphed for us so points well our points are already on the board we have our X intercepts we have our y intercepts and we have our ASM tootes you're going to notice that all those points come back again at us we have zero well if we plug in zero you get 1/2 that that was our Y intercept so all of our points are basically listed we've got 2 0 -2 0 those are X intercepts we've got 0 one2 keep in mind what that is though that's our Y intercept and it's also if you look at it it's also this which is increasing to decreasing increasing to decreasing that's a relative Max relative Max is there a relative men no this says increas and increasing decreasing decre there's no way we're having a relative Min here doesn't happen also in in lection points we could try for inflection points we could try for some of these points but you'll see what when you plug them in plug them into your original function You've Got 4^ 2 - 16 you got -4 2 - 16 that's undefined that's how we got those ASM tootes in the first place so these things are all ASM tootes what it means is we only have three points to graph now I told you in class or on the video video that a lot of times you can actually graph these graphs just by looking at the asmp tootes and increasing decreasing I'm going to try to show you that right here so you can kind of visualize what what it's going to be even without the second derivative sometimes so if that's what you're looking for this is the part that you that you want so number one do your ASM tootes ASM tootes are vertical 44 hopefully you're okay with our ASM tootes horizontal says two in each Direction now keep in mind horizontal ASM tootes only work as you're going to Infinities so could you cross it here you could it doesn't mean it's like a a wall for you well that's a it's a wall for the Y yeah for our for I'm sorry for our vertical but horizontal not necessarily so horizontal says two in both directions but it only starts out here the next thing you do after you take care of your asmt and your graph you're going to plot all of your intercepts so our intercept says 2 comma 0 -2 comma 0 and 0 one2 we're going to label what they are too I've showed you that when you label these points well they're intercepts those don't do much for us besides say you cross the x- axxis here but that said you have to be a relative Max that's what that said we listed it as now just think about it even if you don't have the second derivative so let's just pretend I didn't even do the second derivative what's the only way we could fit this information on this graph with just the first derivative so hint hint on that test if you're if you're looking at how do I do the graph with just the first derivative sometimes you can do it this is one of those cases sometimes you can't you need the second derivative but a lot of times if you have ASM tootes and you have increasing decreasing you can picture what this graph looks like here's what I'm expecting from you if you know that your ASM toote goes this way and this way there's only two scenarios you're either going and you don't have any relative Maxum in notice you don't have any of those in this interval you don't have any of those in this interval you do have one in this interval but other than that there's no change in increasing there's no change in decreasing so unlike the previous example we can't do things like this otherwise we'd have relative Max we can't do things like this otherwise we have a relative Min it's either going to be up or down that's it it's the only thing we can have so when you look at it if there's no relative Maxes or mins there's no change in increase and decrease look at the first two intervals it says you are increasing all the way to zero you're increasing all the way so from actually to4 that's where we really looking from infity to4 you're increasing can this be increasing no no that that would be decreasing increasing says this way so to fit this on a graph if you have a horizontal ASM toote and a vertical ASM toote that's the only way it can be that's it now what about what about this section this section says you're increasing from -4 to 0 you're increasing from -4 to 0 and then you're decreasing from 0 to 4 well what's the only way that you can increase and then decrease and have one relative maximum and touch these two points the only way could possibly look is going up and coming down that's it I'll talk about concavity in a minute just want you to see the idea of fitting your graph to ASM tootes first now after positive4 it says you're decreasing decreasing mind you like this no that would be increasing like this yes that is decreasing there's no relative Max no relative men that means you're decreasing throughout means you have to go from left to right downward the only way you're going to fit this ASM toote and this ASM toote is with a picture like that now I have gone ahead and done the second derivative for you and I gave you the the table as well if you want to go that far that's fine in fact most times you really should should I'm just trying to get you to think outside the box here but if you if you compare the concavity with this let's see if it works it says you're increasing and your concave up all the way from negative Infinity to4 increasing and concave up looks like this Ah that's what we have increasing concave up then on this interval from4 to 0 that's here says you're increasing but you're concave down well look at that if you have these ASM tootes increasing concave down that's exactly what we did and we fit it to our points -2 0 and 0 1/2 we had to do that from 0 to 4 you're decreasing and you're concave down decreasing concave down looks like this so from here we're decreasing 0 to 4 and concave down hey that works last section from four onwards we're decreasing and we're concave up decreasing concave up looks like that decreasing concave we got it that's our graph do all seven steps you have your picture but sometimes with these rational function if you if you have those ASM tootes handy you can sometimes take your first derivative and just look at that graph and put it in the right places and the concavity does work out for you 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 3.7:  Optimization; Max/Min Application Problems
we are going to tackle how to maximize and or well and or minimize some functions specifically some continuous functions so basically if we're maximizing or minimizing continuous functions we have really two scenarios we're going to talk about them over closed intervals closed intervals closed finite intervals or open Infinite intervals so basically it has this if I give you continuous function will it have an absolute maximum will it have an absolute minimum and how can you apply that to real life we're talking about cost if you're a business you probably want to find out the lowest cost right or you want to find out the maximum profit that's probably what you want to do right you would want to find the maximum cost and the minimum profit that would suck because then you're going to waste a lot of money and you're going to get fired probably uh or if you just guess you're not going to be making as much money you're be spending too much money if you just guess at things I think if we produce this amount then it's going to be good let's try well why don't you do the calculus and figure out exactly what you need to produce exactly how much is going to cost and minimize the cost maximize the profit and that's that's pretty much the idea does that make sense if you're making stuff you want and you're trying to like boxes are you going to make a a storage box that's this long and this wide and and that that deep would that be a good storage box not if you want to maximize the volume right with the same amount of surface space so if I say here's a here's a th000 square ft of cardboard makebe the best box you can we should be able to do that we should be able figure out the dimensions using some calculus and that's what we're talking about maximization problems well I'm going to relate this back to absolute Max and absolute men here's the idea if you have a closed interval closed interval looks like this with brackets if you have a closed interval with brackets do you for certain have an absolute Max absolutely do you have an absolute men so for a close interval because these have brackets you will certainly have Solutions there will be Solutions if it's a continuous function and there's a closed interval always how about open open intervals because remember absolute Max and absolute Min if you think back if you watch the video from a while back uh absolute Maxima and Minima must occur at one of two places must occur at relative Max or men for continuous functions relative Max or men or at end points do you remember talking about that if I take away the fact that it has end points well then it must occur at relative Maxes or mins which don't have to be could be but don't have to be the absolute Maxim in so while a Clos interval will definitely have an absolute Maxim in or will definitely have maximum and a minimum because we have end points this one might not have them because there's no end points are are you with me on this so might not have Solutions well we're going to jump right into it with an example we'll start off quite simply I I want to basically do some example to give you uh some vocabulary and how to how to do the problem let's say that I want you to build a region that's fenced in so basic a rectangular region so basically Wyoming or something I think it's pretty much a rectangle right well if you consider the Earth to be flat it would be a rectangle it's curv never mind it's a surface space but let's pretend the world's flat for Wyoming cuz have you been to Wyoming it pretty much is um not really they have mountains and stuff but let's just pretend it's flat and it's a rectangle I want you to fence it we're going to make this easier than that but basically you're fencing a rectangular region yeah have fence a rectangular region and maximize the area you have 100 ft of fencing available of course this is not Wyoming anymore okay but because Wyoming is very large we're just going to fence some regular area okay you have 100 ft of fence this by the way is called something specific for these applied problems it's called a constraint it says this is what you have to work with it's putting a limit on your area basically because if I said maximize the area you just go okay I'm going to make it as long as I can times as wide as I can that's maximizing but as soon as I say oh you only have 100t of fencing well that changes things doesn't it you have to have that statement that's called a constraint constraints can be given to you they can be implied in the problem they can be realistic constraints but somewhere in your in most of these problems you will have some sort of a constraint now one great thing to do with these applied problems they're all going to have something you can draw so try to draw a picture of them to get your mind wrapped around it we're talking about a rectangle here so we're probably going to want to draw a rectangle here so let's draw a rectangle here doesn't matter what you call the sides but call them something call this one maybe X and this one y bless you thank with me still what's this side good and this one's why because inherently we know about rectangles opposing sides are of equal value so we have that the next thing you do you come up with some sort of area that has to deal with what you're trying to maximize or minimize something you're trying to find the maximum or minimum of very much like with Rel related rates right you're trying to find an area that Inc incorporates everything here you're trying to find a formula uh sorry formula that incorporates everything here you're trying to find a formula that incorporates what you're trying to maximize with your figure so we want our formula and you need to list out any constraints that you have okay tell me something we've already drawn our picture let's come with a formula that has to do with with what we're trying to maximize what are we trying to maximize here ladies and gentlemen okay so if we're trying to maximize area you need to be able to come with the formula for the area what's the formula for area specifically for this what's the formula for our area X Y would give us the area of that rectangle true x * y now let's talk about our constraint what does the 100 ft of fence have to do with anything that has to be your what's that called the domain of the function oh kind of kind of kind of sort of perimeter perimeter we'll talk about domain in a minute okay but the 100 ft of fencing you know that goes around your figure right so that is your perimeter so right here our formula we're trying to maximize is the area you with me on that that's what it the question says but a formula that's inherent in our problem has to do with our constraint and it says well I know that if I add up all the sides it has to equal how much now add up all the sides how much do you get good if I add that up I add this one this one this one this one that's 2 X's plus 2 y's and you get another formula out of your constraint raise your hand feel okay with this so far okay very good now the question is what are we trying here's where you answer your question if you have two more than one formula what are you trying to do here are you trying to maximize your constraint or maximize your area your area so what you're going to do use your constraint solve for one variable and substitute it in to the formula that you're trying to maximize or minimize the reason is can you find a derivative of x and Y yeah you can with implicit however you're going to need to solve for y anyway to be able to do anything with it so solve this for y and substitute it in so we're going to solve our constraint for one variable I would choose y I don't know I like y so solve for y and then substitute that into your formula so you're going to solve the constraint for one variable and sub into your formula okay you get to choose which one you want to solve it for I'm going to choose to solve for y so I'm going to subtract 2x I'm going to divide by two and I'm going to get 50x or 50 yeah okay so from here yeah if I divide everything by two I'm going to get y = 50 - x so far so good what the does it says okay now that I have y = 50 - x let's take that let's put it here that changes our formula from two different variables into one variable and that says I can do something with Calculus with it all right you need that one variable for us so I'm going to get a = x and instead of Y I need I need parentheses do you see why I need parenthesis you sure hate us right now hate no Hate's a strong word but you need parentheses they're important if you give me this you know I'm going to have a cow right literally half I I used to live on a dairy I could half a cow if I wanted there's 6,000 of them you 6,000 cows there's only 45 of you 45 cows for each person a lot of cows so far so good make it easier before you do the next thing we're going to do you see right now we have this formula for area right what we're trying to do is maximize the area which is why we're working with the formula for area now what we learned here was that this really is a closed interval there's only so far I can make my X I can't make my X or my y like 3,000 ft right because I only have 100 to work with so I I'm actually dealing with some some domain restraints right there we'll talk about that a second but we know that wherever a maximum or a minimum occurs it's going to be at either an npoint which we'll talk about in a bit or it's going to be at a relative extreme point a relative Max like this how do you find relative Maxes what do you do with functions that's a function what do you do with functions to find relative Max you take a derivative because you know relative Maxes happen where the slope is zero right to find the slope you take a derivative so with your applied problems let's take a derivative of that now I wouldn't be so silly as to do a product rule here I'd probably distribute and get 50x - x^2 and then take a derivative but we're going to take a derivative because what a derivative is is our what's a derivative again slope and we want to know where the slope equals z because where the slope equals z gives us a critical point and that could potentially be our relative Max or men if it's a relative Max that means it could be our absolute max if it's not it will certainly occur at an end point but it's something we need to check so take our first derivative that would be U with respect to X in this case notice that if you had solved for X here and plugged in and had y's you'd have d a Dy you follow me on that show your notation appropriately this is with respect to the variable that you have X in our case you get 50 - 2x are you okay so far what's that give you again SL slope and what do we want to find with the slope where it equals z if it equals zero somewhere that's going to be possibly a change from increasing to decreasing might be decreasing increasing but it will give us the only point on our interval where that that change could possibly occur that's why we're going to check this with the end points later to determine whether it's a actual Max whether it's a minimum how much is X probably add 2x divide two probably 25 hopefully 25 25 I got the 25 I we will feel okay getting xal 25 now if x is 25 how much is y use your constraint to solve for that just plug in the 25 y's got to be 25 so if x is 25 we use this again but then you're going to have to check see here's what we did what we did is we found out that the only possible place where we have an absolute maximum other than the end points is right there would you agree with that that's the only place that we change from increasing decreasing or decreasing increasing that's the only relative even possible relative extreme that we have and what we know for before is that absolute Max which is what we're trying to do Max or Min absolute Max must occur at end points or at relative extrema our end points are well we'll talk about that we're going to check right here but our possible relative extrema is at X 25 although there are excuse me there are some end points here can you tell me what's the biggest thing we could make x wait 100 if you did 100 you'd have a one-sided fence not 99 75 oh no too big still 50 50 x could be 50 you have two x's right that's right so if x is one thing it has to be the other thing on other side if you do 75 you can't do 75 25 that doesn't make sense it's not a rectangle now you might be thinking well is 50 and 50 a rectangle technically yes kind of if you have 50 and 50 how much is y going to be that's going to be a rectangle is that going to maximize your area actually has zero area cuz it's 50 * 0 right that would be Z it'd be a line you get two just a fence next to a fence but you could do it right so the maximum that X could be like you were the stupid you may be a it's for skinny cows skinny cows coming from California okay so x x is 50 equals the maximum value you can make X because 50 + 50 equal 100 what's the least value you could make X zero CU then y would be 50 and 50 right that'd be a straight line other direction again your area would not be good but here's the point okay this is kind of a simplistic example but it says this it says if a maximum is going to occur it occurs here here or here it has to occur because this is a closed interval it's going to be here here or here so X is bound between here's our end points this says X is somewhere in the interval that's what that little element says somewhere in the interval of 0 to 50 inclusively including zero including 50 that's somewhere where X is if we have this interval which is our our inherent constraint in our problem then our absolute Max must be one of these three numbers we know it's either end points or or it's at a a relative extreme and that's the only place we could possibly have a relative extreme now have you feel okay with that so far all right so you're going to plug him in where are you going to plug those in first derivative is going to give you zero because that's where how you found that number it not the first derivative what gives you values people the original function in our case that's our original function or if you have the Y you can plug it in there that's okay but plug here and that's going to maybe be a little bit easier to do I would say for just X's if you plug in 50 check it out look it what's 50 - 50 your area is zero we talked about that that's straight line this way right plug in zero 50 - 0 is 50 times gives you that's the Y equals 50 and 50 that would give that's minimizing your area right there 0o and zero this one hopefully is maximized hopefully it gives us something plug in 25 this said the area is zero this said the area is zero this is the area is we knew it had to be one of those three this is the biggest one Argo it must be your absolute maximum so what do we say the absolute maximum is 625 Square ft when X = 25 basically what shape do you have sare you have a square yeah you have a square 25 25 25 25 cuz X and Y are both 25 so how you'd write it out um I really don't want to race any this but I'll write down here the maximum area is 625 Square ft be specific when x = 25 and Y = 25 feet do you feel okay with our example yes no we're going to go a little bit quicker now we're going to because we we understand the idea formula constraint put them together that's basically the idea let's talk about one that we we actually had before if you want to go back and refresh on the video I had this problem excuse me this problem but we didn't do anything with it do you remember the problem where I said I want you to take a piece of cardboard I want you to cut sections out of it I want you to make a box oh it came up better this time lot better do you see the Box yep that did my job if I make this or would I say 16 and 30 don't really matter let's do 16 and 30 this is 16 in this is 30 in and each of these Cuts is X so the problem from a long time ago was let's suppose I had this this box this piece of cardboard and I cut X's squares of X Out of each corner I could fold up the sides and it would make a box like that right an open box like that do you remember that problem do you recall if this is this side and it's not the scale of course but if this is this side what's the length of that is it still 30 30 - x is close but it's not 30 - x 30 - 2x yes cuz you have an X from each side you okay with that F how much is that size it's still 16 very good okay how much is the height of our box whatever the size of the corner is you cut out that's going to give you the height do you follow you're taking this this square right you're cutting out a square you're going to fold up this side fold up this side it's going to give you that box it's going to be a height of X show hands tell me feel okay with our picture now what we want to do in this problem I want us to find out the maximum the maximum volume that we can make this box so let's say you're working for UPS right say we got we get so much of this stuff we have so many pieces of cardboard left over there're 16x 30 I want you to take a stamping machine cut out X's fold them up takee the sides how many boxes can we make or sorry what what's the biggest size of a box we can make out of this and you go well I don't want to just waste product let me do the problem real quick so let's figure this out so we want to maximize the volume well I told you there's really two things we do after we draw a picture number one we draw a picture number two we got to find a formula we got to find any constraints that we have so let's work on a formula can you find a formula for volume because that's what we're trying to maximize say it again so basically all three dimensions times each other right in our case can you tell me more specifically what that will be for us that's important yeah you should have that and then what else I'll put the X out front is that okay with you so don't forget about it one dimension length time width time height was going to give you the volume you feel okay with the volume now let's look at a constraint it told you nothing else about this problem it just said I have this make me a box I told you nothing else however inherently in this problem there is a constraint in fact we talked about it the first time we had this if you watch the video you can see it There's a constraint here what's the constraint wait wait why not 16 why doesn't why can't X be smaller than 16 why is it eight because you have to take it from both side very good if you didn't hear she said you have to take it from both sides right so if I make an X cut here I have to be able to make the same X cut here right if I go more than eight I overlapped I don't have any more stuff to cut off so eight is the maximum cut I could make would it be a good idea to cut off eight if I cut eight and eight and eight and eight that's going to be the worst box ever it's going to be a really small piece of cardboard and you go and you're going to go dude seriously you're fired all right that would be silly you don't want to do that so you could do eight you could but you know it has to be less than that or equal to eight what's the smallest cut you could make what if you didn't make one you'd have the second worst box ever right the first worst box is you cut something off and fail to make a box that's the eight and eight you cut off eight you cut off eight that's gone cut off eight you cut off eight that's gone you basically have a 14 in by uh whatever that is 16 14 by 16 flat piece of cardboard if you don't make a cut at least you have a 16x 30 flat piece of C cardboard but it's still not going to hold anything but you could check it understand that that is my inherent constraint do you see it okay we have a formula it's a in terms of one variable that's great if we had two variables we would need another another constraint to work with it we have a constraint that's going to limit our our end results that we're going to check our end points there what do you do now you're trying to maximize right you know Maxima and Minima have to occur here here or somewhere in the somewhere in there right it's got to be in there but the places where it occur are the places where the slope is going to be zero right how do you find the slope take a derivative when all this fails take a derivative you going to take a derivative of this product rule no you're not going to do that why don't you distribute it out see what you get take a derivative set it equal to zero so that's volume I don't know if I did that right did I do that right I mess it up I did right oh sweet seriously good cuz I was guessing totally guessing no I'm just kidding I knew it um anyway so you distribute it you combine everything together hopefully you got that far did you get that far now take your first derivative make sure I'm right by the way I like being right that's awesome sorry that's V of X so V Prime of x is that yes no okay that's nasty what do you do with that set equals zero and prey you can factor out 12 right set equals Zer because that's going to give you the only places where you have a critical point critical point is the only places you have a relative Max relative Min so set this thing equal to zero there 12 factor out of it what do you do try six try six did six factor out of it you can do four do you do four you can't do six darn it hate that you can do four so four factors out of it you can still factor out the four though right if you don't want to do quadratic formula that suck how much is that divided by four 46 120 well you try to factor it or use quadratic formula do you remember the quadratic formula yeah xal oh we should watch mat C video I sing We Sing About It X bad 4 a 2 a did it nice brings back so many memories schol yeah first time I've ever heard that song really okay are you working it out have you already worked it out I have no idea those too big for me to do my head I don't know I don't know what it is I'm going to uh6 Total oh no I just I don't need this 21 2116 total no no 676 676 7 Dam it 676 six that's easy 6 what's the sare root of 676 26 126 26 26 126 very good 23 okay let's see you get what 23 plus orus 133 23 orus 13 everything by 72 over 6 and 20 over 6 12 and 10/3 is what you're telling me yes no feel okay with 12 and 10/3 took way too long OMG BFF TGI Fridays um tell me something about these these points it be 12 why can't it be 12 we can't make it X bigger as 12 so this one even though it says 12 you cannot do that the only one it could possibly be is 10/3 so let's think about this now realistically we already said and you could check it you check your end points in fact I'll I'll eras this I'll do it over here your end points are zero eight and only critical number you had was 10/3 if you make zero as your X cut you're going to get a volume of zero if you make eight as your X cut you're going to get a volume of zero are you with me still so far look at your volume function it says if you make let's see make a cut of 0 0 * anything is z you make a cut of 8 16 - 8 * 2 is is z that's time Z so you're going to get volume of zero the only one that can possibly work is 10/3 so what you would do I'm not going to spend the time to do this but you find out whatever has anyone done that the volume for that 10/3 if you do what you do is you plug in your 10/3 you find your volume whatever this is is your maximum so the maximum volume would be plug in 10/3 to your original volume function figure out what it is I'm not going to have you do that right now do it on your own time figure out what that volume is and that will be your maximum volume it occurs at a cut of 3 and A3 in you follow me on that 3 and A3 inches how we feel okay with our maximization so far you were try something a little bit more fun cuz when are you ever going to do this in real life maybe yeah I'm not a box cutter but I do build oil pipelines in the middle of the ocean so let's do an example like that okay okay wait really no wish that's a summer job seriously though any questions let before I erase it do you understand the idea you understand how to draw a picture come with a formula that relates that picture to what you're trying to maximize or minimize do your derivative it's all about the derivative set it equal to zero solve it come up with your constraint and check your end points that's absolute Maxim in that's exactly what we've done before in what 3 point I don't know what it was we've already done that you said you plug in your end points you plug in any critical numbers you had whichever biggest One Max smallest one Min no problem that's the idea 726 how much 726 726 anybody else get the same answer uh I did 726 this should be in cubic in you guys ever go to Santa Barbara she has oil pipelines out there sometimes they have pipe let's say you want to build one of those but you wanted to not have tankers go back and forth so what you're going to do is build that thing and then build an under thewater pipeline to land because you have a refinery right off the coast somewhere so here's what happened your refineries here at point B the oil you located is there oil if you were to go directly from the oil to shore we'll call that point a here's the idea here's what you know about the the situation pipe costs a whole much whole bunch more to put it in the Ocean than it does on land you got to have people go out there lay it right go under the water put the pipe together do all that stuff okay now we're going to make this kind of simplified it probably doesn't cost a dollar per kilometer but we're going to say it cost a dollar maybe it's like a a million dollars per kilometer or a billion I don't know how much it is but let's say that it costs twice as much for the underwater stuff as it does for the on land stuff you with me on that so the pipe costs $1 per kilm in the ocean and half of that on the lens so whatever it is you could substitute in different numbers and you get this right same exact idea okay on there if we want to minimize the [Applause] cost which I hope that you do right you want to build the worst pipeline for if you want to build the worst pipeline you go like this uh let's put the oil way over here and then down here and then over here that'd be stupid right we want to come with the most cost effective way to do this pipeline so if we want to minimize our cost what would you do would you go like this would you make your oil pipeline here and there would would you do that no I don't know it seems to me like that would be the least amount of ocean pipeline but the most possible land pipeline wouldn't it I don't know if it's going to be cost effective I have no idea uh I really don't know would you go straight from the oil to the oil stop you could that would be the the the fastest way right the least amount of pipe in general but this is the most expensive pipe you can lay right this would be less expensive so chance are we're going to come with some point that's intermediate that says well how can we do this maybe we take our oil and we pipe it to some onshore point and then lay the pipe from here to here does that make sense the way if you label it Point p and you say Well Point P very well could end up being at a right it might it could be here could be at point B it'll come up in the formula it' be at your end points all right so let's say if we want to minimize our cost how far should Point P be from point A oh my gosh I don't know no idea let's let's try think through this thing oh there's one more thing I need you to know doing your measurements that's 8 km okay so you know that and you know that your oil is 5 km off the shore those are things you know what we want to know is where's that point gun to be to make this the cheapest so we're going to basically make a in the in the ocean pipeline combined with the on the land pipeline see how far this is what what do I what am I asking here how far this has to be from there what do you want to call that the distance from here to here I call it some variable whatever it is just call it X now let's think critically about this if this area I'm sorry this uh this distance is X from a to P how far is the distance from P to B don't use y because then we have to come up with another formula to solve it try to base it on X that's the reason I gave you the eight x - 8 or 8 - x 8 if this distance is 8 if that was a two that would be a six right if that was a four that would be a four you're taking 8 minus that X so whatever that is do you feel okay with our picture so far do you understand the question the question is let's try to minimize our cost if we have to get oil from there to point B if we know that this is 8 km we know that it's 5 kmet off the shore let's find the best place to do that so that we don't spend a whole heck of a lot more money than we need to well here's the deal we need to come up with some formula that relates the cost of this to our problem so let's try to do that cost what do you need to know to find the cost of something let's see well we need know how far this pipe is don't we okay I'll give you the easy one how far is it from P to B would you agree that 8 - x in parenthesis uh would you agree that that is the amount of on land pipeline we're going to need do we need pipe from a to p no we're going to go from the ocean to P we need pipe from P to B you follow me on that that's the 8 - x 8- X how much is each and that's in kilm 8 kmus x km how much is each kilm of pipe on land dollar no it's not a dollar it's a half of a dollar so would you agree that if this is the amount of pipe one half of that remember this is dollars half a dollar times that amount is going to give us the amount of money it's going to cost to go from P to B how people feel okay with that so far okay very oh let's let's do that let's do oil to PE let's do this distance how do we do that distance that's a right right triangle that's why by the way we called that X right that's why so that we get a Pythagorean theorem triangle it's kind of nice you don't want to do with 8- X it's crazy so this is X that's five if this is X and that's five this is I'm GNA kind of do it a little real quickly for you this is the square root of x^2 + 5^ 2 do you follow me on that leg squ plus leg squ equal hypotenuse squ take the squ root of the hypotenuse and that's the distance from a to P I'm sorry from oil to P yes no leg squ plus leg squ squ so if our distance is I'll put it in Black so you see it the sare otk of x^2 + 25 which by the way you can't just take the square root of x s and the 25 right that's not just X+ 5 you can't do that it's s otk of x + 25 and you can't do anything with it would you agree that this is how far it is from the oil to point P okay so this is the distance from oil to point P this is the distance from point P to point B this is all the pipe that we're going to need right what's the cost of this pipe one do could you do it with different amounts of money of course you could the numbers get worse but this is the same idea how do I have the cost of this and the cost of that what do I need to put between them no not parentheses I need to add those costs let's try to think about the formula one time that we'll start working with this next time we're going to take our problem and break it down little by little we're trying to come up with a formula to minimize the thing that I'm asking you for here we had to minimize the cost so to find the cost out well you need to know how far your pipe is multiply that by the cost if this whole thing is 8 km and a to P is X then P to B is 8 - x that's the distance each of that those kilom cost half a dollar that's this portion of it to get from the oil to Point P which is probably some it's going to be some intermediary intermediary point we're going to find the distance using Pythagorean theorem that's the 5^2 plus X2 take a square root of it that's where we get that each of those kilom cost a dollar each if we have the cost for offshore plus the cost for onshore that's our total cost how many you feel okay with this so far all right we're going to continue working on a problem I'm going to kind of recap what we what we did last time just so you know so what we're doing is what're we're drilling for oil off of a of some Coast somewhere and we know where this oil is and we know where we want the oil to be and it's not directly out from the shore maybe this money this is too expensive to buy over here so we got to get the oil from here to our Oil Stop maybe this is our shipping yard or maybe it's our Refinery we want to pipe it directly to there you get the idea so we know one thing about it we know right now that it's 8 km from A to B we also knew that the oil happens to be 5 km off the shore and let me explain the idea once again what we're trying to do is we're trying to minimize the cost of our pipeline the pipeline costs a dollar at seed now of course it's going to be more than that real life but the principle stays the same and half a dollar on land so we had some options here we could have made the sea line as cheap as possible that would go directly to the shore right but then our land line would be as the longest possible maybe that's not going to minimize our cost we could have gone directly from the oil to our Oil Stop which says you don't do any land line but you have the most expensive sea line you can possibly have right so we're saying what if this is the case because we're not quite sure we don't know what's going to happen but most likely we'll have some sea line and we'll have some land line and that will probably minimize our cost so we asked the question how far does point B Point P have to be from point A in order to minimize our cost that's a l different problem well do we know how far Point P has to be from point A right now X so we're going to call it X we call it X because we don't know the distance and if you think about it we're going to have to figure out how far this is right that's going to be a Pythagorean theorem problem which I'm seeing in my head around I'm thinking you know what I don't want to deal with something very complicated here let's just make it an X so I'm going to pick X if that's X and we know the whole distance is 8 kilm then the distance from P to B is what it says this it says the distance from the the amount of pipe that we're going to have for our land is going to be 8 - x whatever X is we subtract that from 8 that's how much pipe we have to have in in the land you follow me on this but what we also need to know we've got to know the distance of pipe we're going to lay at C so from the oil to point P we got to know that I think I did this last time but I did it very quickly we've used the Pythagorean theorem it is a right triangle so it says leg squ plus leg squ equal the hypotenuse squar if that's true I'm going to erace my ocean here ocean if we do that then I know whatever this distance is is equal to X2 + 5 S it's a leg squ plus leg squ if I take a square root of it the reason why I take got to take a square root the hypotenuse squared equals that so to get the hypotenuse take a square root of both sides so our distance here is the square Ro TK of x^2 plus let's just change it to 25 you okay with this so far now before we work on the formula I don't think I did this last time let's talk about a constraint let's talk about a constraint on X what's the least amount of distance you could have for X remember X is the distance from a to P what's the the least amount you could have you probably would want negative right if you did negative you'd go this way would you want to go this way that'd be pretty stupid because you go let make our oil over here and then that'd be really silly right we want to probably go this way that way it's closer to our oil so zero is the least amount we could make X we could go directly from oil to shore right 90 gra directly right there that' be the shortest that that'd be probably the best uh way to go if that minimize our cost we're not going to go this way we go straight down so0 is the least we could have for X but it could be zero what's the greatest we could have for X yeah you're not going to do this you're go oh let's go way fast and come back that' be pretty stupid as well right you you maximize cost prob well maximize cost of your everywhere but you go way past and you come back that'd be silly so we could have eight you all agree that X has a minimum of zero and a maximum a well what that does for us that gives us some inherent constraints that gives us some end points what this says right here is that if we have end points which we do 0 and 8 and we find a critical number it one of those points is going to minimize our cost for us it's either going to be at 0 8 or somewhere in between there if if a critical number exists do you follow okay so at least we have our constraints down now let's talk about the formula here's how you come up with a formula for the cost I didn't start with this last time but I'd like to show this to you to find out your cost you really just have to identify the pieces of your puzzle the pieces of your picture in this case you right I to have some some pipe at C so the cost of the pipe at C plus the cost of the pipe on land well since we know how much it cost per kilometer let's just figure out the kilometers so the pipe on the land we just talked about this with the pipe on the land is from P to B that's our 8 - x so if we know that the distance of pipe is 8 - x and it costs a half a dollar per kilometer this is this is how many kilometers we're going to have of land pipe we're just going to take half of that and that's going to be the number of dollars we're going to spend for the pipe on the land you okay with this so far that's going to be added to the pipe at C now we just figured out how much pipe we have at C it's aunk x^2 + 25 that's how many kilometers of pipe we're going to have under the sea or or at the sea in the sea each of those kilometers cost a doll so if I multiply a dollar times each of those kilometers I'll have the total cost for the pipe at C and that's how you figure out the cost function in terms of X the distance that you're looking for orig if feel okay with that so far I think that's where we we actually left off last time now what do you want to do what do we want to do with this maybe before we take the derivative make it look a little bit better right probably distribute that half into that 8 - x because you don't want start doing with derivatives until it looks kind of pretty deal with that one up front that looks nasty so does not to do anything but it looks silly 1 * anything is anything so the < TK of x^2 + 25 plus this is going to give you 4 - x 2 or 12 x if you prefer still okaye so far now that's our cost function and that's what we're trying to minimize maybe do one more thing with that square root what would you change the square root into to the 1/2 not negative 1/2 right not -2 but you the 1/2 if that's the function we're trying to minimize here's what you know about Maxima and Minima absolute value or I'm sorry absolute maximum absolute minimum you know that they occur at end points or critical numbers we know that for a fact right it's only thing that happen with continuous functions and that's continuous on the interval so it's either going to be at end points or critical numbers we have our end points which we'll check in a while we don't have critical numbers how do you find critical numbers that's where the calculus comes in for maximizing things or minimizing things it says you find out where the critical numbers are those are the only places besides end points where you could possibly have an absolute Max or an absolute Min in our case do you follow me go ahead and take the first derivative there what type of rule do you need to apply to take the first derivative here General okay did you get that far what key piece of information have I left out so far the exponent exponent don't forget the exponent you're subtracting one right you're not subtracting 1/2 you're subtracting one so if I take 1/2 minus one I I need to be getting that negative one2 did you get that as well okay then derivative of the inside we know that because that is a general power rule how about the four zero how about this oh good okay so not another product rule anything crazy you just take the derivative of that little piece that's 12 now this is going to equal 12 x^2 + 25 to the -2 times derivative 2us 12 now I know I Get Crazy on You guys about parentheses I know I do should you have parentheses around this no no if this had all been in then yes you would have but you don't this is-2 at the very end you follow me on that in this case that says that this 1/2 and this two that is something that you can simplify out does that make sense I'll show you in two steps this will be 2x over 2 < TK x^2 + 25 true statement - 12 yes no and then the twos are gone so the first derivative of our cost function which we're trying to minimize in this case is X x^2 + 25- 12 that looks fairly nasty enough what are you supposed to do with that thing that's our first derivative what is the first derivative stand for slope okay what do we do with that can you explain why I know we talked about a lot can you explain why we have to set our first derivative equal to zero why do we do that your max going to be wherever the slope is zero very good so we know that maximum Absol what he said was absolute maximum absolute minimum have to be at one of a couple places first end points could happen but if they don't happen at end points they will happen where we change from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing in either case the slope will be zero at that point so if we set our slope equal to zero that will solve for the only points where we could possibly change from going up to going down or going down to going up does that make sense that's why we said equals zero so let's do that oh goodness uh what now cry give up go on spring break let's just leave no seriously what do you do no conjugate probably add one half why add one2 well you actually have something nice here kind of nice little bit nice not super nice a little bit nice do you see what you have here you have fraction equal to fraction right that's called a starts with a P runs with or proportion proportion proportion what do you do with proportions oh dear me yeah you press multiply that's fine that's great press multiply them go dot dot dot dot dot dot you're going to have 2X equal 1 time the < TK of 25 x^2 + 25 that looks a lot better why does it look a lot better you have a square root isolated get rid of a square root how do you do itare square both sides so let's Square both sides don't forget that when you square both sides you're not just squaring the X you're squaring the 2x do you follow me Square Square gone 4x^2 = x^2 + 25 nothing changes no distribution X the the square and the square root those are gone they're inverse oper they're inverse exponents in fact if you think about it it's actually 1/2 to the second power right you multiply exponents when they're being raised to each other that means 2 * 1 12 is 1 so it just disappears it's great what now solve for x so I would probably subtract the x s from both sides since there's not an X term this is nicer this is 3x2 equals 25 you with me there's no nasty factoring to be done nothing like that get rid of the three how do you get rid of the three when there's not an X term this is the way you deal with quadratic you just solve it for the X squ and take a square root of both sides if there was an X term you'd have to use quadratic formula or you'd have to factor it or complete the square but when there's no X term no just x to the first Power term this is nice divide 3 you get x2 = 25 over three get rid of the square sorry what does that again Square so Square both sides what do you need when you square root both sides yeah you you have to show that so you get the square < TK of 25 over 3 plus or minus of course that's going to be plus or minus 5 over < tk3 if you rationalize multiply by roo3 over root3 you know what rationalization is right you're going to get 53 over 3 tell me something about one of these numbers say again why why is the negative not an answer it's not in there it's not in there at all this is actually negative that would be this case that'd be going this way we don't want to go that way okay so we're not going to take the negative so our only critical Number 533 now do you automatically know that that's going to minimize our cost not really you do have to check it okay so what if we what if we did this derivative and that actually was not this it could very well be this couldn't it what if we did that we would have just maximized our cost now intuitively we probably think that this is going to be a minimum because we're we're kind of thinking this is really expensive this is the longest distance so it's probably somewhere in between there but you have to check I mean people have made some serious Mistakes by taking a derivative and not checking whether they had the minimum or the maximum with simple formulas like this you can think about it but Advanced formulas oh man you got to check the way you check is either with a second derivative right either that and that would test concavity for you and say oh okay take take that point in the second derivative uh if it's negative that's a maximum it's positive that's a minimum does that make sense because that will tell you concavity or you do the analysis that I showed you how to do you make your first derivative test you say increasing decreasing increasing and that's going to give you what type of Maximum you have or you check end points on these intervals so that's like three different ways you can check we know that all of our possible Max and mints have to occur here here or there that's it so if we plug in those three values one of them will give us a minimum so I'm going to go back over here we're going to check these points by the way when we're checking points like this are we using the first derivative are we using the original function where I'm checking abs like absolute Max and Min what am I checking the original one yeah because that's telling us actually the the cost the actual cost there so I'm looking here right there are we plugging in zero or we plugging in eight or one of them can you help me out with that Zer is nine so this is X a is 9.43 and this is our cost right so zero would give us a cost of $9 $9 now if this is a billion actually a billion instead of like one that's $9 billion I don't know how much it is how about eight what you say eight3 okay how about 53 over3 I don't know 53 3 is we have it written down how many you got 8.33 1 two 3 four yes yes and you all sure you're right I love it 8.33 did we find the minimum what is the minimum good okay the minimum the minimum isn't 53 over3 that's not what the minimum is the minimum cost is actually $833 the maximum cost would have been $943 right this nine but it's intermediate but it's definitely not the the minimum or the maximum so our minimum actually occurs when xal 533 how much is 5un over3 about 2 866 yeah so about 2.9 km so here's what this says if you're the one building this Pipeline and your boss says look I got to have you minimize the cost what you could do right that's kind of a realistic example if you had to actually do this you could do it with this right you easily do it all you need is the cost now that's not going to be a dollar but even if it was like $1.38 million per kilometer at se you can do it cost there you could do it you'd say okay boss whoever you are uh we're going to go from point A which is directly perpendicular to from the land to our oil you're going to go 2.9 km and that's where you're going to draw the line and you say you're going to make your oil line from there to there exactly from there to there make your land line from here to here have two people start working meet at the middle and that way you save the most money does that make sense we definitely don't just want to guess this right here if x is zero if x is zero you got n $9 doesn't seem like a whole lot of lot you're like oh that's only what 67 cents but if this is in billions that's $670 million if I did my math right it's a lot of money okay you you definitely don't want to have eight oh my gosh you did eight that's that's the worst the worst you could do is go directly from there to there that's the worst unless you couldn't buy all this land and then maybe you'd have to but that would be a different constraint how many people understand our example here today good we're going to do one more we're going to talk about um minimizing material so this is more of a geometric approach this I this had a little bit of geometry in it but it's only Pythagorean theorem this is actually kind of a a Economist or maybe a business approach this one's definitely going to be like um I don't want to say engineering because you're not doing any engineering uh but but dealing with more of a geometric figure okay so let's suppose that you're in the business of bottling Coca-Cola or some sort of cola and you want to come up with a can that holds the most amount of soda for the least amount of material right so when you see a can typically we design cans that that fit in your hand being they're easy to drink right but it's probably not the most honestly economical way that you could package something it's it's it's actually a little bit too long we want we'd have to have something more squat to save ourselves some material do you follow would you want to make a can that's like this round and this big drink my soda no probably not or unless you go to the Yard House you're probably not going to make a can that's this tall and that skinny right have you ever been to the Yard House yeah you know what I'm talking about that that beer that's this big it's a yard this big this big it' be like two yards but he go like that okay you're not going to do that if you want to say if you if you want to if you want to look cool then yeah of course but if you want to save money like with bottling you're not going to do that that'd be stupid so let's talk about we want to bottle 1,000 cubic cm not bottle I guess can we want a can 1,000 cubic cm how much is 1,000 cubic cm someone who's in science sciencey people is that a liter is it close to that is a liter right cubic centimeter is a milliliter is that true oh that's right we're doing right so we want to basically can a leader a or beer if you like beer a beer can I don't care make it excited to you we want to minimize the material needed to make that happen well you know what we better start with the picture just like always with these problems so let's start with a cold cam cool hey what are the dimensions of a can that you need to know what shape is a can so it's cylindrical what dimensions do you need R the height yeah is circular in nature if you're looking down the top of it so yeah definitely have to have something to do with the radius also have to do with the height for sure so let's uh let's go ahead and do this R is the radius H is the height and let's do this let's call S the surface area you follow because the surface area is the amount of aluminum or whatever you're going to make you can out of hopefully probably Al aluminum uh that you're going to need do you follow me on that so surface area would be the faces the top the bottom and the side of our cylinder there's also one more thing we have we have the V the volume now before we begin let me ask you something what are we trying to minimize here are we trying to minimize the volume are we trying to minimize the radius the height or the surface area surface that's the question is asking you it says minimize the material the material is the surface area not the volume the volume is actually constant do you see that that's the 1,000 that's not going to change we have to have it hold a liter full of soda because if it doesn't you're going to have in the in your Mills or your is it a mill a soda Mill we're get soda plant I don't know what they call it but they they they're going to fill full soda with a liter it's going either overflow or it's going to be way too too small in there so we want it to hold exactly a liter let talk about our formulas and we'll talk about any constraints we have let's do the formula first uh the formula if we're trying to figure out the the surface area for this thing note that what we really have have you ever thought about what a cylinder is have you ever cut a Pepsi can part I am cuz I'm I maybe you guys are interested to see what it actually looks like it really is just a rectangle with two circles on the top and bottom right so if you did this you take your rectangular piece of paper and you just fold it around and got this hold it around very well you got the cylinder and you just close it in with two circles you basically have a can follow so what this really looks like if I were to disassemble this and make the individual figures I've got the body of my cylinder I've got a circle and I've got a circle up and put the lids on that's that's your can so let's think about the surface area of this thing what's the distance from here to here r r is it the same r as this of course is this the same r as that it's a cylinder how far is it from here to here okay now now here's an interesting one this the weird one because we need to know that two right what's that circumference yeah that's the circumference of the circle it has to wrap around the circle right so whatever this is that's got to wrap all the way around it that's 2 pi r you okay with this so far welcome back to geometry geometry yeah actually some calculus is calculus and analytical geometry which this would probably take part of that uh but anyway do you see the figures that we have we get two of these Circle guys that are exactly the same we've got a rectangle that's 2 pi r long that's a weird way to think of a rectangle isn't it rectangle is 2 pi r long and it's h high so let's think of the formula for a surface area it's got to include two tops plus one let's call it the body do you follow that two tops two * now the top what's the we're talking about area right the area of these figures because surface area is what what we need here so what's the area of one of the tops R that's a circle yeah p r s so would you agree that the two tops together are 2 * the PK R 2 PK R squ gives you an area of a circle we have two of those circles therefore we have 2 * the p r squ yes add to it the the area of the body remember this is surface area surface area here what's the area of our our rectangle how do you find the area of a rectangle uh okay so 2i R * the H is exactly right feel okay with this so far you sure how many people do feel just fine with that it takes some work to really think about that doesn't it and of course I can't give you an example for every one that you're going to have but the idea of going through is the same draw a picture come with a formula come with some constraints now we're done with a formula that looks great to me almost great we we have too many variables we only we can only have one variable for this but we're going to have to use a constraint to make that work so the constraint what is the constraint sure something has to do with 1,00 cubic cenm what has to do with th000 Cub CM not the surface area the surface area is the material that we need we know nothing about the surface area Okay notice that you can make the surface area an infinite number of possibilities and still come up with a liter of col up like I said you could have you could have this as your can which holds a liter right that would be stupid but you could do it you could have this as your can which holds a liter but we want something that's going to minimize the surface area but still hold a liter the constraint is holds a liter holds 1,000 cubic cm you follow me so we need to come up with a volume we we also need that volume to equal 1,000 cubic cm does anyone know off the top of their head the volume of a cylinder it's not hard to figure out if you think about it P R pi r squ times the height circles stacked up on top of each other yeah very good and we said the volume had to be what now so if our volume is pqu which is the volume of the cylinder then we have 1,000k r^ 2 in do you feel okay with the surface area yes do you feel okay with the volume Y which one are we trying to minimize again the the volume or the surface area surface area so this is not what we're going to take a derivative of we're going to use this as our tool we're going to use this to solve for a variable plug it into here and take the derivative of this one because this right here is the thing that's going to give us our Max or men you right what variable do you want to solve for you want to solve for r or you want to solve for h h h most definitely H that's much easier to solve for if you solve for R you taking square roots plugging those things in over there they'd be kind of nasty right so probably solve for the h how do you solve this for H so if we do that we get the surface area that we're trying to minimize 2 pi r 2 we like that 2i R * H but H is now 1,00 overk R 2 feel right with this so far do you see why we need that substitution otherwise we're not going to be able to take a derivative uh at least not without using implicit and that'll be very difficult because we don't have a rate of change and implicit is not it's not with respect to time at all right so we can't use that stuff you're thinking why don't we do that it's not with respect to time this is not changing okay this is we want to figure out the minimum surface area here it's not a related rates of problem at all so here well we had to change it to one variable we only know how to take derivatives with one variable so we have the s = 2i r 2 plus what's this going to give you great 2000 I see that Pi's gone over R still all right probably do one more thing what are we going to have to do next what's the the next ideative it's a derivative now our constraint didn't come up with any end points you see that we didn't have any we can make the dimensions any way we want so we're really going to have to have to take a derivative to find out the maximum in here if if we have one so we're going to go ahead and take a derivative but before we take a derivative you might want to move what yeah shoot let's take our derivative well that's going to do is giv us our slope we know that absolute maximum and minimum if they're going to occur here they're going to occur at a critical number where we're we're changing from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing what' you getus 2000 what r r to the l two okay good I like what Michael say said put it over R squ maybe a little bit easier to think about right what are you going to do with that now that's your first R what do you do let's do that what now for got solve for R somehow probably a good way to go about it multiply both sides by r s need oh no no I'm sorry you know what I left I left out a step um I added that I did it all in my head I'm sorry it made sense to me okay so set it equal to zero add that over that way you have different sides of nothing you really do at this point maybe now multiply both sides by R 2 that way you're going to have R cub and maybe divide both sides by four Pi do you see what I'm talking about so that ultimately you're going to get you're going to get this multiply both sides by R 2 you get the r Cub divide by 4 pi and you get 2 4 Pi simplify a little bit what's 2,000 / 4 so then R Cub 500 Pi I'm not really interested in r how do you get rid of the cube take a cube of both sides that's great great idea if you're looking for an exact answer it's the cube root of 500 over Pi now if you work at pepsicola and they say what radius do we need and you go cube of 500 over Pi seriously can you please tell me what radius I need here and you're going to go say what now 23 really can you try it one more time that's 5.42 500 ID Pi take a cube root of that you're going to get the 5.4 5.42 what what is it not cubic that would be a volume this is a distance notice notice what you did you took a cube root right took a cube root that has cubic centimeters that would be centimet not inches oh goodness made that inch that's a huge can pull it it's like rers that's bigger than that 5.42 CM divide that by 2.54 and you get the inches right so you can figure that out if you really wanted to but that would be 5.42 CM roughly can you tell me how you would find your height out it's already Sol for H you plug it in believe you're going to get 10.8 you try that he's Tau this less before 10. 10.8 what 10. no 10 isn't it like 10.84 10.83 yeah it's it's twice the radius no it's exactly twice the radius is interesting think about it what this is weird but what maximizes volume of a c of a a rectangular prism prism if it's a cube right that's the least amount of surface area maximum amount of volume a cylinder if you had it the height as twice the radius think about what that says the radius is this distance that means it would be the height times the height that would basically be kind of a cylindrical version of the cube did you see that that's interesting kind of weird you can prove that it is twice the the the height is twice the radius if you do that what I want to do is more more calculus we have no way of verifying that this is actually a minimum or maximum right now right you're just guessing what if you accidentally minimize you didn't what if you what if you maximize the sary this is minimized but how you do it just go ahead take another derivative here that's going to be 4 Pi 6,000 over RB did you follow me yes no are you with me that that's a second derivative what does second derivative give you okay so plug in the r that you have now remember we're not worried about the actual number we're whe worried about whether this is positive or negative so think about this if I plug in 5.42 it will give me a concavity true it will either tell me concave up or concave down it won't be in most likely it won't be in inflection point um so if this is 5.42 5.42 cu is I don't care but it's positive 6,000 over a positive is a positive add things together this doesn't change right 4 Pi is positive positive plus a positive is a POS would you agree that at Ral 5.42 this is concave what is it because this is greater than zero so if we're concave up if we're concave up and this is the point where we change uh increas and decreasing or decreas which we actually didn't check that would have to be this point right that have to be that point so is that an absolute minimum for us for this range yes yeah that's a minimum we just minimized the surface area and you proved it the other way you prove this is you put this on your first derivative and you check two points one to the left and one to the right you check like um something like five and six and you say oh it's decreasing then it's increasing that's got to be a minimum that's other way you can check it how people feel okay with our good okay yeah my bad this actually should be a 4,000 not a 6,000 as previously on the video um I accidentally multiply by a three instead of a two so the -2 * the -2000 that's what's giving you the 4,000 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 4.1:  An Introduction to the Indefinite Integral
all right we start chapter four chapter four is like I said a switch from chapters three and everything before where we used derivatives before we're going to be using something different chapters four and five which is going to end our course in chapter four we discussed the second of the two main problems in calculus the first main problem in calculus where we spent the majority of our class I mean more than half of it was can you find the slope of a curve at a point what was that dtive the second question in calculus wasn't about the slope of the curve at a point it was can you find the area under a curve do you remember that question I introduced it I think like the first day of real calculus I said can we do this given some sort of continuous function from A to B can you find out what the area is between that curve and the x-axis so basically the area under the curve from here to here and the answer is yeah yeah and we actually have two ways to do it I'm going to introduce to you what's called the rectangular method today uh we will deal much more with it in section 4.4 4.3 4.4 uh they're kind of tied together on how to actually do this with rectangular method but I'm going to introduce it to you today and then we'll talk about what's called the anti-derivative method uh which is a more concise way to do it are you ready for it so the this I'm going to kind of go in a weird Loop I'm going to introduce this with the rectangular method we'll talk about anti-derivatives anti-derivatives then I'll use rectangular method to kind of prove what we just learned about anti-derivatives you follow me so we have to wait till 4.3 to prove some of the stuff I'm talking about here today I'm going to give you kind of an intuitive approach on it though hopefully it makes sense for you so first method let's talk about the rectangular method and at least the idea behind it so rectangle method rectangle method says well why don't you divide your interval into n some number and equal subsections equal as far as their width goes subsection sub intervals whatever you want to call it and create a rectangle in each sub interval in each subsection hence where we get the the term rectangle method or rectangular method so here's basically the idea let me redraw the picture for you let's say that I make this a little bit bigger too here's my graph here's my interval the idea behind the rectangle method is can you find the area under this curve the way it is no not really because we don't have a formula for this and even if we did it doesn't have straight sides and only way we know how to take an area up till right now in Geometry is if a figure has straight sides right whether we can break it up into rectangles or triangles because we know how to take the areas of those figures or perfect circles you know how to take the areas of those figures this this is not a regular shape that we know of it's just some random function in fact that hasn't even been specific it could be any function but the idea is let's go ahead let's break this up we'll say okay we're going to split this up into however many parts we choose let's just assume those are equal widths that's about right it says if we have some sections here what we're going to do in each section since they have equal widths so what I'll I'll tell you why we need equal widths uh later on in section 4.3 4.4 but right now let's just assume we have some equal widths that's so our bases are all the same our rectangles equal bases means they're easy to add together that's basically it so for each each interval sub interval let's make a rectangle now there are several ways to do this I'll show you one way the problem is now you got to determine how you're going to have the height of our rectangle so one way to do this is to use what's called Left End points another way is to use right end points and a third way is to use midpoints and here's what that means you go to the right end point of your interval here's my interval I go to the right end point I'd say I'm going to go up to where that touches my figure does that make sense to you a left end point would say I'm going to go up to where my left Point touches my rectangle a midpoint would say go to the middle see where that touches the figure and then make your rectangle that would determine your height so we have left end points where that touches right end points where that touches or midpoints let me show you the midpoints and here's how you do it okay from my midpoint i' go up here where it touches that F ofx whever my function is that's where I cut it off and that makes my rectangle does that make sense to you why do that well it's actually not going to matter when we when when we finish 4.4 we'll talk about what's called the definite integral it doesn't matter whether you use left right or Center uh but for us if we are always using one end point sometimes you can systematically over underestimate the area and that would be a problem for us then this one would go okay let's go up where that touches I'll draw the top of my rectangle finish it off and you would do this for every interval that you have how do people feel okay about the idea here the idea of drawing rectangles there do you see where the midpoints coming into play here midpoint gives us the height of our rectangle that's going to be useful when we get down to 4.3 and 4.4 very useful now how would I find the area of this figure the approximation of this area what would I do with this rectang together if we know the area of a rectangle which we do right a rectangle is just a GE geometrical figure if I can find this area and this area and this area and this if I can find all the areas of all my rectangles all I have to do is add them together and I'm going to get at least an approximation of the area of my Figure You Follow Me Now is it going to be exact well you can tell it's not I mean sometimes I've overestimated sometimes I've left out some area sometimes it's about right but sometimes and I don't know whether I'm I'm perfect or not so I'm not going to be exactly right it it'd be a miracle if it was exactly right it's not going to be a miracle this isn't Harry Potter mathematics so magic doesn't happen uh in math sometimes but anyway that's another topic I suppose uh it's not going to be exact it's going be approximation now the question is how can I make this better Tak number so would you agree that the more rectangles I have the better approximation this will be so I mean here I had 1 2 3 4 5 I had six rectangles if I had 100 rectangles for the same width 100 rectangles mashed up in there I'm going to over underestimate by a less margin lesser of a margin right so the more rectangles I have the better approximation becomes so as the number of rectangles n goes to infinity or as the space between the rectangles goes to zero right does that make sense as space as this goes really really close to zero that's the idea of a limit as that goes to zero then I have a very very good approximation effect so good that it's exact so the idea here is cut your region into rectangles every rectangle you're going to take the area of that add all the rectangles together and you're get a good approximation of your figure how do I make it better you let the number of rectangles go to Infinity the way you do that is let the space between them go to zero for a better approximation make the space between each interval notice that in this context the space between each interval that's the width of a rectangle approach zero and again the idea is well think about it if you have a finite distance A to B and you let the distance of each sub interval go to zero how many how many rectangles you going to have if you have a finite space and you let the distance between here and here go to zero you can pack in an infinite number of rectangles right if you pack in an infinite number of rectangles you will have no over underestimate it'll basically be like finding the area under a distinct point which is impossible you can't do that but if you say really really really small and you can't put even put a paper between it then it'll be exact and that's the idea that's the limiting factor same kind of basic concept of a derivative right we took the distance and made it zero and we're taking the distance and making it zero very similar idea only now we're talking about an area instead of a slope how people understood the idea of this good that's fantastic uh more on this in section 4.3 and 4.4 this is all you get for right now just a little taste this is appetizer are you satisfied no of course you're not that's why you need more of a meal this is the meal okay different method anti-derivative method that no it's up th head pretty good I suppose if that's the appetizer this is like the salad and the main course and we tied it all together the dessert and then the chapter five is icing on the cake baby just how to use it if you like cake inser your favorite is here you don't put icing on a crem bluet burn it burn you do you do Burn It Anyway anti- driven method this I'm going to go a little bit past where the book takes you the book has you do just what anti uh how to do anti-derivatives what I'm going to do is tell you what an anti-derivative stands for and then how to do them you're going to find out now I'm going to prove this to you after we do 4.3 and 4.4 so I'm going a little bit beyond that if AMX here's kind of the special deal this is what you find out the end game of uh section 4.4 is this basically if a ofx stands for the area under a curve for some function if a ofx is the area function for some f ofx some curve like this like this for f ofx on some interval I've got to give you an interval otherwise you can't find an area does that make sense you have to have an interval areas are a definite thing uh we'll talk about definite integrals later on but areas are definite you have to have points have numbers then here's what I'm going to tell you this kind of a very cool thing uh this is where we're going to end up again I I said five times now this is where we're going to end up after section 4.3 and 4.4 you get it we're going to end up with this statement which is a fantastically marvelous statement it's magical right now because you don't know the concept behind it but it's magical what it says is um this thing right here is an are this thing is an area right it says if you take this is kind of crazy to think about but if you take the derivative that's sense for derivative right you take the derivative of your area function it will give you your original function it will give you the line the curve so basically it says this if your area function represents the area take a derivative and you get the function back does that make sense to you it shouldn't really nothing all that much I'm going to prove this to you later I'm not proving it yet what you need to know right now is that if you are given an area function take a derivative of that thing and it will give you your function back well now that's that's cool but we're never going to start with this we're always going to start with our line right that's what we want to get to so well this implies this thing this says if we want to find the area under a certain function we basically need to be able to undo this we need to undo a derivative for some interval let me go through this one time for you so you kind of get the the interplay here here's what it says it says the area of a curve is a ofx what I know for sure is if I take the first derivative of the area that's equivalent to my curve itself so if I want to find the area under my curve this statement is true right the first derivative of the area is the function so if I want to find the area of the curve under the curve what I'm going to do is undo the derivative that gives me the area so basically here's the idea you pretend you pretend that your function is a derivative if you undo that thing and treat like a derivative you're going to find What's called the anti-derivative that is the area under the curve that's the idea of the anti-derivative method we'll get more into it in a second I'll prove it to you uh well I'll prove it with an example I have to prove it to you with 4.3 and 4.4 later on or prove it a couple examples so if we're going to find the area under the curve under F ofx we must undo a prime of x to find a of X the area would you like uh an example that you can actually kind of see I was hoping you'd say that have I lost you yet no halfway you get this right yes oh good good now this is not what we're talking about today so it's good for 4.3 do you get this no you don't yet trust me you don't you don't you won't get it fully until 4.3 4.4 uh the idea is can you find anti-derivative I'm going to teach you that in a second but I want you to understand the concept behind it as well the concept is we're trying to find the area under a curve that's why I gave you this this introduction that's the idea so I'm trying to get that in your head remember how I always kept saying what's a derivative what's a derivative you're like oh my gosh SL c a point you know that right good because I pounded it in your head and that's when to do the same thing here what we're doing is we're finding the area under a curve that's what an anti-derivative is what I've told you and I've done it without proof I'm not going to prove it till later I've told you this I said the first derivative of your area is your function so if I can undo my function by treating it as a derivative I will find the area function so basically we need to go backwards from a derivative did you get that if the are if the uh if the function is the first derivative of the area that's what that says the function is the first of the area if I can undo the derivative I get my area that's theidea that's the anti-derivative method in a nutshell very quick statement now let me do some of some of this with geometry um to show you that it does in fact work then we'll get on into some anti-derivatives and how to do those things so example if we have a function f ofx = X+ one I give you something easy to graph because I'm going to show you the graph in a second I want us to find the formula for the area on 1 tox now this is would kind of be stupid if I give you just 1 to three because we could just use the triangle and find the area but what I want to find is 1 to X and I I'll show you why this Works according to that first off can you graph this jez I hope so what's your Y intercept what you slope would you agree that that is your function we're trying to find the area of that between what I say negative 1 oh you know what I want negative one let's make that negative much much more interesting negative 1 to X now I don't know where X is I made it positive but it doesn't have to be positive what we're talking about wherever this x is is the area of that shaded region now keep in mind that this function is x + 1 what shape is that can you find the area of a triangle yes of course you can yes let's find the area of a triangle the area in terms of X notice I'm using the same terminology I used over here right that's an area function the area in terms of X wherever X happens to be is how do you find the area of a triangle again very good 12 BAS side so I'm going to write 12 base height so that would be 1 oh my gosh what's the base oh let's think about that what's the base is the base x xus one oh close how do you find the distance between two points between two numbers subract you subtract them you subtract the numbers right you subtract then so this would be the distance between here and here is xus not one not one this would be the distance between here and here would be x - one right there going to be a difference here so it' be x -1 yeah that's x + one do you see where we're getting x + one well I mean you can see it you can just see it on the graph really just intuitively this distance is X right yes that's one more unit that's x + one not x - one that would be over here so we have x + one SO2 okay that's x + 1 okay uh oh my gosh what's the height what's the height F okay f of x h no H's you don't want any hes you're thinking I like the thoughts I good thinking you have good thoughts none I'm happen to be right right now but that's okay all right uh tell me something if this was a three if that was a three what would the height be very good if this was a seven what would the height be eight eight you all see SE the the eight if this is an X what is the height x + one you're taking the number you're adding one to it that's what the height is so this height whatever this x is right doesn't even matter if it's here if it's a one then it's 1 plus 1 it's two so this height X+ one you okay on the height of X+ one the function says the height right that's what the function means so take the value the value is X plug it into the function by plug in x i I just get X x + 1 that's what we do we don't plug it in to get X squ that's not what we do we're not squaring the number and then adding one we're just plugging the number in I said if that's a three you get 3 + 1 if that was a seven you get 7 + 1 if that's an X you get x + 1 whatever it is plus one how many people understandig feel okay with that good then our height is also x + one you okay with this so far I'm just kind of proving this for you with an example it's not a genuine proof but I'm I'm showing you that it does work if I distribute this I'm going to get let's see 12 that's x^2 + 2x + 1 do you believe me you should cuz that's right come on now if I distribute the 1/2 even further I get x^2 2 + x + 12 you follow me with that so far okay now here's a cool deal would you agree that whatever I tell you for X you could find the area of that triangle if I said X is n could you find the area of a triangle yes you could you just plug in nine this is in fact our area function because we made it up geometrically it's just the base times the height divid two that's all we've done so far so good now what I want you to do is do some magic this is the area function I want you to take a first derivative of that would you do that for me [Applause] I hope you got magic hope so is not that very magic I told you it was going to happen but what's the first derivative of a and that we we denote that a prime right that's the first R of a what's this X very good because you bring the two down the twos simplify you get X what's this what's this Z aha does that look familiar yeah in fact this is your function that's true every time right the derivative of your area is going to give you your function every time that's going to happen that's just basically one example showing that this is is true for this example now it doesn't prove it at length I will do that later uh but it shows you that you can do it shall we do one more would you like to see one more okay I'm going to kind of start simplifying this a little bit [Applause] okay you know X squ looks like right okay now this is only between zero and one so I'm not going to draw the left side of this I'm just going to draw that do you all see that that's the area we're talking about right there yeah no is that a triangle is it an exact triangle no okay so we can't do the same thing but we're going to use the idea the idea is here's the idea if F ofx = X2 and FX also equals the first derivative of our area function you believe that right right mhm then the first derivative of our area function equals X2 that's a basic substitution it says if our function is X2 and we know that a function is equal to the first derivative of its area function you follow me on that then we say all right well if FX is X2 then X2 equals that that's that's our jump there can you make the jump okay so basically we're asking this question can you find a function whose derivative is X2 that's the question you ask can you find a function and you know what we're going to call it a of X CU that's going to be our area can you find a function a ofx whose derivative is X2 let's try a couple let's just let's just have some fun and try a couple right we know how to take derivatives pretty easily let's try one let's try uh well if we use some common sense or some critical thinking I should say would you agree that you need a power bigger than two probably because when you take a derivative that power decreases by one right so let's try X CU does it work no because this is going to give you a prime of X = 3x^2 right that's not going to work okay so we need to get rid of the three somehow so if I can somehow undo the UND divide by three then maybe oh let's try that let's try X cubed over 3 would that work let's try if I take the derivative of that thing what I would do is I I'd bring down the three right the three and the over three are going to be gone I'm going to get X squar okay does that work yeah this one not so much no this one yes worked how many people feel okay with that so far so you're undoing the you're going backwards so is it related to derivative absolutely but you're going the other way and we had something something unique right we had to have this over three somehow now let me ask you another question it's going to blow your mind up like a mind grenade what's the derivative of that what about the there's another one works this very cool actually what about that any Conant any constant any con no matter what it is any constant is going to go away when you take a DP right so what you actually get here is a family of Curves Each of which would work as an area function so here's what we've done we've started with this function and we've said okay I know the function is actually a first derivative of an area function whatever that happens to be so I'm going to set my first Dera of the area function equal to it I'm going to undo that treatent like a derivative and undoing a derivative that's why we call it the hey anti-derivative method okay you're undoing anti it's opposite of derivative means derivative so undoing opposite of you're undoing a derivative that's what we're doing here now unfortunately for us this is a this is situation right we have one two and we have an infinite number of possibilities for the area function that it could actually should be and in general that's what you have to put you have to put that some your zone out you have to put that plus C the plus C is important it represents a family of Curves Each of which could be the area function now I've also said some specific things about this I said between 0 and one which is going to help us out a little bit but if I didn't say that this would be the general area functions of X2 of X that's that's what it would be you'd have to have more spe specific information in order to give me an actual verified area do you follow me on that you have to have that so do you mind if I go over here do you have any questions about this one are you with me so far that there's more than just one of them right now was the first for you you actually asked before say what you actually asked before erasing I know right I was polite today oops so a ofx = 1/3 or X Cub over 3 + C C is a constant C is also the Y intercept of a ofx if something's the Y intercept of a function you should be able to find it by plugging in zero true so what this means is that a of 0 if I plug in xal 0 can you verify that that's going to give me just the C 0 Cub over 3 is0 plus C so it's going to give me c now I don't want to blow your mind up too much but for this for this context do you understand that this this area curve is from 0 to X wherever X is in this case that's what that stands for so this interval that interval is 0 to X this one might throw you for Loop but I need you to stick with me okay if this is the area if this is the area from 0 to x from 0 to X do you follow me on that it's from 0 to X and we are finding the area from zero to what do we plug in for x one no we didn't plug in one to find the to find this what did you plug in you plug in zero when you plugged in zero What's the area from0 to zero What's the are that's basically saying what's the area of a single point can you find the area of a single point point a point is that which has no breadth so that means you have no width there so you can't find an area 0 times whatever the height is but you still get zero so I know this is this is kind of awkward to think about the the area of a single point but that's what you're doing here you're saying all right I'm going from0 to I plugged in x equals 0 that's how I got this that's zero so what this says [Applause] is this is basically the area of a single point when you set x = 0 your interval is from 0 to Z that's the area under a single point the area under a single point is always zero if you took any statistics at all you know this uh with continuous distribu uh if you ask what's the probability of an exact number it's always zero you can't get it because there's infinite number of possibilities that's the same same idea the area is zero so when you set xal 0 the interval is 0 0 that is the area under a single point [Applause] and that's zero so what this says is from here here's what this says it's two parts I I sneeze oh it didn't come out oh don't you hate that were you all ready for it and then nothing oh I hate that then your nose tickles like yeah I hate it nose tickles oh bummer that actually look like you sneeze for a second I tried I kind of pretended just so it look good on camera value effort thanks so here's what this this part says this says if you're if you're going to plug in zero your area goes from Z to zero that's area under single point that is zero this part says well I know when I plug in zero to my function I get C therefore if a of 0 equals 0 and a of 0 equals c how much does c equal Z yeah right what that says is though even though we had the C we had to take care of the C the C doesn't always have to be zero it can it can be numbers too we're talk about um initial value problems later on like later on this section you might have some C's that are numbers this one you get a zero so this this is what you'd be able to do from this part after you find your C you go okay then the area of that curve is X Cub over 3 now you can start plugging numbers in now that you dealt with a C on the interval of 0 to 1 the area is well let's fill that in our area went from 0 to X can you tell me what is the x value of our interval there where we're stopping you can now plug that in now that you have that c you know the C is zero right you you be able to plug in the x of one you go okay well then the area that stops at one is 1 cubed over 3 or 1/3 square units now that's our idea did you follow the idea I've given it to you in terms of geometry right now I've showed you some interesting ideas with area to kind of Flesh this thing out a little bit right now we're going to take a jump away from the actual area I just wanted to introduce it to you so it was a very long introduction do you understand the introduction how many people do you feel okay with it so rectangular method is you cut it into rectangles we'll talk about that later anti-derivative method is you go okay the first root of the area is my function let's undo a derivative that gives us an anti-derivative we somehow have to have to mess around with the c we have to figure out what C's are I'll show you better ways to do this as we go on by the way better yeah don't I need you to understand the idea you need to get the idea I'll show you some short cuts and and ways to work around that you you follow but you have to understand the idea now we're going to practice most of the rest of our time in this section on how to actually do the anti-derivatives this was fun but I haven't showed you any techniques on how to do that yet I've said basically you need to be able to undo it and we kind of guessed and checked over here would you like some better ways to do this yes absolutely so we're going to start talking about that this is called the indefinite integral indefinite means that I'm not going to give you boundaries yet I'm not going to give you zero to one yet that be would be a definite integral that would be the area between the points that's what we were able to find right an actual number what I'm going to leave you with is how to get down to here that part this would be indefinite it say you have a plus c you don't know where you're stopping you don't know where you're starting it's just an indefinite integral because I haven't given you a range of numbers therefore you can't find the definite area we're just having the function of the area do you see the difference there if you didn't catch what I said rewind that and repeat that some of you guys kind of like weird looks you you don't quite get that I'm I'm going to leave it here I'm not going to give you numbers and start and stop at I'm going to leave you here show you how to get this and later on we'll talk about how to do the whole thing together so remember this is an introduction so indefinite integral means that you're not going to be able to find the area definitely that's why we call it indefinite oh yeah I guess I should call it this would be like a subsection so there's a new word in the board integral I'll bring it I'll bring down to what an integral actually is is it's not a hard concept um given a function let's call it f on some interval it's called it I I know this doesn't start out so fun right now okay it sounds sounds boring it's it's not that bad stupid given a function f on some interval I capital F is called the anti-derivative please make a note here this is also the area function okay in general we call the anti-derivative just the capital letter of whatever the function is so if we have a function F the anti-derivative is capital F that's all we're saying here it will stand ultimately for the area function of your curve did you follow me on that that's what we'll stand for f is called an anti-derivative if this is true if you can take the first derivative of your capital F your anti-derivative and it equals your FX you'll notice I used the word an instead of the word thee think back to like 10 seconds ago maybe like 30 seconds ago when I said you had a plus c you can actually almost see it in the purple writing that doesn't quite erase that well remember how we had several actually infinite number of functions that you could take a derivative of and it will give you your original function back again that's why I say and that plus C gives you a whole bunch of them a whole lot of them and so what we're doing here is we're saying f f should be some function that when I take a derivative of it it gives me my function I'm looking at that's what happens that's what an anti-derivative is known as now we just talked about it like this right same stuff a was the anti-derivative f is the anti-derivative same stuff okay okay let me give you the example that we just talked about so capital F is the same say a of so same same as area okay you remember this example right in fact it's uh it was on the board it's on the board right there here's what we would say for this we would say that F ofx has an anti-derivative of capital F ofx and capital F ofx should be 1/3 or X Cub over 3 you okay with this so far is this the anti-derivative or an anti-derivative one it's one of many it's one of many this is an anti-derivative this is one anti der I'm going say anti-d why is it anti-derivative why well look it if you take a derivative of this does it not equal this why because the derivative with respect to X of this thing is this thing which is FX that's why it works this is all I'm saying here folks an anti-derivative is this property says I take a derivative of it and it gives me a function that's what it is this is one of those are there more there are many more there are infinitely many more I gave you I give you another one um another F ofx would be X Cub over 3 - 4 is that another one that's another that's another one of those anti-derivatives that's why in general all of them will have this form that's why we have the plus C to say okay you know what I'm kind of tired of writing every constant over here I don't want to write minus 4 I don't want plus three I don't want to write plus whatever I don't want 0 plus pi minus one2 that's all garbage I don't want to write that I want to represent this this represents all of the possible anti-derivatives do you follow me on that I can't have any other X's because that would alter the derivative but constants don't because when you take a derivative of a constant it gives you zero Z so this right here is all anti-derivatives the family of all anti-derivatives and that is also the interr I'll talk about that next time this represents the family of all possible anti-derivatives for f ofx = x^2 all possible anti-derivatives will other functions have different anti-derivatives of course they work of course they will other functions have different derivatives so they will have other anti-derivatives uh what I will do next time is I will talk to you about what an integral is what uh integration is it's basically you're find out the same thing as doing anti-derivative so I'll show you some notation that will be where we continue our study of calculus has brought us to this point where we're not talking about derivatives So Much Anymore in fact we're basically doing the opposite of a derivative from last time we learned that if a function has an area under its curve that's the area function or in other words that's the anti-derivative so basically it's left to us to undo a function by pretending it's a derivative and saying how can I reverse the process of taking a derivative that process is called anti-differentiation or finding the anti-derivative we we left with this example the anti-derivative of X2 is 1/3 x Cub + C why the plus C good yeah the point of anti-derivative was if I take a derivative of it in other words the derivative of3 XB + C it will give me back my original function that's the idea of an anti-derivative I take a derivative of it it gives me my original function back does that make sense to you the plus C is there because well any constant is going to go away when I take a derivative so that is the basically a family of Curves a family of area curves for which when I take a derivative of it it gives me my my original function back did you understand that from last time that's basically a last time concept now the process of finding anti-derivative is also known as integration so when you hear the word integration or find the integral it means find the anti-derivative does that make sense to you so anti-derivative and integral or anti- differentiation and integration synonymous they mean the same thing this process and I mean the process of finding the anti-derivative is also called integration integration let me show you something here here's what basically our definition in a nutshell this this is really it our definition of an anti-derivative in a nutshell says if I take the derivative I even have it on the board already if I take the derivative of my anti-derivative it gives me back my original function do you follow that if I take the derivative of this thing it must give me this thing do you follow okay there's another way that we're going to write this you see this is kind of confusing because this doesn't let us go from here to here right right this basically just says if I do this thing it will give me this thing you follow so we're going to write this a little bit differently we're going to introduce a symbol called the integral remember an integral means find the anti-derivative or perform integration which is to find the anti- derivative so this and what I'm about to write mean exactly the same thing this says if I take a derivative of the anti-derivative it gives my function this says if I find the integral of my function it will give me my anti-derivative plus C because we don't know the constant right we talked about that already it's a family of Curves by the way is that c important that constant yeah that's two points on a test or every time so you have to have the C that represents I don't know the exact integral as far as the constant and it represents a family of Curves for which I take a derivative and I get back my original so this this constant must be there and this right here is called your indefinite integral I think I referenced that before I said it's indefinite an indefinite integral because you don't have any boundaries you don't know where you're going basically right now all we're doing is finding the area function it's very similar to this you remember when I had had to find derivatives you ended with things in terms of X right so while that represented a slope it wasn't an actual slope until you plug a number in do you follow me this is the same thing this is going to represent an area but it's not an actual area until you plug something into it and that's why it's called indefinite and not definite definite would be I'm able to plug numbers in and I get areas out this is called the indefinite interval the indefinite integral and these things say exactly the same thing interchangeable this one says take a derivative of your anti-derivative you get the function this says find the integral of your function what this says is this it says find the anti-derivative of this there it is that that's the whole idea do you understand the notation we will do why is the DNX there that's a good question I'll give you that in just a second um that DX tells you what you're taking the integral with respect to so what your variable has to be so this DX right here says I'm taking this with respect to X so that variable has to be X if it's not we can't do it does that make sense it's got to be there and we we'll talk about this a little bit more as we go on and on uh basically I want to get down the the names the notation what's that called that's integral symbol or integral that's right what this means is find the anti-derivative or undo this as if it were a derivative of something so give me some function that I can take a derivative of and it will give me back what you start with that's the whole idea right here you okay with this so far one note this is also true hope this doesn't blow your mind but I'm I'm basically restating things a few different ways so you see them a couple ways let's see if you can manage to do this this is kind of critical thinking on a a lower level what's that stand for integral or what else was it called anti that's an anti-derivative right what you suppose would happen if I took a derivative of the anti- derivative what do you think it's going to give me basic function the F ofx this is true that's true statements well that DX I'll make the note right here that DX tells you what variable we are integrating with respect to so this right here says which variable to integrate for instance as why when we did this um now can actually have symbols for it let's go ahead and try to do an example that we had like probably five times but just so you get the symbols down we've actually done this problem I think we've done it I've had on the board several times we've actually done it twice the integral of x^2 DX says I want you to find the anti-derivative of this function what's the function with respect to the variable X that that should match up that has to match up for you to do it okay can't do it it doesn't at least not with our our single variable calculus that we're doing so if we're doing the integral of x^2 DX we're going to find the anti-derivative of X2 what's the anti-derivative of X2 actually already have that yeah that's the 1/3 or X Cub over 3 is 5 that doesn't quite do it yet we also have to have it's crucial we got to have that plus c ohus c right canus C well if you had minus C you could write that as plus negative C right so you're always going to write plus C so C is just some arbitrary constant that can stand for anything that's how you do most of these problems right now you find it says anti-derivative of this function with respect to that variable and we know how to do at least one of them right but we don't know how to do any other one so right now what I'm going to do I'm going to give you the basic integration table listen if it doesn't fit in the Bas basic integration table you cannot do it right now okay you can't create your own calculus here you if you do you're better than Isaac Newton or godfre lies who invented the stuff way back in the day that day was 1600s so uh probably not going to happen so don't invent this just follow the table you do have to memorize it I'm not going to put this on the board but trust me you will the only tough ones are really the uh some of the trig ones that I'm going to give you right now some of the ing integrals are are hard to memorize but think of it this way you already know the derivatives right we're just undoing them so that's where all this stuff's going to come from in fact the table I'm about to give you is going to have the derivative and then the integral that's associated with it you ready for it okay so this is called integration table Yeah basic integration table to see table would look like you know there's a lot of them there's a lot of integration tables yeah most of the back of your book has just all those weird pages right the look what are all those the curvy things someone had fun just scribbling no no no those are integrals and they mean something right they all have different formulas uh by the way this this long what is that thingal it's integral but what does it look like what letter it's an S and what we're going to come across in section 4.3 is that that's actually a sum it's going to blow your mind but remember how I told you that you can add all the rectangles together that's what you're doing it's a sum it's a sum sum with a limit basically that's where the DX comes from I'll show you all this I'll make it very clear to you as we get there but this is what we're doing this is a way that you're adding all the infinite rectangles together and getting an area you get it kind of cool kind of cool it all makes sense in a little while so basic integration table like I said I'm going to start you off with the derivatives and we're going to come up with the integrals that that are corers of them because we know an integral undes a derivative right so if we know the derivative we should be able to somehow manage to get an integral out of that so let me ask you this what's the derivative we'll start very simply what's the derivative of X with respect to X very good one dtive of X is simply one derivative of 2x would be 2 4X would be four so the dtive of X is is one what that means is this hopefully you find out what I'm going to do here what's the integral of one what do you think if the derivative of x is one the integral has to undo a derivative that's what this says here a derivative undes an integral an integral undes a derivative so they have to go in reverse there are like inverse operations like division multiplication addition subtraction square and square root same idea so if the derivative of x is one the integral of one is X sure why think about it you're undoing this like it's a derivative right that means if you take a derivative of this thing it should give you back that does it now we're missing something here plus C you okay with this so far okay you know let's do this in general what was a derivative of x to the r power what do you do with that what do you do okay we add one to the I'm I'm sorry I'm talking about derivatives here derivatives how do you take a derivative of that- Rip r okay multiply by R first and then subtract one from the r yes so like X Cub you'd have 3x^2 so this would be r x to the r minus one you follow me on that okay that means that an integral should go in completely the reverse order so where we took a derivative we multiplied and then we subtracted right the reverse order of that is ADD and then divide by that new number does that make sense to you so here we we multiplied first and then we subtracted for an integral that goes reverse that means you're going to add and then divide add and then divide so our integral says I'm going to take oops not our X I'm going to take my X I'm going to add one going to add one to that exponent and what do you think am I going to divide by r r minus one or r + one R look what you do here look we actually did this right how to you get from here to here you add one but you don't divide by two you divide by three why because when you take a derivative of it the three has to match up with that go away right so you're you're matching up the new exponent with that denominator do you follow that so this isn't R it's not Rus one it's r + one C basically it says this in English you add one to the exponent and divide by the new exponent that's what that says in English you add one to the to the exponent and divide by the new expon shouldn't that be RX R yeah this one yeah nope no I'm I'm kind of changing here I don't want to have this over here I don't want to do the same thing I'm just kind of using this as a a template to what you're you're doing you're doing this in Reverse right so this says you're multiplying and subtracting this says you're adding and dividing by the new exponent I don't want to make it look exactly the same in this case and I know you can but it's going to give you back x r what I want to give you is things so you can do this actually the F cuz not you're integrals aren't always going to look like this this would be way too easy they're not always going to look like that okay not not going to do that yeah no this sure that would be X to 5th too easy but what happens when you get something like this well then you have to know I'm going to add one to that I'm going to divide by the new exp I'm going to put a c and that's the correct thing so when I take a derivative of this it will give me back that does that make sense to you that's the way this has to work so yeah I know that these don't match up exactly I know that also one more thing I do have to mention before we go any further notice that sometimes you're going to have this as I even have a one because really we don't even write ones most of the time in mathematics so if ever you see the integral DX you go what's in there it's a one it's a one or integral of 2 DX well that that would be 2x but this this that stands for the one between the uh between the function you want integrated and the DX do you need parentheses there you don't not unless you have um a few terms have a polinomial in there or something you may or you may not um often times people don't put parentheses in there because it's implied that you're going from the integral to where it says DX okay which by the way you must have the DX if you don't have that DX I mean that says you're not even integrating anymore you don't you don't have respective which variable you have to have that it also closes off your integration does that make sense to you it's kind of like the limit remember on the limits how you had to keep writing limit over and over and over and over again if you didn't I went ha I laughed at you and I crossed out your papers and I burn them well not really but you had to have it it it's a must because that's the same idea are you okay with these so far some of you still don't like this I know get used to it if you don't like this you're going to hate me on the next view not this one uh can you tell me what's the derivative of sign yes very good with that in mind what what's the integral of cosine sin plus C sin plus C good yeah very good do you feel okay with the the integral of cosine it's it's nice to think of these as I'm looking for the reverse of a derivative I'm looking for something that when I take a derivative of it it gives me back that thing do you follow that's what you're trying to do the reason why we have it this way is because if you take a derivative of this thing you bring down r + one those cross out you subtract one from the r + one and you get R that's why we have't written that way how about some more got about five more to do functions please don't freak out with this but I'm going to do this a little differently I told her not to freak out she uh the derivative of cosine what's the derivative of cosine now stop stop I'm going to change this because you know what we don't want to do we don't want to have derivatives sorry integrals of weird things I don't want to know what the integral of Nega sinx is cuz are you going to see negative sin x no probably not you're going to see see things like sinx do you get it so I'm trying to make this thing this thing into the thing I have over here The Only Exception is that one we don't write the minus one we have it in in terms of R so you see it more clearly but this if this gives you Nega if the the derivative of cosine gives you negative s what's the derivative of negative cosine give you s do you get me that's what I want to here I don't want to know NE integral of negative sign I want the integral of sign that's why I changed that okay you agreed that the derivative of negative cosine was positive s you agreed with that so what's the integral of s cosine are these going to take some practice to memorize you bet you yeah you bet you you go in a reverse of derivatives the opposite thing backwards OPP no no you're you're lucky there's no such thing as that there's worse things and where do we get lucky at you don't Lear them in this class that's next semester it is not 4 okay derivative of tan X what's the derivative of tan x f s x okay this should be pretty pain I mean painless now this one's pretty easy that means what's the integral of^ 2 x 10 x I like the plus C I heard it plus C by the way uh look at the board here real quick is it plus C like this it's actually plus C like this okay whatever the angle is and then the plus C is the very very end okay three more well let's see if you remember this one um do you remember and I'm going to change this so don't get too excited y the derivative of coent yes negative cose if if tangent is secant cotangent is cose square with a negative with a negative in front of it do you know what I'm going to do I bet you can you can see it it's the same thing I'm going to do over here or same thing I did over here if I have coent the derivative of cotangent gives me negative cose what I want this to be is positive cose so look what I can do I can say okay if coent gives me negative cose negative Cent should give me positive cose s are you still okay with that one so I'm just moving negatives around basically and the reason is because I want to have my cosecant here to be positive I don't want to have the negative cosecant in there so what's the integral of cose s x that's that the integral has to undo [Music] that don't forget to Plus two more SE see do you know see someone on the right side do you know SE right side right side right side middle yes that's some work to do side by the way don't forget that X it's not secant tangent X it's see X tangent X see X time tangent X so this is like this well then what's the integral of see X tangent X yeah plus C if you know this one you can pretty much figure this one out has a negative but you can pretty much figure this one out yeah make flash cards up make flash cards up or something you need these you ever done flash cards before there's these like cards that you flash not like blink or Flash gra the back side and go integral integral of s tangent second squ oh yeah no but make sure you have them you also probably know what I'm going to do with this one I don't want that negative there I want the negative here so if Co the derivative of cose gives you negative cosecant Cent then the derivative of negative cosecant gives you positive cosecant Cent so I'm going to change that around that way I have the integral of cose xent x DX don't forget the DX is cose X plus C a't it fun isn't it cool that's not too bad here's the here's the bright side the bad side is this stuff sucks right I mean this hard to memorize especially these four these ones not so bad this is easy this is easy this is pretty easy because you deal with s and cosine more often this is okay you know what you know where people mess up I guarantee you you know where people mess up where you're going to mess up if you make a mistake where you going to mess up signs the signs the sign positive negative all the time because you're used to doing this just think about it think about it for a second if the derivative of s is cosine the integral of s can't you can't have the same thing both ways right the derivative of s can't be cosine and the integral of sign be cosine something has to change there so here the integral of sign yeah it's negative cosine the reason is the derivative of cosine would give you negative sign so the derivative of negative cosine would give you positive sign you can think through it but it's harder people make most of the mistakes with signs almost all the time that's where where all of it happens so do that stuff the bright side is if it does not fit in this table you can't do it right now I'm going to show you one exception to that one just one uh it's a it's called integration by substitution it's very easy but again what you get must fit in this table if it doesn't fit you can't do it that's a good thing and a bad thing good thing because if it's out of our realm you won't even come up with it so you know you're going have an answer it's a bad thing because sometimes it's hard to make things fit and so I'm going to show you some examples on this uh but memorize these tables I'm going to need to erase them are there any questions before I begin did you see how I got all of them basically just undoing derivatives is the whole idea of integrals it's why it's called an anti-derivative all the T you right down the board uh no nice try good TR okay I'm I'm not getting that one anymore we we dealt with that one four times how about this one the integral of x to 4th DX does it fits your table yes that's something to a power that fits your table this is why I gave it to you this way what are you going to do with this subtract or add multiply or divide you're basically then doing a derivative so instead of multiplying and then subtracting you are adding and then dividing so on our answer here you're going to have x to the what five yes that's right you add one you and then divide by what is it weite X sure yeah in fact I think your book often writes it as 1/5 X you know it's the same thing though right x 5/ 5 or 1/ X and then don't you forget that plus C oh let's try this one notice how I have to always write my DX right if you don't have that it's not a good way to write an integral you're missing something does that fit your table yeah not quite here's what you can't what you can't do you can't do this you can't go oh not so much oh yeah now you're right no problem now yeah could you break the quotient rule by just doing the D to the top D to the top D of the bottom you can't do that you can't do you had a quotient rule for that right well now we don't have things like the quotient rule but note this is what I said to you earlier it must fit your table precisely I don't have anything in my table one nothing there's nothing one over that is there make it a make it X to the3 that would fit my table this new no oh dear this is true yes make it fit your table that's what you got to do so x to the -3 hey now we have X some power now we can do it just be careful when I say add I do mean add I don't mean get X to the4 because that would be subtracting right if we're adding to that you're going to x to the -2 very good over what over2 that's what you're getting over2 yes of course because you take it over your new exponent -2 + C you might make this a little bit prettier you can do -2 you could do uh 1 over 2x^2 plus C which is probably the most appropriate way to write that do you see that this goes down that stays there negative goes up you okay with this so far any one of those would be acceptable this is most acceptable yeah now by the way could you check your work hey what checks your work duh I mean yeah you should never get the wrong answer you can always check your work unless you do it really hard over the rules but most of the time you can check your work right all the time you can just gets more difficult but here with these easy ones man you shouldn't ever get one wrong shouldn't ever get one wrong somehow some of you Willow we will find a way okay is that in your table make it fit your table what do you do so we got it x to the 1/2 what do you do with the exponent you add or subtract with integrals you add so we're going to get what's 1 +2 is it one it's three so x to the 3 over this is why I do the over so you can really see this over 3 right over 3 you got me that's x 3 1 / 3 if you I'm I'm never do this again but you can see it this way x^ 3 over 1 over 3es reciprocate and multiply what you end up getting is 2 X 3 over 3 I ran it a room sorry plus C you notice a couple things about this firstly did I put the plus C right when I did the problem not really we only need the very end just the very end you can ignore it as long as you don't forget about it all together put the very end also could you check this with the derivative let's see derivative says you multiply by that hey there goes the 2/3 subtract one from it there here's the 1/2 the C's gone because C is a constant right derivative of a constant is zero that's the correct answer that's what we need to be getting ready for one more I'm not supposed to do this one I'm good mhm what do you do first yes now play along when you do this you get I'm going to do every step for you you get x to the -1 + 1 over1 + 1 right you get x to the 0 over 0 you get 1 oh crap you get oh crap why why why crap you can't so when you see this can you actually do it this right here is something out of the out of the realm of this class we we do late transcendentals we do uh functions like this later in 4B which you're you're going to get this I'll give you a little hint U what this gives you is actually the integral of this is actually lnx that's the integral of 1 /x so when you see this when you see one overx you can't do it in this class right you're not going to be able to do it here I just want you to see it that yeah that power rule only works if your exponent is not ne1 if it is negative 1 you divide by a new exponent that is zero and you can't do that so this one's off the table for us we can't do that one this one if you really want to know this is can't do that you're familiar with Ln right natural laog l x let's cover a couple properties before we go any further and then we start just practicing some of these things getting more and more used to taking an integral finding those anti-derivatives uh the properties you're going to find out are very very similar to the properties of derivatives I'm just going to State them for you you'll see them uh because they're exactly the same as derivatives oh yeah that makes sense first one is if you take so properties if you take and have an integral of a constant time some function that has an X in it what do you think you can do with that constant we can and typically you see this a lot more with integrals with derivatives we didn't really do that remember we said we could but we ended up just multiplying with with integrals you really do you do it a lot you can take a constant outside of your integral just like you could with a derivative possible yes I'm going to put two and three together here's two and three two and three say let's suppose that you had two functions being added together within your integral like that with derivatives we could separate those couldn't we we take the derivative of the first one plus the the derivative of the second that means here that works as well you get the integral of the first one plus the integral of the second what we couldn't split up was that right we still can't we still can't do that so you can't split up two integrals like that either it's very much like der because you're going backwards from a derivative so you can't do that either but this you can and this you this is two and three this says you can take the integral of f ofx DX plus with plus minus for minus G says I can take the integral piece by piece basically that's what that says this one is not true not still okay let me caution you about the C's you know we have to have plus C's right let me caution you on on how to do the C's I I think I mentioned this just like 20 seconds ago but I want to make sure you see an example let me give you a real quick example on this um if you had the integral of let's just do 2x no that two is a constant two I should be able to pull out in front of my integral and I can so this would be 2 * the integral of x remember how I said your integral has to fit your integration table this does what's the integral of x oh dear are we doing deres think think think x two is correct yes oh my gosh I eras the integration table you all forget start bra I did two two 2 2 x^2 / 2 + C does that make sense to you you have the two you have the x^2 over 2 plus C now for those of you who have written it like this for those people who think oh I need the plus C immediately well that gets confusing because what are you supposed to do do this if you do that what do you get what do you really get you get x2 right you get x s plus plus 2 C however what is plus 2 C two two two times a what two * which gives you another Conant so does it matter there 2 C no just C that's why I said there there's you have options you can put the plus C immediately and be careful on it or really just ignore it and put at the very end of your problem can you do that for me here's another example about why this is kind of useful I'll give you one more integral of 1 + x DX can I split split that up this that's the integral of 1 DX plus the integral of x DX here's what I mean about the C's just watch just watch okay watch for a second you write down later the integral of 1 DX is X true if you said oh x + C you have to call it C1 cuz it's going to be another constant plus this is x^2 over 2 yes we just did that plus C2 but then when you add them together you get x + C1 + x^2 / 2 + C2 and you get x + x^2 / 2 + C1 + C2 by re reuting those things follow that how much is C1 plus C2 it's constant plus constant it's another constant who cares what it is it's going to be a constant does that make sense so here ignore the C1 and the C2 that's too hard to deal with so basically you'd have x + x^2 / 2 + just C it's just going to be a constant there you're not adding together different cing go oh crazy it stands for any constant so any constant could be C1 plus C2 but who cares integrals you have to line up you just always end it with plus C you going to have one plus C at the very end of your problem that's for indefinite integrals no matter what now one last thing you remember how it derivatives when I said I want you to take the derivative of two 2x 2 don't write this down just watch - 4x + 3 you didn't split that up did you no you did 4x - 4 and then zeros for derivatives you can do the same thing with integrals so here could you split it up yes you can but you could you get directly from here to here sure you can what's the integral of one what's the integral of x x 2 where's the C coming from you need a plus c that's the same thing I'm just saying that this is possible just like deres this is possible therefore you can go directly from here to here you with me on that what you can't do is this again you can't break the multiplication thing you can't do integral of this times integral that that doesn't work so when you have functions of X multiply together like this one is there a special for that no yeah kind of you can go direct to there to there but something like this what you could not do you can't take the integral of this thing times the integral of that thing that doesn't work doesn't work at all what could you do distri distri you could distribute that would save all your problems right now you couldn't do that with that all right you can't do that that wouldn't be possible but I'm going to show you ways that on certain certain cases like this one I will show you how to do that particular example all right some integrals are going to be off limits for us in this class you get that 4B uh but a lot of them we're going be able to do but they must absolutely with all else with everything else failing fit your integration table they have to do that so whether you need to distribute uh whether you need to do something else with it make it figure table somehow that's the only way this stuff works still okay shall we try a couple more and then call it a day so that one we can't do [Applause] yet integral of 4 cosine X DX let's see what do you do with the four constants we often do that we really do we say this is four * the integral of cosine X DX that makes it fit our table that's easier to recognize just don't forget about the four you got the four the four is going to be there being multiplied by whatever you get next what do we get next what's the integral of cosine think about before you answer what's the integral of cosine X DX negative or positive it should you should answer this way when you take a derivative of it does it give you positive cosine X because that's what you're looking for was it sinx or negative sinx positive sinx remember you can always check your work no sense in getting the wrong answer here the derivative of sinx is cosine positive cosine that works that's what you want to get out of that okay if you ever see parentheses around that it doesn't really mean anything special it just means you're taking the integral of the entire thing all right so this this basically means the same thing as what I've been writing as this those parentheses just say everything's included in that do you see the difference there there's really no it's just grouping it it's just saying this integral entire thing it's not making anything special no special multiplication or whatnot can you take the integral of x do that now on your own take the integral of x write that out just do you don't have to say it just write it out integral of x is one true or false false what is it you can write 12 x^2 or you can do x^2 over two plus because we have a plus say we can separate them by addition that means we can just do them piece by piece if they're being added or subtracted not multiply divided but added subtracted integral of X2 what's that I'm going to assume your mumblings were X Cub over 3 I think some of you said that actually and then what no two C's just plus C that's that's all we want that's pretty much it how people understand the basic idea of integrals we're in practice a whole lot more of this I'll show you things we can and can't do next time all right so we're still doing some integrals our anti- differentiation going backwards from a derivative backwards of what a derivative is so let's go ahead and talk about that problem that's what we're going to start off should get our brains a little motivated when it says an integral that means find the anti-derivative of whatever function in terms of this variable that I give you so this says with respect to X so our function has to be in terms of X that's what we're integrating with respect to so when we have 2X 5 - 3x^2 + 4x - 8 do I have to necessarily split that up term by term or can I just find the integral of each little piece with addition subtraction each little piece is fine with multiplication division each little piece is not fine we knew that integrals just like derivatives were separable by addition and subtraction what that says is it allows you to do the integral of this piece minus the integral of this piece plus the integral of this piece minus integral of this piece and then jam it all back together you follow me on that let's go ahead let's take this integral what's the integral of 2x to the 5th can you tell me x 10 10 oh no not quite okay is the two still going to be there well you're going to reduce it out okay but is it going to be there when we start let's do that this little piece that two is a constant right when we take an integral just like a derivative the constant doesn't do much in fact if you were to break this up you'd write your constant in front of your integral now we're a little beyond that we just do the integral as we did derivatives we look at it we do it piece by piece so we say this is a two no problem the X to the 5th what's the X to the 5th become x to the 4th or x to the 6th x y six yeah over what yes the new exponent is what you divide by so we're going to get 2x 6 over 6 before we start simplifying are you follow me on this so far again you know what it's probably useful to check check this with a derivative at some point if you took a derivative here notice you're going to get 2x 5th that's nice you can check that make sure you have these right minus let's do the next piece how about 3x^2 what's the integral rule of 3x^2 okay I like the way you said 3x 3r over three because I'm going to simplify in a in a moment I going to write out the integrals just like they are and then I'll simplify just just a bit we okay so far plus plus what very good you sound my like my little drones today 4x^2 over 2 that's good no emotion but at least you're right fantastic and then the minus 8 goes to zero right because all constants go to oh wait when do constants go to zero we're not doing derivatives we're going backwards of that so if a constant goes to zero in a derivative a constant goes with an X in an integral so this goes Min - 8 x and that's it right uhhuh over one I guess you could if you really wanted to we don't need to show the over one but we are missing something very crucial yeah plus C is important again what we're finding is a family of curves or I'm sorry a family of area curves basically from this this is a a family of all the curves such that when I take a derivative of it it'll give me that that's what we're talking about are you with me by the way if you take a derivative of this will it give you that certainly that's how we this in the first place that's why it's called the anti-derivative now we're going to simplify a little bit some of you already told me this is 1/3 x 6 or x 6 over 3 - x Cub + 2 x^ 2 - 8X plus C that's our that is our integral I show hands tell me if we okay with this example kind of a basic example right not not too bad I am going to show you some ones that you you do have to do some work to this one was nice because everything fit in our integration table right away there are going to be some cases where that is not true so we'll take would you like to see a couple of those examples okay I think I gave you one last time that I'm not going to give you again but I want to talk about it like that we're not going to go all the way through this but I want you to to look at it I I gave you an example similar to that before can I just take an integral of this and integral of this and multiply it together does that work no no it only works Separation by addition subtraction so if I gave you this problem what's the only way you have to do it right now dist distri distribute make it look like this and then you can do it does that make sense you get like X 4th minus uh 5x^2 + 6 at least I hope so I guess we can go all the way through it's not that hard but once you do you see the distribution there once you distribute then you can take integral it's it's fairly easy after that and that's what we're going to get you you okay on that one so even if it doesn't look exactly like this sometimes you can make it look like that by some distribution or some working with our fractions or manipulating some trick functions we'll see that on the next ones are there any questions on on this particular one you guys alive today out there yes okay you're freaking me out do you remember me telling you that with your integrals they absolutely must be exactly like on an integration table or otherwise you cannot do it that was not a lie okay that's a true statement so when I give you something like this is that right there on your integration table then you can't do it the way it is that means you have to manipulate it somehow so when we look at this what we're constantly trying to do is somehow figure way to make this fit something on an integration table that's the idea these fit because they're pols they're very easy to do with tri functions they got to match exactly well you can't even be missing a little piece we got to make them match up so when you're deal with things like this it's often nice to break them up and see if you can manipulate around those trigonometric identities that you know and love maybe not love but at least hopefully know so for instance let me let me give you a a method on how to do something some of these one method would be okay let's say I split this up as 1 / sinx time cosine X over sin x are we okay on that one do you see it's legal to do that's still cosine X over sin^2 X right now why am I'm doing this well firstly because I'm pretty good at it right I know what this is going to be but secondly because I'm trying to get some other identity because I know right now cosine X over sin^2 X that over you see the over that's nowhere to be found in your integration table is there there's no over there's no fraction on your integration table anywhere right but what there is is when you have something over sign and something over sign you can often times translate those into some other trig identities that might be on your integration table so if you see an over that's not a good thing for you right now okay if you see an over right now and later on I'll show you some other ways to to go about doing this method one is well manipulate into something you can work with if you have something over sign over sign translate that back into a different trig function and then see what you have what is one over sign that's cosecant times not tan I'm pretty sure I gave you a nice one if you haven't memorized that that uh integration table which I'm guessing you probably haven't in one day uh why don't you take out your notes and look at it find the integral of cosecant Cent cosecant xent X I want you to find it get it in at least read it on your own find it reading something like that reinforces the idea even more besides just hearing it from somebody so I want you to find it look at it and identify that they're right I wrote them on the board they're on the video and they're also in your book did you all find it okay so cose cang I give you a nice one because that's actually in there if it wasn't you wouldn't be able to do it it has to be there it has to so that means you're going to manipulate these around until you find something that's exactly in your table which I guess is kind of a nice thing isn't it if it's not there you can't do it sometimes making it get there is fairly hard though so this one you said negative cosecant X yes plus very good feel okay with that one let's take a look at one more that I want you to see now it looks kind of nasty but firstly before you go any further can you tell me something that is wrong with that integral right now respect to say that louder for me it's with respect to X but the variable T do you see the discrepancy if I'm asking you to take an integral with respect to T oh sorry with respect to X my my variables have to be X if my variables are T that needs to be a t if it's not then you can't do it the way this is right you have to have that in the same variable so that's correct that's fine don't forget your DT that that's important now oh OMG is that in my integration table Heavens no no we don't have anything over anything in our integration table so this can't possibly be now one more question can I take the integral of this the integral of this and integral of that does that work no is there a quotient rule for integration no make it fit make it fit in your integration table so manipulate this somehow someone on the right hand side of the room give me an idea about how I can manipulate this to make it look maybe better say what okay I can't quite just move that up there whenever I want to because it's being subtracted but you're on the right track I like the thought can you factor stuff out Factor stuff what do you mean Factor stuff out bre will you say that again break it apart when you when you deal with things sometimes it's often nice occasionally to be able to do this to it right which is a true statement notice that if I do that and this is a very big hint when whenever you have one term on the denominator that's possible Right two terms not possible but one term you can always do that do you see what I'm talking about if you break up each individual numerator term over the denominator Factor you get all these different fractions Each of which will be simplifi each of one so yeah absolutely correct let's make this I'll show you every step here let's make this t^2 over T 4th - 2 T 4 over T 4 and there's still a DT by the way don't o try not to overthink these things do the simplest thing that will work not the hardest thing do the simplest thing that will work that's the simplest thing that's going to work why is that the simplest thing that's going to work I don't know you tell me can you simplify each of those fractions absolutely and they're not going to have any denominators anymore so when I have t^2 over T 4 well I know that we subtract exponents when I divide like like bases so that's going to give you t^2 or t to the -2 minus how about the last one what was it oh that's great I love that does this look a whole lot better than that one yeah for sure because this fits our table and that's what we needed to do so let's do the integral of 2 sorry t-2 minus 2 do it on your own see what you get out of that okay for [Music] I'm putting a dot dot dot because I'm going add more to that question after we solved the first part uh before we get there let's look at at this part uh we're going to do the integral of T2 - 2 well hopefully you got T the is it3 or 1 you're adding one to it -2 + 1 is 1 over1 did you make it that far minus what 2 2 T 2 T cool maybe plus C at the end now you can pull off the plus C until the very last step if you want to as long as you have the plus C we found out that plus C that's a constant doesn't matter where you have it as long as you have it at the end it's just a constant now I will make this a little prettier I'm going to move that exponent to the denominator that'll be -1 over t - 2T + C we have negative variables we should the end down negative xox yeah typically yes are there cases where you don't yeah there are but typically yeah would you if you got that one good for you fantastic integrals versus derivatives so far easier or harder harder harder hard you'll get used to it now let's look at the next question find the equation of a well you better used to it ha uh find the equation of a curve such that the slope of this point is x s let's think about what this means find the equation of a curve such that the slope at each point the slope at each point is x s what gives you the slope of an equation so basically it asks this give me an equation so that when I take a derivative of it the derivative is X2 do you got me that's basically asking for the anti-derivative that's what this question asks says give me an equation so that when I take a derivative of it when I get the slope at any point that's a derivative that's going to give me X2 so this question says okay here's what you know the slope at each point recognize that's a derivative right the derivative means a slope at any point that is dydx the slope equals X2 true the slope = x^2 how do you undo that well how do I find the equation that's going to give me that take an integral of X2 DX you're going to notice some weird things and this is this is kind of the way it works it's interesting I I can show it to you a little bit later where all these symbols come from but do you notice something this is weird but you know something about this if I treat this like a variable and I multiply I get d y = x^2 DX do you see where the DX is interesting huh if I want to undo a derivative an integral undoes that an integral undoes that on both sides integral of Dy is y aha look at that that's 1 Dy right with respect to Y 1 Dy with respect to Y will give you y does that make sense to you did I lose you yeah do you remember I lost you yeah what was this no no what was this clearly with respect to Y it is 1 equals the integral of x^2 DX which is exactly what we have right there that's very interesting it says undoing a derivative gives you an integral crazy crazy very cool anyway that was a side note Beyond a little bit of our the realm but it's interesting how that works right cuz some of you were asking where's the DX or maybe thought where's the DX from coming from why do we have that it's from doing that doing this idea undoing a derivative says well you work it this way integral of 1 Dy that's y take integral of both sides you get integral X2 DX oky dokie that works cool okay now back on to this did you need that did you want me write that back for you you have it right hey it's on video you can watch it again what is the integral of X2 DX so you saying that that's the equation right that's the what does that represent right there the family the family of curves or function the family of functions I guess function family so that when I I take a derivative of that it's going to give me X squ is that true for sure any constant now can I be specific can I give the equation in this terminology can I do that with this problem right now no not right now not right now because I haven't been specific on the C but if I change the problem just slightly and here's what I'm going to add on to it I'm going to say let's find the equation of the curve such that the slope at each point is x s and that's why I add the dot dot dot given that it passes through the point 21 given that it passes through 21 you know what it doesn't make it any harder it really doesn't what this says what this says right here is this family all the X Cub families you can think of right says any of them that are shifted up and down along the Y AIS do you notice that there's no other X's this is just X cubes shifted up and down the the y axis so where your your Y intercept is different what we're saying is now ah choose a specific one and now tell me what it is so the way to go about this is you say all right well I know for a fact what we just found out is that y = x Cub over 3 plus C not e c right that's what we have hey do you have an X do you have a y plug them in you're going to be able to find c that gives you a specific equation not a family but a specific equation so when I plug in my one for y my 2 for x let's just solve for C If I subtract 8/3 from both sides what do we get Negative 53 something like that yes no so when I do that I get C = -53 can you see that down there how do I finish out the problem well it it's not that hard it's you now know what c is right here we were stuck without a c so if I want to finish this off I go back up to here I say all right I know the equation so that when I take the derivative of it it gives me X2 when that happens and it goes through this point it's y = XB over 3 and then what that's right let's verify that for a second is this going to go through the point 21 sure that's how we found C when I take a derivative of this does it give me X2 then this is the only equation so that when I find the slope at each point it's x s and goes through this that's that says it's not a family anymore we've narrowed it down to one of these graphs how many people feel okay with that one that's the idea this is very similar to what's called initial value problem that we're going to study right now uh we're going to talk about differential equations just an introductory not anything too drastic they have a whole class on differential equations right I'm giving you like you know when you get a new thing ice cream and you open the lid and you get the ice cream on the top you're like oh I better get that stuff cuz it melt real quick you know that the ice cream is differential equations I'm giving you the stuff off the top that's it that's the the skim tasting of ice cream has really sweet but uh you get more of the good stuff in the actual class okay turns bitter it turn bitter it's fine dep on what kind of ice cream you're talking about consider are fine you had garlic flavored ice cream it's actually pretty good it's not like that it's an acquired taste yeah so don't go home and say oh I learned all about differential equations no you didn't all right this this is just a little little teeny bit of it but the idea is is there uh and we're start with a basic idea let's pretend for a second and this this was basically it I'm just kind of going to illustrate a little bit more let's pretend that I have a derivative that I know like that the idea is this it's it's basically the same thing we were doing here it's can you find a function an anti-derivative so that the derivative gives you this it's the idea is um you know what may be right a different way don't think I need that that'll make it easier for us the idea is basically the same thing if you know the derivative IS F ofx can you find an anti-derivative basically a function so that when I take the derivative of it it gives me our original function back again that's the idea it's essentially the same as this let me show you how this works with what's called an initial Val problem after we do one basic basic example let's say that Dy DX = x 4 can you tell me what y equals if the Dy DX = x 4 can you tell me what y equals that's what it would be it's the same it's the same question here do you see how it's the same question it's interesting it same thing I asked you here find me an equation so that the slope is this that's what it says find me an equation so that the derivative is this instead of slope I now have the word derivative but it's same idea because slope is a derivative so here it says well I know that Y is going to be the integral of x to 4th DX if you want that proof again here's the proof again well not even a proof but here's a manipulation of these variable Parts if I separate them I get Dy = x 4 DX yes to find y I have to undo a derivative on both sides undoing a derivative is called an integral the integral of 1 dy I can put a one anywhere that I want to the integral of 1 d y is y the integral of x to 4 DX is exactly what I have here and that's why we're we're coming up with this that's how you find anti-derivative that's that's that does that make sense to you can you follow that have i blown your mind like a mind grenade are you with it yeah all right and Joe is Right X 5th over 5 or 1 x 5th plus C over to plus C so what's a solution to a differential equation it's actually not one it's Solutions differential equations just like we have solutions for a family of Curves before I put this little piece into it the reason why I gave you this first is because this problem is this problem is a differential of equation it's as the same concept this right here is a differential equation that's a family of Curves you got it this right here would be an initial value condition and that's what I'm going to introduced to you over here in the terms of differential equations so both questions are the same give me the slope give me the derivative I'm sorry sorry give me the slope of uh if the slope is this find me a function so that the slope is what I've given you find me a function so that the derivative is what I've given you it's the same exact question then I can add pieces on to it here's a condition that lets you solve for C I'm going to give you an initial value problem that let you solve for C would you like to see one of those totally that was funny I'll leave that this is basically when you only need one solution based on some initial condition so this is the family of solutions right here we're going to say well we only need one of them we need something to fit a specific purpose and that's what we're going to do here so basically here's an example if you have dydx = 1 2x to the quantity Cub an initial condition looks like this it says why of some initial x value equals some initial y value that's what that says and here's what I'm going to give you this looks pretty complicated but here's what it says in in real life it'll give you like something y of one is zero that's what it would be can you tell me what is your x coordinate here what's your X the zero or the one the one the Y would be the zero this says when you plug in one you get out zero does that make sense to you that's what that says so can you first undo the derivative secondly can you use this to solve for C that's the two parts of our problem so firstly can you do that for me can you do that go for it if the derivative of y is 1 / 2x 3r we need to undo that derivative that's the integral that's the anti-derivative idea so what we want is to undo this thing Tell Me Maybe the first thing that you would do make itable make it fit the table to the top you could you'd have to be very careful with that I'll show you both ways here okay be very careful on how you handle this option one is bring the bottom to the top right now right right okay yes that's right if you do this you can't take the integral yet you cannot do it what you would have to do is split that off but you're going to get not 2 to the 3 23r over x to the I'm sorry times x3r DX do you see that how it doesn't go to eight that's actually 1/8 do you see what I'm talking about it's not8 it's 1/8 so be careful on that you get 18 x to the3 that you have to leave because that does fit your table what can you do with the 1/8 probably a good idea to do right we don't want to mess around with fractions too much because we create more fractions it's easier if I write this as 1/8 X3 DX what is the integral of x to the -3 DX can you tell me X good out of line okay well that is -1 over 16 x^2 do you see the1 over 16x2 out of that can you make it that far that's our our algebra coming back at us we're going to move our xon it down -2 * 8 is -16 but I'm going to put the negative on the top makeing that netive 1 and then and say it again very good you'll find maybe the better way than moving that up to the top maybe a little bit easier to see would you like to see that one different option here since you can't really do anything fancy yet you don't know how to deal with parentheses at all do you there's been no such thing as parenthesis maybe deal with that first and go oh well this is 1 over8 X Cub yes you follow then does the eight move to the top no it's just X the 3 that's the integral of 1/8 * X3 and that gets you right to that step can you follow that one as well so either way you want to do that I really don't care but sometimes it's easier deal with those parentheses first off before you start moving all these pieces around because you have to end up moving it back down to the denominator anyway in either case though we're going to get -1 over 16x2 + C tell me what I found what is it it is an integral yes it is an inte family a family of what functions functions Works family functions that does what for us what does this family functions do solve your initial what do you mean solve for someone over here tell me what what H what does this family function said wrong Weir functions represent for us come on help me out we've we've had two ways to represent this way number one was what's a integral or an anti-derivative represent represents areas we could consider that as an area because that's an integral yes in this context this one this is a family of Curves such that when I take a derivative of it it gives me that exact thing do you follow that's what we're represent a family of Curves how we find one specific curve or one specific function is we use the initial value now this is basically the same idea as me giving you a point before only I'm not giving you a point explicitly I'm giving you a point right here like this I'm saying I'm not saying what x is but you should know what x is what is X here and Y is Zer it says y y of one is zero so what am I going to plug in well let's see it says the initial value for y the initial value for y is zero the initial value for x is one plus C that lets you solve for C in our case we'll have 0 = -116 this is kind of nice and easy in this particular case you add 116 and you get 116th equal C substitute that back in and the exact equation that we're looking for to satisfy not only the differential equation but the initial value is this by show hand some we feel okay with that one so far let's try one more just to make sure you really grasp this I'll show you an example of uh how you can do it in actually real life uh how this stuff works for you and then we'll be done for the day so last one let's say Dy DX is cosine X initial value is y of 0 equal 1 this one's going to be nice and quick for us we know quick through it um if Dy DX equal cosine X Y has to equal the integral of cine X DX we we know that we know that that is going to undo that derivative so hey can you tell me what's the integral of cosine think about it before you answer I don't want anybody to answer in the first two seconds of what you think uh think of the integral of cosine X what is it ah sign or negative posi plus C the plus C is important right hey if you forget the plus C that initial value is meaningless isn't it you got to have that plus C to solve for something so you had to have that do you see why it's sign by the way take a derivative of sign you're going to get cosine now we plug some numbers in uh what do we plug in for the Y in this case that's my initial value is y0 or is y one which one y of zer gives you one the other zero that's your X this would be like y of X that's why why I had it right here y of xal Y sub Z so our X is zero our Y is one how much is sign of zero oh boy some of you are killing me today how much is sign of zero it's definitely zero yeah 1 equals c no you you guys are right 1 equals c so our function that we were looking for is sin of x + 1 is it true that the derivative of this is going to still give you cosine X is it true that it goes with that initial value absolutely being the x is zero that means that y it would be the Y intercept so whenever we have the Y intercept would C always come out to be the same should it should yes yeah absolutely because you're plugging in zero for X it's got to be on that Y axis special case I suppose it's kind of nice when you think about it when you do an integral right you're always going to have something in terms of X or whatever your variable is plus some C which does not have your variable so that naturally if you're plugging in zeroes everything else go away except for that would you like to see a real life example are any of you in physics are any of you going to take physics oh good do you know that you can do catapults yes do a catapult example this for that Reas it's the main reason to take physics build the catap that's what I would take it I hate physics I mean I loved it I [Laughter] love my teacher was not very good not like the teachers we have here they're good here is that so catapult you know they're originally intended to shoot cats that's why it's called a catapult just kidding but that would be pretty fun I don't like cats especially when you don't like there's no cat I like now let's say you really suck at building a catapult and you shoot it accidentally straight up in the air right above your head is that a good thing no not with the Catapult possible it's possible seen it happen with a really badly built catapult straight up in there so let's say it accidentally shoots straight up in the air with an initial velocity of 128 ft per second I want to do a few things I want to find the position function of this for the projectile basically for the height I want to know what the maximum height is and I want to know when it's going to hit you in the head actually when it hits the ground so hit your foot when will it land on your foot when's it going to hit the go oh let's say one more thing about this uh let's say that it actually shoots straight up with an initial velocity of 128 fet per second and you're launching it off of a 16t platform so you're up 16 ft and then you launch it so maybe not straight up but just slightly over so it's going to land on the ground okay does that make sense to you or you move the platform real quick or maybe your catapult is 16 feet high so when it starts throwing it it's at 16 ft so maybe that the top of it launches it straight up something breaks I don't know you mess it up but it launches straight up from your huge catapult and it's going up there and you're like oh crap it's going to hit me and so you just watch it and you count let's see when it's going to hit you that's the the idea here cuz we would all do that naturally um let's talk about a few things that we should know firstly let's call our position function s that's typical for a position function so s of T according to time the initial height what is the height of this thing at tal 0 right when you launch so s of Z is 16 do you follow me on that 16t so right when it's launching is at 16 ft High because that's when it's letting go what's the velocity uhuh yeah it's exactly right going positive second now here's a good question for you what is velocity in relation to a position function it's the what the what velocity is the first do you remember that's the first r so velocity is the first derivative of a position position function and it said initial velocity so the initial velocity would be this the first derivative at Time Zero because what's going to happen to your projectile is it going to stay at 128 ft per second forever no no probably not cuz it's going out of space it's going to slow down immediately after you launch it out of a catapult right gravity is going to affect it we're not going to do wind resistance but gravity is going to affect it it's going to come up and then it's going to come down true so the initial velocity at Time Zero is 128 ft per second I don't know if I spelled that right probably SP it wrong not get it spell I think I have too many L's do I yeah acceleration there we go if you have acceleration like that uh what's acceleration I didn't say anything about acceleration but think outside the box here or actually think outside this globe accelerating at 9 now very good he did you hear what he said so it's going to be de accelerating decelerating it's still form of acceleration it's just in the reverse Direction so you're going to be accelerating negatively cuz he's pulling it towards the ground and he said 9.8 m/s squ which is true but I'm talking about feet oh so not 9.8 do you know 32 yes accelerate now oh wait another interesting question what's acceleration as it relates to a position curve do you remember all this rates of change position function was a position the first derivative gave you velocity the second derivative gave you acceleration so here's what we know we know the second derivative actually that's going to be a constant the second derivative is 32 ft/s squared Why is it a constant well gravity of change for us so it's going to be pulling down a constant acceleration of -32 ft per squ we will feel okay with our setup here I'm going to show you what to do with this next time we'll start here we're going to continue talking about our catapult problem and here's what we knew so far we're launching from a catapult and as the projectile leaves the arm reaches up and reaches a maximum height of 16 ft and then let's go and this thing shoots straight up in the air because you built it wrong it's going to have fine on the ground right in front of you got it it leaves the Catapult with an initial velocity of 128 ft per second now what's going to happen as soon as it leaves the Catapult what happens to that projectile de acceleration it starts slowing down that's right the velocity starts slowing down because gravity is affecting it now what our goals here are to do is find the position function that's position according to Time find the maximum height we can do that we already know how to find maximum and minimum and we're going to find out when the projectile will hit the ground these two this is going to be based off our position function the maximum height we're probably going to have our first derivative for that you with me on this so what we what we we know initially with our problem well we know that it's starting out at 16 ft so I said it starts from height of 16 ft that's because our catapult arm reaches a height of 16 ft and then let's go so the position at time equals zero isn't zero it's 16 it's like a it'd be like a pitcher throwing a ball if a pitcher throws a ball the ball doesn't start from zero right he's not going to go that'd be the worst pitcher ever he's going to throw it from up here right it starts from like 8 ft and then goes up it's not going to start from the ground same thing with our CLE so the position at 0 is 16 ft the first derivative gives us velocity so our initial velocity is 128 ft per second that means that our initial velocity at zero that that's where we start right here the velocity at zero has to be 128 ft per second right when it's leaving it's traveling at 128 ft per second straight up are you guys okay with that all right now acceleration how we came with acceleration isn't Magic it's just something to do with the Earth's gravity it says that acceleration - 32 ft/s squared means that gravity's pull on everything with that acceleration if you drop something from here it's it's going to momentarily be at a velocity of zero right right when I drop it and then gravity is going to take its effect and start moving and speed up and speed up and speed up and speed up until it hits the ground you follow me and that acceleration that's acting on is a constant -32 ft perss squared that means that the velocity changes at 32 ft per second every second so drops it's after 1 second will be at 30 per second then further and further and further and further and further so do you see where we're getting all these numbers from now the interesting thing is using just this information we're going to actually be able to work backwards and get all the stuff that we want to find so let's try to work on that first thing right now what we know is basically we only know the second derivative notice how this is S Prime of 0 and of Z we don't have a position function we just know something about the position of zero we don't have a velocity function we just know something about the velocity at zero at time equals zero are you with me on this what we do know is the acceleration function that's all we know as a matter of fact so if we know that we've got the second derivative the acceleration function in terms of t can you explain to me how I could get maybe somewhere else besides that not taking a derivative because that would give me a third derivative I don't want that but is there a way I can get from here to maybe one derivative higher if we integrate the second derivative it must give us the first derivative does that make sense well it's kind of interesting concept and that's going to work for us so here's what we know S Prime of T is going to be the integral of S Prime of t T the first derivative is the integral of the second derivative and of course you need a DT are you okay with that one all right now why are we doing this again well we don't have the Velocity function we just have the Velocity at zero so this is actually going to help us remember the initial value problems that we did earlier this is basically what that is so this says all right my first derivative is going to be the integral of whatever my second derivative was in this case it's just -32 well that's a pretty easy one what's the integral of -32 DT can you tell me that2 T why not X our it says T might as well use T 32t wait and and you said what plus is a c important yes okay you know a student asked you today why is the C why do you even need the C and the the answer is well if you take a derivative let's say this and this and this you don't have to write this down just kind of watch if you took a derivative of all these things what's the derivative here what's the derivative here what's the derivative here now if you take the integral of each one of the these are all the same right if you take the integral of all these things you're still you're going to get this right is it necessarily this one no I know that all three of these came from three different sources so I can't take the integral of this and get one thing back again it has to represent all of them how we represent all of them is there could be a constant over there that's where the plus C is coming from that's why we have that so anyway we certainly do need the plus C here so good catch on that now tell me something I can do someone on the right hand side of the room since we have S Prime of t = 32t plus C tell me what I can do now initial velocity okay so initial velocity hey I have that it says Sime of 0 equal 128 where does the zero go where's the zero go that that stands for T right so S Prime of t or Sime of 0 says I know the first derivative equal 128 when the t equal Z does that make sense to you are you sure S Prime 0 equal 128 right so S Prime of 0 the 0 meant the T the 128 was the velocity at zero this means the velocity this means a velocity at zero that's 128 can you solve for C that one's really nice how much is C so with a little substitution we have the S Prime of T is -32 t + 128 appre feel okay with that so far we now have a velocity function says velocity at any time T now here's something interesting which question can we answer right now the first one the second one and the third one can we answer the position function yet we don't have that on the board can we answer the maximum height yet kind of almost almost we can get close to this one we'll talk about that in a minute but we're very close to this why where would a maximum occur when the slope is zero do we have a formula for the slope yes we do it's right there that's the slope right so when the think about that oh I broke my pen state no I just recap last time when the Catapult goes up and it stops that would be where the velocity would equal zero right then it's going start moving negatively so right where the velocity equals zero is where we should have maximum or in other words where the slope of the tangent line the is zero it's going to reach its peak and come back down so that's going to be what we're going to be using in just a bit now before we can actually find the maximum height though because we're going to have to plug that number in we need to figure out the position function right after that so let's go ahead and do that next part if we know S Prime of T is there a way you can figure out s of T our same our same basic idea s of T equals the integral S Prime of T and integral will undo that derivative so in order to go from our first derivative back to a position function let's just take an integral look so that's how we write it this would said take the integral of the first derivative of your position function this is the first derivative of your position function I substitute that back in I'm going to take an integral of this can you'all help me what's the integral of -32 T what would you do 12 okay I'm going to do this a little bit longer but yeah you guys are right I'm going to do -32 t^2 over 2 just so people can see where that's coming from I'm taking integral I'm adding one to the exponent dividing by the new exponent plus don't forget about the 128 that doesn't go to zero this is not a derivative it's integral so 128t plus C good plus C now of course you guys are right this is going to be -16 t^2 in fact if you've ever seen position functions for uh projectiles they always have that -16t ^2 in front of it why why gravity that's why it's not magic it's not magic someone actually did the work and said oh yeah yeah if we're accelerating downward 32 ft per second squared if I integrate that twice a position function that's going to be in my problem okay now tell me people on the left hand side of the room what would be the next step that I would do here solve for C good now back to your initial your initial function since we have that this is my position at zero my position at zero is 16 my position at zero says plug in zero to your T this is my position at zero and I knew that had to be equal to 16 it says if you plug in zero look at this what it says if you plug in zero it's got to be equal to 16 since I plugged in zero it must be equal to 16 you you okay with that how much just see clearly everything else goes zero so that means our position function is that should make sense says think about this diagnose this what's this from that part what's that from well what is it from though where does it stem from well I know it's integral but is it from the height is it from the velocity or is it from the gravity oh dear goodness where did thetive 16 come from is from integrating this twice right I sure hope so this part is from Gravity we just talked about that come on people some of you are zoning out right now stop zoning out you with me that's some gravity you integrate -32 you get 32t integrated again you get -32 t^2 over 2 that's -16 t s that's gravity what's this what's that come from ini that's your initial height in fact if you plug in time equals z you get 16 right so you start from 16 ft what's this from that has to do with your initial velocity when you start out what are you at so basically I'm shooting something off and then letting gravity take its effect on that that's what that says feel okay where that stuff is coming from at least now with any type of a projectile problem like this could you just dbe the answers your initial value is the same there's a definite pattern between the value your initial oh yeah absolutely all you need to know is your initial velocity uh gravity and your initial height and you can do basically the same thing with projecti functions now of course this doesn't take into account certain things this doesn't take into account wind resistance doesn't take into account like a propellant so you know how South Korea launched a rocket or North Korea sorry launched a Rocket yesterday and it went up and came down well we couldn't model that exactly right because of wind resistance because it probably didn't go straight up unless they're really just not very bright uh because from what I know you don't launch rockets straight up that would be stupid U but if they even if they did right we won't be able to model it great because if they have some sort of propellant that's launching it you have to take that into account how the propellant burning off things like of that nature this just basically says I'm launching letting go or maybe the rocket took off and then the moment it took off it just blasted real quick and but then it's not firing anymore that would be a different story this just has an initial velocity and we let gravity take its course as a difference there now we're almost done we have the first part we got this we know that this is equal to -16 T ^2 + 128t plus C in our case C was 16 okay part one done we can do part two and three at the same well not the same time but anytime that we want how would you do part two let's talk about that when would part two happen oh you set it to zero set what to zero not the position right no that would be a height the first derivative though gives us the velocity that says when it's zero it's going to be at its peak so if we set this equal to zero 32t = 128 what's t equal if you divide 128 by 32 exactly four I love it four what seconds cuz T is a Time second so what what's your maximum height is it four no no that's 4 seconds how would you figure out your maximum height here's what you know your maximum height occurs after 4 seconds so after 4 seconds you're at the maximum Point uh of your height and then you start dropping how would you figure out the maximum height plug it in where your position the position function yes that's why we had to figure out the position function first so that we could actually find the maximum height we could have found out when it is the maximum height very easily uh as soon as we had that we could have done it but to figure out the actual maximum height you got to have something to plug it into so maximum height occurs at 4 seconds can someone please plug that in for me into my position function and find out exactly how high we get 784 784 ft someone else double check that for me 784 ft please it's probably going to be a whole number yeah 7 so what this says is that your catapult you built is going to launch something from a height of 16 ft it's going to go to 784 ft that's after 4 seconds and start dropping Like a Rock when is it going to hit the ground acceleration zero acceleration is never zero it's a constant hey let me ask you this question uh what is the height when you hit the ground you'll understand the height when you if you fell on your face your face would be at zero when you hit the ground right right now my face is at six six feet and then it's going to go and I'm going to get zero feet off the ground does that make sense now which one of these represents your height is it the position the first derivative or the second derivative position your position so what this says is when does this equal what number zero when does it equal zero this is actually a math SE an intermediate algebra question we just did this today I just taught this in another class it says take this set it equal to zero solve for T that's going to give you a time in fact it's a quadratic right it's going to give you two times do you see the two times I'm talking about one will be positive one will be negative you're going to take those two times which one is going to make sense for this problem the positive T or the negative T oh some of you guys are not with me today what makes sense if you're going to hit the ground after some amount of time a negative time can you launch a catapult and it hits backwards in time that'd be pretty sweet I'm sure North Korea would have loved that I launched it and it hit them in the in the past they have won the Korean War they would have won yeah so that doesn't work so what we're talking about is in your quadratic when you do quadratic formula or whatever you want out of that thing uh you're going to set this equal to zero that's not right 74 is not right it's too you both give me that then I forgot two people it's 27 you didn't do 16 oh 272 I can't it's been driving 2 how do you calculus people make simple mistakes like that I'll never get it I don't understand we have good intentions letter come on you know what you match up with good intentions and bad follow through a bunch of crap bunch of crap you have all the good intentions of the world I intended to drive well when I was drunk perfectly did I ran over 37 people but fully intended to do well yeah okay D can just suck anyway okay so make a note on your paper I don't do the math I trust you guys I should never trust you guys apparently 272 ft instead of 784 make sure you have a negative my goodness coration this is ridiculous um any I'm not going to do the rest of that you I'm going to trust you to make your own mistakes on that one uh use a quadratic formula figure out the time one will be positive one will be negative the positive time works the negative time says you launch a catapult and and and it lands in the past that doesn't make any sense at all your positive time would be when it hits the ground but you feel okay with our example we got to move on all right 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 4.2:  Integration by Substitution
now after we do all this stuff any questions good since you've had the introduction to integrals we can now talk about some more advanced concepts it's a little bit better I think it's funner you might not think so at first but you will promise I'll brainwash you like North Korea looking forward to this my life follow [Applause] integration by substitution here's the point behind integration by substitution what you're doing is trying to make a difficult integral easier remember from what I first told you this was not a lie in order to do an integral it must fit in your integration table do you remember that it has to if it doesn't you cannot do it it's got to fit so what we try to do is either manipulate the inside of our integral somehow by Distributing or dividing remember like you did on your hopefully you started your homework you do manipulate trig functions do all that and make it fit somehow what this is called by the way is a u substitution we'll be using the letter U let me give you a for instance on why we have this and it's all about this problem write down that problem we'll talk about in a second um firstly ladies and gentlemen does that problem fit your integration table exactly like it is no I it's got some parentheses got some stuff being multiplied knowing what you know right now how would you do that sure and that it'd be fairly easy right it actually very easy how about that a little bit long you could right you could though still do you could foil it out three times and then distribute your 2X and you could do it there someone like that is that something you want to do only if you're crazy that's when you don't do the homework yeah that's when you go Mr Leonard you not you failed me you didn't teach me right there's got to be a better way and the better way is this does not fit your integration table for some of you who think this is possible it's not you can't distribute this in there okay you can't do that that's an exponent the only thing you would you have fall or operations right expon before multiplication you have to do all that I could teach you binomial expansion but you'd be at the 50th row of Pascal's triangle with some pretty easy stuff but still it would be it'd be longer than the sport before you were done okay it'd be crazy now we're going to learn something different called integration by substitution what it's going to allow us to do is Substitute part of our integral for the letter U thereby making a really hard integral really really easy you want to see how to do it of course because it makes your life easier I'm saving your I'm literally saving your life that would take you like a year it's going to take us two minutes see I've saved you however many minutes around a year minus two you're welcome here's your steps the first thing you're going to do is pick you so that integral is easier I know that's vague I know it's vague but I'll give you some notes on that you're trying to pick U so the integral is easier not harder sometimes you'll pick the wrong U it's okay you'll know it in 10 seconds or less seriously pick U so the integral is easier right yeah yes you can pick you so it becomes harder you don't want to do that but you'll know it it's you'll get stuck here's two big hints It's usually the it's usually get it you usually It's usually the inside of something it's usually the inside of something and here's a musthave the derivative is somewhere in the integral the derivative of your U is somewhere in your integral already okay disregarding constants the constants don't matter I'll teach you how to do stuff without constants but the derivative is far as the X's go must be an integral no I'm just going to leave it to you that confuses me it's got to be an integral somewhere also make a note this this does not include constants you don't really care so much about the constants disregard constants second step that's where all the work happens by the way Second Step third step fourth step very easy uh Second Step is we're going to transform our integral from X DX to UU so translate our X's to use our D DXs to duse remember how your D whatever has to that's your variable if I'm going to put some 's up there I can't have a DX anymore that's not going to happen I need to have a du so I'm going to teach you how to do that too transform something in terms of X DX to Something in terms of U du after that it will be in your integration table if it's not you have to do another substitution or something else or the integral is not possible using these methods there are some that are not possible and you can't do them or you can't do them with this integration by parts or a trig substitution it's got to be in a table there's things that we can't do in this class right when we we get to skim surface step three will be solve your integral so do integral and step four notice what's what's happened here I I know it's very vague because I haven't shown you an example but I need you to think through it okay with me you're picking u u is going to take the place of some X did you get that concept can take the place of some X therefore when you go from DX to Du we got that down then we're going to do our integral but you're still going to be in terms of U so you need to translate it back into terms of X does that make sense you got to end with whatever variable you start with so translate back to you I I think I said you I meant X translate back to X okay now for the good stuff I'll show you how to do this problem now what's the bad part in this integral what's the bad part is the 2x a bad part not really what's the bad part50 probably this part right that part now when you're doing a U substitution often times you don't pick the whole thing you pick the inside thing you cover it up and you go okay if I If This Were A U could I still take the integral and then here's what you do you go if this was a u can you take the integral of U to the 50th absolutely so don't take this as your integral take just I'm sorry as your you take just this little part here's why you take just that little part you're going to have to take a derivative of this you have to so you want something where you take a derivative and it doesn't completely Jack your problem up because you're going to to put it back in your integral here's what we're talking about I'm going to pick usually the inside and it has to be such that the derivative is in your integral somewhere so of this you can do the derivative of that right yeah take the derivative of that what is it 2 is 2x in your integral yeah it's going to work no it's going to work it's now if this was your U your derivative would be 50 x^2 + 1 49th power * 2x is that in your integral no that would be the wrong way to go here's why it has to be in your intergral you're going to see this in about 45 seconds U = X2 + 1 are you okay with the U we pick the inside of something also the derivative has to match up with something in your integral not necessarily constants even if the two look at even if the two wasn't there it would still be okay the constant doesn't matter that much now what you're going to need to do is take a derivative implicitly of both sides so if I take a derivative the derivative of U is Du the derivative of this side is what 2x 2X and DX by the way here's why if you want to know the why because it looks weird right now um most I guess most teachers don't show it this way but I'll show you if you took an integral with respect to x what you get is D DX = 2x right solve for du 2 that's where we get we do that every time so give you du and DX on different sides so you can work it like that if if that makes sense to you use that does it make sense to you that always made sense to me so in your case this is going to be du this is going to be 2x DX we feel okay with that so far now here's a cool part we can do this like a double substitution not only are we going to substitute this part for some U which we already are going to be able to do but you can also substitute your DX if you can solve for DX so can you solve this for DX yes how would you solve this for DX if I divide by 2x by the way I know I teach this different from some of you who have had calculus before I teach it a little different I think this works better uh because you can actually see the simplification happen in this problem okay are you still okay you sure so let me recap for a second I guess was more than 45 seconds but now you'll see why you had to have your derivative somewhere in your integral we look at this we find the part that sucks it's usually the inside of something the derivative has to be there take that as your U take a derivative of both sides you're going to get a du every time that's going to happen you're you never have anything weird like 2 U or 4 U you that doesn't happen you just take your derivative of U you get du take your derivative of this side you're going to get 2X and DX solve for DX raise your have you feel completely okay with this now you do the substitution instead of 2x + 1 what do I put do I still have to the 50th power yes yes this became my U to the 50th now check it out my 2x is there but what is my DX instead du du over what yes U 50th 2x DX you got it hey look at the two x's is one on numerator one on denominator this is basically like writing this it's basically like writing 1 over 2x du like that your 2 X's are gone gone integral of U to the 50th du notice how we have to have this is important this is why I make you guys write the D some people do integrals they don't write the DX they don't write the DU do you see why you have to have that it tells you what variable you're integrating with respect to so if you didn't change to Du and still at DX this is not possible you can't do it so we had to change that we had to write the DU now can you take the integral of U to the 50th everybody should be able to do this what is it perfect actually pretty easy and right now we're here we're here we translated we're right here you got to translate back into X you see we start with x's we're now in terms of U how much is your U it's on the paper right X just put x s + one back there x^2 + 1 in parentheses to the 50th power 51st power over 51 plus C that's your in does it actually work if you take a derivative we we probably do it in our head it's kind of a simple one you bring down the 51 gone to the 50th power times the derivative of inside because you're using a chain rule that gives you 2x that is the appropriate integral that's it is it art medium easy it's going to you have to understand it you have to really understand it one note that that you need on this you're going to notice that all of your X's must be gone before you can integrate do you see that you cannot integrate with both x's and U's it can't happen so all your X's must disappear before you integrate is that why the coent is no matter of the X yes coefficients you can pull out in front of your integral right you're going to see that some of the later examples this was a very very basic example but I wanted to get this so you can understood it so all of your X's must disappear and the only way you can do that is through the DU over your X's no oh is there other method yeah okay I don't how eliminated either's two L's or one L I don't like El's hence my name you name with two l i just say it Ard not forget the L Mr Mr Enard way better way better It's Tricky lv's swear you know sometimes this U substitution stuff is pretty obvious until you get to trig and then it becomes a little bit more cumbersome but stick with the idea that your derivative has to appear somewhere that you have to cross stuff out you have to get rid of things and then it helps you a lot so in this one hopefully we can kind of pick out the U Already can you pick out the U Already when all El fails if you're like oh my gosh I don't know just pick the inside pick the inside the whole the just the inside not the exponent the inside and try it once it hurt you to try you just take a derivative and see if you're right I mean it takes 10 15 seconds maybe tops and that's better than doing nothing so here I'm definitely not going to pick that that really doesn't make it better I want to pick this to make the inside go away right if I pick the inside it goes away I have U to the 5ifth that's a piece of cake also do you notice that the derivative of this is in your integral what's the derivative of this 2 no the Der is not 2X the derivative of this is what 3x2 ignore the three and say it again right there don't care about the the three but the x s has to be there so U = XB - 4 du = 3x^2 DX I want you to solve for DX solve for DX how do you solve for DX here divide by what okay so do that give me little head knot look up at the board here give me a head knot if you're okay on getting down to that far are you yes yes okay cool now it's time to do your substitution as soon as you choose your U and you do the derivative thing and you solve for DX you can substitute and see which you have is look up here is X still here yes I didn't substitute in for that is this still here what is this to the good that fifth is still there you never take that power oh my gosh that'd be ridiculous right because look your derivative is right here it have to show up in your integral in order for you to simplify it and then instead of DX I'm going to write do you see anything simplifies here what simplifies what about the three is a three on a numerator or denominator so here's what I'm going to do for you I'm going to say well that is a three it's basically 1/3 right what can you do with constants that's why constants don't matter that's why you disregard the constants because they really don't affect you in terms of X or U right it's just a number being multiplied so this is 1/3 I know you can take the integral of that that's U to 6 over 6 plus C we'll do one more step we're going to multiply those fractions together we're also going to in insert back in what our U is equal to that's x 3r minus 4 so our our final answer should be x 3r - 4 all to 6 power over 18 plus C are we red light yellow light green light are we green light on this stuff are we good to go are you sure are you okay on and seeing where your use coming from it's probably the most important part seeing that after that everything really falls into place as long as you follow these steps I've outlined for you you take your derivative you solve for DX that's not hard that's algebra you plug it in you cross some stuff out pull out any constants and then you'll have a very simple integral it has to be simple it has to fit in your table if it doesn't you either made a mistake or you can't do it and that's the the whole thing or you have to make a a double substitution which does happen um occasionally we might get to one let's keep rolling got some good stuff going on so far how about this now if I gave you that integral at the beginning of integrals like last section you'd be stuck right there's no way you're going about doing that because that does not fit in your integration table that's s of x to 4th that's times 2x Cub you can't separate integrals by multiplication you can't take the integral of this the integral of this and the integral of that and think you're going to be right it's not going to happen the only thing we have left to us is substitution that's all you get in this class you get either it somehow fits you have to make it fit or you get substitution that's it there's no other method that we have in 4 a in first semester calculs it's only two options you got so let's try to pick something for our you why don't you write down what you think as you don't say it out loud why don't you write down what you think would be a good you remember the two criteria it's usually inside of something not the whole thing but inside of something and the derivative must be there got to be there so question should I pick sign what's the derivative of sign do you see a then there's then sign's not the right choice how about 2x to the 3 is it inside of something not a good choice also the derivative is an X squ do I see an X squ anywhere up there that's my good choice just X to 4th did you pick X to 4th okay so put it off to the side you have to show your work be organ be organized trust me be organized with this cuz doing U integration by parts later in your next semester you're going to to be very organized with it otherwise you're you're going to lose stuff because any by Parts sometimes you integrate by Parts which is they'll teach you that then then you have to use substitution on both of them it's it gets crazy if you're not organized okay we have x to the 4th yall tell me what's the next step that we do okay do it hopefully you still remember how to take derivatives right that's why we had to cover derivatives before integrals for this stuff uh okay what's your next step after you do your derivative don't forget the cube that's going to be du over 4X Cub = DX still okay so far now you substitute for whatever you've picked the only things you substitute for are your U and your DX everything else stays there until you cross it out so let me ask you this question uh does the 2x Cub stay there y does the sign stay there does The X to 4 stay there what does that become that's your U very good does your DX stay there how much is your DX equal to show hands tell people okay with this example so trig function yes hard not really pick a u it becomes easier why is it become easier what happens now the X cubes are gone to right they're they're done that's great that has to happen right you have to get rid of your X's because now you're in terms of you you got to be in terms of youu and then you pull your four outside pull your four outside along with what other number the two over four that's going to give You2 do you see the 1/2 that I'm talking about so this is 2 over 4 I can show you both steps if you want 2 over 4 sin uu that's one2 sin U du now don't say it out loud because you need to practice trust me I want you on your paper to put down the integral of sign you don't s out try it on your own I know you're all going to give me cosine but what I'm looking for is whether it's positive cosine or negative cosine hopefully you put negative cosine did you put negative cosine yes good for you if you put positive cosine check it again you need be able to take a derivative of it and it gives you sign so this is negative cosine U plus are you okay with this so far what's the last thing that we do transl yeah maybe make it prettier that negative I don't like that in there I want to make this -2 cosine U but U is X 4th so I'm going to make this - 12 cosine X to 4 plus C that's how it should look at the end of your problem or if you wanted to put this over two you could do that what you can't do is this please look at the board please notice that2 does never ever goes inside an angle this is never x 4 2 you can't do that you can't break that angle relationship this is not multiplication it's cosine of something of some angle so you can't do any operations inside of that can't pull anything out unless you use angle formulas or something like like that uh we'll start one more I want to show you something here real quick we have about what 30 45 seconds left now this one looks pretty darn nasty yeah yeah but let's really think about what's going on here this is going to help you on some of your home works all right this is going to really help you actually what's the bracket mean but what's it mean everything's together take the integral of that right of what of all the stuff inside now tell me something you do with integrals as far as it relates to this problem separate add say say louder you can separate them by the addition side or subtraction right the only thing you can't touch is multiplication division so I could actually separate these two things get 1x^2 plus uh d D X Plus s^ 2kx DX that makes it a whole lot easier why does it make a whole lot easier well well look that's basic that's in your table make it X to -2 do the problem this that's integration by substitution sure you substitute your U = pix do the same thing so that's actually a little bit easier does that make sense to you so when you have an addition subtraction bre break it up before you start doing a substitution break it up sometimes you'll if you tried substitution here it's not going to work because you have this relationship that that'd be a bad thing you would want to do it there so break it up by addition subtraction then do your substitution on individual parts now if you remember we're doing integration which is basically find an anti-derivative and in some in other words find the area underneath the curve or find the area function of a curve and we're doing a special case of integration where it doesn't necessarily fit into the integration table exactly so we use some sort of substitution typically a use substitution to make it fit it's kind of like making this thing work for us which is great now I gave you a couple hints on how to do this number one hint is you're usually picking the inside of a function the inside part it's typically in parentheses or underneath a square root or something to a power you don't pick the whole thing you just pick a part of the thing the part that's actually giving you a problem for instance in this case the part that is not actually in the integration table so if I'm looking at this I know cosin's there but it says cosine X not 5x so what I would pick for the U in this case ISX the 5x yeah that's the inside also we'd say the derivative of your U typically must show up in the integral somewhere disregarding constants so let me ask you this what's a question of what's a question what's the derivative of 5x now we don't care about the five being up there because that's a constant we'll be able to pull that out as 1 uh so basically just our X's have to match up so again our idea was let's make a U substitution so that our integral will ultimately fit into our integration table if it fits then we can do it if it doesn't fit we basically can't do it right now now what did we do after we took the substitution what's the next step find of okay so derivative of both sides basically it's implicit differentiation we're keeping the DX on the right hand side so here we'll have du here we'll have 5 DX and I've told you to solve for DX some people do this differently uh some people don't solve for DX some people try to substitute in for uh make it something X DX and substitute for du I prefer solving for DX it just makes it a little bit easier for us so if we divide both sides by five we have du over 5 equals DX that lets us make our substitution so we go all right the cosine doesn't change but the 5x I'm going to let that become U and I'm going let DX become du over 5 the key thing for us was that in order to take an integration or do an integral two things must happen it's got to fit your table and the variables have to match so our respect to that variable must be the only variable you see there's x's and U's you've done something wrong or hav't gone very far enough so something has to take place where you have one variable and that that's the variable you're talking about you with me on this so far now the over five what can I do with that over five that's why we disregard the constants we really don't care about those it's all about the variables so this over five means 1 cosine u d that will be 1 all right folks let's do the integral of cosine U don't say it out loud I'll give you all just a second to think about it try to get in your head before someone says it okay so so think think think as I've been talking and rambling to keep you guys from Talking have you thought about the integral of cosine U of course it's going to be something to do with sign is it positive sign or negative sign oh you guys are guessing now don't guess at the stuff if you said negative sign take the derivative of negative sign it would give you negative cosine that is not what we have right there the derivative of s gives you cosine yes yes and that's the correct integral therefore does that make sense so be careful it's all about the signs with your trig uh it's it's never I mean no one's ever going to go um tangent yay no no one's ever going to make that mistake you're all going to give me sign right just depends on whether you get the sign right right anyway we're almost done there's one more thing that we have to do we we didn't start in terms of U so we can't leave it in terms of U we're going to translate this back to X's use the same substitution you you just made so our answer our integral will be 1/5 s of 5x and of course we got that plus C at the back end saying that could be any constant and still work as a function so that I take a derivative of it gives you back my cosine 5x by the way can you check your work absolutely absolutely take a simple derivative do you see the chain rule coming back at you the 1/5 time the five from that chain rule it's gone you got your cosine 5x how many feel okay with our example that's kind of refresher from last time since we had a a weekend in between here now let's do uh let's do one where I have you do this completely on your own see if you can do this and then I'll show you how to finally finish that example I I had you look at last time there you go let's work on that one not too bad just make sure you know the idea of the substitution well I hope for you in this case that the U is fairly obvious uh in the in this one the U is the only thing there the only thing I I wanted to make sure you here is do you take the exponent when you're picking a u do you ever take the exponent with it no because the derivative has to be there right so if I took a derivative of that it's 15 2x- that's not going to appear again in our integral that's that's not going to work out for so it's it's almost exclusively the inside of something uh that you pick for your U and and that works like 90% of the time by the way this substitution method sometimes makes integrals go really really fast have you found that out too it's kind of nice if you can find the right substitution that's the hardest part then it works itself out last thing we'll do if you don't want to put a plus c right here that's fine just make sure it's at the very end of your problem you have to have a plus c but make sure you have substitute back in for X I get a lot of people make it down this far which is technically correct but it's also te it's also incorrect because we want this in terms of X not in terms of U so if you didn't make it down that far just do your substitution and that's what we should get how many people were able to make it down that far on their own good that's that's all about everybody that's fantastic all right now if this is new to you then of course this is going to take you some time to figure out now the last one before we go on to some a little bit more advanced idea up here the last one I think I showed you the first step here last time I said that don't don't let the integral really confuse you into making you think it's something harder than it is uh namely if I were to look at that integral right now and try to pick a substitution there is not a good substitution for that right now because if I pick that as my U I'm still going to have X in there right so I'd have a du something and I'd have a x and that's not going to work out for you you can't do a direct substitution on that interval the way it is right here but what what you can do is use some of the principles of integrals they're basically the same as derivatives uh it says you can pull constants outside of your integral if they're being multiplied by some function of X it says you can split up the integral or derivative by addition and subtraction not multiplication but definitely addition subtraction so what this says is this is really not one giant integral it's actually two separate integrals if you want to think about it that way so the first thing I'm doing some of these integrals if they look too daunting you're like oh my gosh I don't even know where to begin see if there's a plus and a minus if there is sometimes you're able to separate those and sometimes it makes it easier and I know I did show this to you last time but this you can look at as 1x^2 DX don't forget the DX and see s of pix don't forget the DX now can you do this one MH what would be the first step on doing that one by the way bring the X to the top very good because it's got to fit your table right there's no substitution needed you don't need that but you know how to do this one already we practice that how about this one is there a substitution necessary for this one yeah there is because that's not just an X that's a PIX what I'd like you to do is figure that out okay go ahead and do both integrals this one's kind of a basic one this one's going to require substitution for it for so what do you do with these things when it's plus and minus or you're supposed to break up first which is also what you're supposed to do with your girlfriend right before Valentine's Day just so you know way you don't have to buy presents it's a bogus holiday anyway christm if you time it right and you break up right before Valentine's and right before her birthday and right before Christmas and get back with her it's awesome he saves so much money just kidding just I've never personally done that I know someone who was done to but she three times I'll tell you the story later okay so your U should be pix remember it's it's the inside of something if you're having trouble looking for a or finding a u and there's something in parenthesis try it what's it hurt I it takes 5 Seconds to figure out you're wrong right that's all it takes so if you're having trouble just pick something and if you're wrong you're wrong who cares just go back and redo it later pick something else there's only a finite number of selections you can make in an integral so if you try something and you're right great if you try something you're wrong just pick something else don't give up du in this case is Pi Pi DX so du oh remember Pi is a constant right so if it was 3x it'd be 3 now it's not 3x it's 3.141592 whatever forever but it's Pi so D over pi equals DX and now we can go ahead and make our substitution and it only affects the second integral because I have two distinct integrals now which is great and that's what we want so here we're going to have integral of the secant squar does not change only the angle changes remember this is not being multiplied either that is not a multiplication that's secant of of not not times that's your angle you can't manipulate that in any other way besides the substitution that's going to be a u and then du over Pi how many people made the substitution looks just like that good that's fantastic that's a correct substitution now this integral is pretty easy we're going to do x to the -3 over3 right what I do wrong it's a very common mistake yeah and some people go oh you're adding 2+ 1 is three well you have negatives here so it's kind of flipp on you-1 over1 don't add a plus c yet that's fine we can add a plus c at the very end of our problem if you add it now it might get a little confusing for you then a plus sign because you have a plus sign I know the integral of see squ U is good because a derivative of tangent is secant Square that's why that works remember we're just going opposite of a derivative now not tangent squar either just tangent U what happens to that Pi one I guess I'll show you that step huh the over Pi you can make that one over pi and then secant s u if you'd like to show that that's probably the appropriate way to write it show your constants pulling out it's on a denominator stays on a denom and then go for it we already talked this is tangent U have a plus c here or not we just need one plus C at the very end of our problem we'll probably make things a little bit prettier and what I mean by that is we'll drop down our negative exponent this will be -1x this will be plus tangent well tangent of U now our U is listed right up here we just have to put it back in its place you you can have one over Pi if you'd like or you can have the whole thing over Pi if you'd like it doesn't really matter one thing I do have to make certain that you do know do those pies cross out no Heaven no OMG that earns you a big fat Circle no with like 10 exclamation points and I burn your paper in front of you right that's what that earns you no you can't because like I said that's not multiplication that's an angle this is division you cannot cross that there's no trig rule that says you can what you do need to do is put a plus c how many people feel okay with that example good so looks difficult sure is it really no not not really is this one not really as long as you know the correct substitution that's what this whole process is about and that's why I'm giving you so many examples so you kind of see some different instances of what you can do uh what you can't do and some substitutions you ready to tackle this problem then yes okay now is that in your integration table no no s is cosine is but not s Square cosine well here's the deal if we're talking about using a substitution to solve this well what would a good substitution be because here's here's a deal if I pick cosine the derivative of cosine is negative sign right well that's up there if I pick s the derivative of sign is cosine well that's up there so which is the correct choice and the one is the answer is the one that takes care of all the other X's so for instance if I picked let me show you how how you find out your your wrong on uh substitution in about 5 Seconds you ready here's how you find out your wrong you pick your U you take your derivative maybe 15 seconds I don't know you solve for DX and you do your substitution and it comes out with something that doesn't work for you for instance this is still s squ x right the cosine was U and DX is Du over sinx now one thing that's great about this is this is gone but only one of those is gone did I get rid of all the x's and there's nothing else you can do there if it if it didn't work out kind of nicely for you either there's another substitution you have to make or you made the wrong substitution and that's most of the time in this class that's most the time what happens all right so for us we go oh man this didn't work for us I better not try to like force this through it's kind of like U oh my gosh I almost made a Star Wars analogy uh totally yeah well anyway yeah you have to let the force flow you can't force this thing oh it didn't work it doesn't you can't make it happen you got to just let it let it work for you yes I'm that much of a so anyway how do we find S to or the correct U to begin with we'll think about it what's sin^2 x mean sin x little two right it's actually inside of parentheses with an exponent and that's the correct substitution so this really means this now of course if I wrote it like that it's a little bit easier to see now I'm not going to write it like that because we typically will write trig functions with the S squar but you need to know what that means so our appropriate U substitution is sinx derivative of sinx folks the derivative of sinx is it positive or negative cosine the derivative of sinx positive or negative cosine positive okay good solve for DX which means we're going to divide on both sides and now when we do our substitution we go all right well what gets replaced with you now does the cosine get replaced with you or the sign get repl with you do do I mess the two up or is that still there still there so this actually becomes U2 is the cosine X still here for right now yes is the DX still here no no because I need to translate that into my du somehow I know I translate it into a u I'm going to have to have a du and I know that DX was equal to cosine sorry uh cosine X under d you see anything nice that happens one of the kind of prerequisites for this to work I told you is you got to get rid of all the variables except for U you can't have both x's and U's so you have to have something that gets rid of stuff that's why we say the derivative has to be somewhere in there because when you solve for DX you divide by the derivative or you multiply in some cases by the derivative and that will show up somehow when you make your substitution it's got to be there so we're going to have have an integral of U2 now that's a whole lot easier to look at than that isn't it man this is piece of cake this is going to be U 3 over 3 no problems and then done no not yet oh you can you can right now yeah make sure you end in X's you start in X's you end in X's so sin Cub X over 3 + C still WR all is 13 time you can do one3 if you'd like because it really doesn't matter and that's true for all these problems uh how feel okay with that one good all right good would you like to try a few more yes let's do like uh one two let's do like four or five more and we'll talk about the area by the way the reason why I'm stressing this so much is because there's really only two sections on integrals that you cover it was 4.1 and this that's it the rest of the stuff is how to use them um so it's kind of like how we did derivatives right we did chain rule we did product rule quotient Rule and then for the rest of the chapters I showed you how to apply them wasn't any new different techniques and that's the way this is going to be too so this is the techniques you need in order to go further to solve the application problems in I'm going to show you all right now how about this you know what I see a lot this is hilarious I love this this is my favorite problem to some one of my favorite problems to great I think because it makes me laugh and then cry and then laugh some more when I get over crying I love seeing that could you please do that for me good I see that where are they I don't know I don't know don't do that to me okay that one day I swear one one day I know how I'm going to die it's going to be grading papers and one day my head is just going to explode and then High Velocity splatter was on your paper you're like H that must have died that's how you'll know if I don't come into class it was probably because you you're going to kill me people are going to kill no we can't do that can't do that we've talked about that a lot in this class because I need to make the the distinction between an angle and a multiplication problem so this is not true that you can just cross those things things out but what you can do is try to make that fit in integration table by a substitution now right now it's of course not I mean the only thing we have that deals with cosine is cosine X this is not cosine X or cosine U this is not cosine U we need to make it somehow that so that we can fit it so what's the appropriate substitution the co including the cosine or not do you think the square because if you include the cosine well the derivative of cosine is negative sign right that would have to show up somewhere in your integral that's not there it's also a u is typically on the inside of something so what's on the inside of something here x square root X let's take that as our U let's see see what happens so not the cosine just the square root of x and the reason why we're seeing it is not here so much it's there that's where we're seeing it now would you substitute that's a great question that's a great question well we're going to find that out right now okay so we made our substitution because I taught you how to look for it right I said it's typically on the inside of something so you're seeing because I showed you that the square root of x now you got to find the derivative of the square root of x and then see what you're going to substitute for maybe not substitute for do your substitution later later you follow me so let's go ahead and do this now in order to take a derivative I'm probably going to write this as 12 don't make the mistake of putting square or netive - 1/2 that will really mess you up you need to know how to do this correctly that's why we spend so much time doing derivatives so X to the2 uh how much is Du equal to everybody you need to know this what is it oh great everybody that's like five people come on you can do a derivative right 12 x to the what negative one2 very good so we're subtracting negative one what else do not forget DX don't forget that okay now we've done our derivative what are you supposed to do now for this problem okay let's be very careful on this and solve for DX how do you get rid of the 1/2 so I'm going to say that this is 2du = x - 12 DX is that true for you just to make it seem a little bit more understandable where this stuff is going to be coming from I'm also going to make this side prettier before I start dividing you can divide right now that's fine but you could also look at it as 2D = DX over X2 does that make sense to you you could divide option number one is doing this way option number two is this look at the board here real quick if you wanted to divide right now this would give you 2du X1 12 equal DX right you follow me on that on this case I'd be multiplying by X to the2 on both sides this will give me 2 x to2 du equal DX and you know what look at the board sold that one do you see that moving that negative up to the numerator will be 2 x to POS 12 DX d = d yeah so there's a couple ways to do this either way is fine no way is better than the other way I really don't care how you do it what I care about is can you follow me can you guys do it from here to there and get the right signs in the right places where have be okay with that I know it's basic algebra but you know what that's our main struggle basically in calculus is basic algebra so you okay with it you sure okay okay now I'm going to answer Scott's question Scott's question was since I made this a u do I make this a u and the answer is well let's let's look at your substitution you you have to find a place for this right do you notice how this has an X if I make this into a u watch what would happen watch by the way this is 2 < TK X du = DX you guys see that right look what would happen if I do cosine U over U cosine U over U I can't just make this a du even if I did it wouldn't work because we don't have cosine U over U that doesn't work you can't make it co U to the 1 time cosine U and split it up so you don't even know how to take U to the ne 1 because it's lnu we're not even in that part of the class so we can't do that one anyway but this is this would not be du it would be 2un X du is there a place to get rid of the X what's the one necessity for substitution work got to get you got to have just use right just use and it has to fit your integration table otherwise you did something wrong or you haven't gone far enough now we did something wrong because we can't cross that out and that's a problem if you have two different variables that's typically a big problem for you you've gone you've done something a mistake in the previous problem now what I can tell you is this this was the correct substitution right DX was that so that's the correct substitution I know that picked my U here and that's the inside of something so that had to be right the only wrong part was probably this one and if I move it back to what it actually is the square root of x do you see how that's really going to help us out what's that going to do for us so that's gone hey now I'm good to go by the way that two is that a 1/2 or a two over one what does that so when I pull this out in front of my integral it's two cosine U du that's a pretty easy integral right there that's pretty easy one what's the integral of cosine U du positive or negative signi very good you can think of it so s u this equals 2 sin U that is 2 sin let's go ahead and substitute back in for What U is look like square root of x put a plus c behind it and you are done we still feeling okay okay tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to give you one to do on your own uh we'll kind of go back and forth like that hopefully for a little while um I'll give you one and maybe I'll help you with the next one but I want you to mostly do it uh let's see if you can you can manage to do this one go ahead and follow the process down to find it of you it looks horrible it's going to look horrible it's not going to be horrible though as long if you follow this this process there you go really it looks bad doesn't it a little it's not bad it really isn't the hardest ones are trig ones uh manipulating trig identities to get something to fit your integration table that's the hardest for us it's either I mean if it's not true it's shoot it's a it's a finite integration table it has to fit so if it doesn't fit directly by breaking up fractions and combining like terms or something or separating integrals uh then it has to fit with a substitution if it's not those two things it's not going to be in here we can't do it I why don't you give it a try I want you to find your U I'll put the U up on the board here in just a second take to take the derivative both sides do your substitution and see what happens remember it's up to you to find your you you got you guys got to be able to do that I can't just walk you through it all the time when I pick my hue should I pick it with the cube root or without the cube root without definitely without definitely without with with the cube root it's a chain rule very hard to do uh you have some crazy stuff going on definitely without did you pick that as your U it's inside something the derivative is kind of up there not really because you had a constant but kind of up there it's good good sign derivative oh man uh 25x 4th orative 25x better not lose that negative oh goodness let's do a little dividing now we're going to go real slow this is not the time to take it quick and make a mistake by doing the math in your head it's time to write it out and really get the hand handle of this stuff all right not not doing everything all fancy Dancy I know there's an X to 4th I'm going to leave it a cube root for right now I'm going to make it a u in there did you make it that far wait now you if you did you actually made it that far yes these two rows yes the DX the DX is Du over - 25x to 4 right here you should be able to tell whether you made the correct substitution or not don't Hammer at this thing if you made the wrong substitution should be apparent to you uh did you make the right substitution yeah how do you know that's great that's what you want to have happen so X's are gone if that happens most likely you made the right choice are there times when you didn't there's times you have to go further yeah but for us most of the time this works okay let's make things a little bit better tell me what I do with the -25 and becomes what negative something right -1 25th whatever that is I don't really care how about the the cube root of U is it U to the 3 U to the2 what is that 13 very good and then then du we made our substitution no problem we kept it a cube root okay we kept x to the 4th we don't change that yet we made our DX exactly what we solved for not a big deal crossed out our x to the four that's great pull out the 1 over-25 made 125th perfect we have a cube root into a 1/3 power and now we have something that fits our integration table and it it looked nasty easy that's easy has to be easy has to put your integration table if it's not easy you did something wrong it's not necessarily true some of them kind of get a little bit nastier but for the for the most part that's true folks oh by the way this a good time to tell you this when you do an integral you don't write the integral anymore so I'm not going to do this I'm not going to write U to the what is 1 plus that uh 4/3 over 4/3 over one over 34 you don't keep writing that integral it's like taking a square root of something right if you do this and you take the square root of 49 you don't write the square root of seven at least I hope you don't write that you just write seven right when you're done with the square root you're done with square root when you're done with integral you're done with the integral you don't keep writing it just like a derivative you want to keep writing a derivative now let's make this side a little bit better we got -1 over 25 we have 3 U 4/3 over 4 you see how to flip that up or you could do 34 you could so we're going to go ahead and multiply that that's going to be -3 U to the 4/3 over looks like 100 plus C we don't have to do it quite yet if you want to that's fine uh just make sure you have it at the end of your problem all right so right now there's one more thing I need be even before a plus c if if you want yeah we don't want to end in u what you can do you can go one more step on this thing and put it back into radical notation if you would like that will be -3 a cube root 3 - 5x 5 all to 4th power all over 100 plus C I was waiting for yes no yeah you get have the3 over 100 times that whole thing what I really care about is do you see I mean when you get get really good at derivatives you've been doing this for a while you can see it even better but do you see that this is the derivative of that you see some things coming out of that 4/3 goes down to 1/3 mhm derivative of the inside is something X 4th there's just something X 4th that 25 that's going to it's going to simplify down to that so that is going to work that's a nice way to kind of check your work is with the derivative you having fun yet yes this is like the uh the pure non theory part of this class right this is like we're just hammering down on some problems right now which I guess can be kind of fun we get theory part uh probably next time where we're going to find out why this is the way that it is because I said so that's your theory behind three way to do things right way WR way Mr the way how they discovered the term for the right way all right so integral of x^2 < TK xus one now now this one might trick you if you really don't listen to what I what I said before this one might trick you here's why it might trick you I said two things have to happen first you pick your U so it makes it easier you pick your U because it's typically the inside of something and you pick your U where the derivative is there that's where the problem might come in here because and it goes in the order which I told you uh it goes in the order of pick it make it easier pick it make it on inside of something pick it so the derivative is there now is this on the inside of something the derivative is not really there cuz that's the inside of something that's a problem now I pick this as my U my derivative is just one that doesn't take care of the X squ so this is kind of something we're like oh my gosh I have no idea pick something pick something and pick something that's the inside that's the best way to start if you pick the inside do you notice how you don't know how to take the integral of the sare root of x - one right but you do know how to take the integral of square root of U you with me on that if that's U to the 1/2 that fits that's how you pick your U so here you are right let's go ahead and pick our u x -1 are you okay with this so far right du is what 1 DX or in other words simply DX you feel okay you sure now we're going to do some fancy map fancy map is X2 still there is a square root still there is the xus one still there what is it it is me and is the DX still there no is D what's the problem on our problem we have X yeah you know what's not cool about integrals is you can't pull out like an X squ that just doesn't work right because otherwise these problems will all be very very easy otherwise you can just separate them here and that would be nice but you can't you have to make everything either all x's and work or use and work the problem is this is our problem that X squ right there this is nice this is nice that's great that's our problem how do we deal with our problem well maybe you see it do you see anything we can do we could kind of maybe manipulate the substitution we have to fit that so for instance look at our our substitution it's U equal xus one you follow here's the logic here I hope you can follow this the logic is what if I can somehow make another substitution for X2 if I can do that maybe it'll work I don't know but we we're trying here but maybe we can do that so so look up here in our board we got we got u = x -1 what I want you to do do when you whenever you get this case and you know you made the only substitution you can make right that's the only one you can make that's it no other substitution would be even close to good you know make the only one try to do another form of substitution over here so for instance I want to get an X squ let's make this somehow an X squ tell me what I have to do probably solve for x first would be a great idea let's add one if you add one do you see that you get X = U + 1 follow me on that X = U + 1 how do you get x^2 out of X that is an equation isn't it if I Square both sides yeah that works that works you okay with that one note that if you distribute this you get u^2 + 2 U + 1 you still okay should we distribut yes uh notice there's no DX there's no du there's nothing because we haven't done derivatives here all we're doing is making a direct statement of what x^2 is in terms of you and we got that from our substitution by show at hands tell feel okay with what we we've just done have I lost you at all we're okay okay let's see what we have instead of X2 I've already solved for X2 I've got u^2 plus 2 U + one what must absolutely must why because we have multiplication and you got square root of U probably a great thing to do at this point would be change that into an exponent U ^2 + 2 U + 1 * u^ 12 power to you now why did I do that why why is this going to work for us what can you do if you distribute everything's in terms of Ed right can't you use those exponents to your advantage now notice what we can't do we can't just take an integral right here we can't take an integral right now we would have to absolutely distribute that so when we do recall that you add exponents when you multiply so this is going to be U to the 5 Hales this will be 2 U to the 3es plus u to the 12 du did I do my math right on that can you take an integral of that one very easily each one of those fits remember we're going to stop right in our integral if we manipulate those fractions what I'm looking at is 2 U 7es over 7 plus 4 notice the 2 * 2 U to the 5 halfes over five plus 2 U to the three halfes over three we're very close to done what's the last thing we got to do subtitute back yeah we got to make sure we're in terms of X not U put a plus c at the end and we will be done so final answer what was it x - one now you can make those all Roots if you'd like to they're all square roots of x -1 to some power uh you can leave them as as fractions I really don't care as long as you make that far that's great that's what I care about how many people feel they can make it that far good now we have a couple more minutes let me show you one more example uh we'll finish this off next time but I want to St just talk about the first step what's a good choice for your U is it 2 - x is it including the square root is it the 2x^2 - 8x + 1 yes probably if it's going to be anything it's probably that you don't want to pick just a little piece of that if you're going to pick something pick the whole thing inside right not the not the whole thing include the square root but the whole inside part for sure if we were to pick that which is really if you can see it you kind of get an understanding of this substitution thing that really is your only even close to good choice here you with me now the problem is if I take you for this is my derivative of this up there what is my derivative DX like that right make sure you have parentheses around that my question is this can you make this thing look like this thing factor out not a four not a four if you factor out of four please watch if you factor out of four you get x - 2 does that match up no those are not the same4 oh but Factor out4 negative positive or in other words that does that match up now that's great that's what you want to have happen so the reason why I give you these last four examples is to show you that your U might still work even though it's not maybe completely obvious to you you you think through it you might have to manipulate just little pieces of it and then it it works perfect remember it has to work perfect otherwise you can't do a substitution so it's somehow manipulate it work with it don't just give up on it oh we'll finish this one off next time and uh two more so we're going to continue finishing up this problem uh what we're what we're seeing is how to do substitution even when it doesn't look like maybe you can do a substitution sometimes you can so all you got to do is just try it out now last time I believe we were talking about picking this is our our U and seeing if a substitution will work when you pick your substitution again it has to be on the inside of something and typically everything as far as driva goes must also be in your integral disregarding the constant so here we're going to have a du = 4x - 8 DX we all know how to do that the problem is that's not directly in your integral so you're going to have to manipulate at least some order to make this thing work now one thing people suggested was what if we were to factor out the four if we factor out the four you got x - 2 DX that looks pretty close pretty close but it's not exactly right and it's got to be exactly right for you to eliminate it you follow me so what was the suggestion someone else gave after this maybe instead of four yeah the4 because what the4 would do factor4 out changes that to a and that to a plus and if I just reorder it a little bit I get 2 - x DX so far so good of course we can solve for DX and now we're finally ready to do our substitution if we do the substitution here we'll get do we still have a 2 - x on the numerator yeah you still have a 2 - x on the numerator that's not something we've gotten rid of yet remember the only things you can get rid of is whatever you're calling your U and whatever youve solved for DX that's the only two things you really substitute in for everything else should take care of itself really so here we haven't touched that yet that's 2 - x the square root should the square root still be there what's inside of the square root those are entire you you're right and then should DX still be there no yeah DX no we'll make that substitution that nice jump it's also nice that we made it look exactly the same here that way it's very easy to see what we can and what we can't do with our problem now so what can you do that's completely gone on what do you do with the4 okay so I'm going to make itative 1/4 if that's okay with you guys what else would you like to do turn your square root of U into a u to thetive one2 okay so the square root itself turns into a 1/2 but then to move it to the numerator that's where it becomes negative so yeah you're absolutely right we're going to make this4 we haven't done anything with that integral of that's U to the -2 du from here it fits our table perfectly that's great because if it didn't we'd have to do more work we don't want to do more work make it as easy as possible then do your integral then re substitute back in from U Back Into terms of X and you're done so in our we've got the 1/4 still hanging on We've Got U to the what's that going to be 12 over over2 yeah exponent over new exponent still okay you sure this 1/4 and that 1 12 notice that really this two is going to go up to that numerator because you you separate reciprocate and multiply you get I I'll show you both steps here you'd get /4 * 2 U to the2 like that well this is going to simplify -2 U to the2 or you could have it U to the2 over 2 netive U the2 over 2 that's fine what we got to do now is what yeah so I'll make it -2 U becomes whatever we had for a substitution that's 2x^2 - 8x + 1 to the 1/2 power what's the 1/2 power again so could you write this as a square root instead of that 1/2 sure you could that's fine plus C show up hands how we will K with this so far are you getting the hang of the substitution hopefully after the practice last night then you you have at least a great idea on what's going on the last one we're going to talk about is this one I'll give you one more trig one because I know you guys love it so much right oh yeah thank you you wel that's a good one why is that a good one cuz right now you're looking at it and you're stumped right cuz I would be if I was in your seat I wouldn't know what to do we could try some things you could try picking X that's not really going to help right just changes cosine Cub of x to cosine Cub of U to U that doesn't really do much we try P picking cosine X right because it's cosine X to the thir power true but the derivative of cosine X is sin x is there sin x up there then that would be a problem when if you come around this this situation you know that the derivative of cosine is basically s negative but basically s if you ignore the constant and the derivative of s is cosine right you're going to have to have both those things up there so when we have a cosine cubed and there's no sign that's going to be really hard to deal with if we don't have a sign because as soon as you pick some U with a that has a trig you're going to have a derivative that has some trig in it right it's got to be up there somewhere here's maybe a way to deal with this break off something that you know has an identity to it for instance cosine Cub I don't know any identity with that but I do know an identity with coine s squar maybe break out the cosine squar see what happens is it in the cosine squared going to give you a s squared in there somewhere yeah we'll see we'll see what happens well that was relatively painless cosine s time cosine is still cosine Cub so that works now I still can't pick that as a u because the derivative of cosine is not cosine so I got to change this into a sign somehow and then we'll take our Ru how much is cosine squar cosine there's no identity with that right but cosine squar has an identity what is cosine squ very good you use the Pythagorean theorem uh the Pagan identity for um s and cosine I mean and what this says is that instead of cosine squ sure why don't you make it 1us sin s x which is true because of sin 2 X plus cosine s x equals 1 subtract one of the other and you have uh the alternate trade function that you're looking for do you feel okay so far now let's think about this think about it what should your U be what should your you be are you saying wait wait I'll give you options your only op there's four options one two of them are not good options option number one is to five options I guess well you can really screw this thing up option number one is picking X for you no not going to do anything option number two is picking cosine X for you this is going to hurt you with that right because you can't directly just cross out that sign you can't do that and you still have a s x there still have a sign X that would be a problem you see the problem bad option option number three picking the whole entire thing here picking the whole entire thing you pick the whole entire thing you got to take the derivative of the whole entire thing it has to show up der of the whole entire thing is a general power rule you see general power rule there 2 sinx cosine X does that appear no bad option option number four picking just this part sin 2 x is that a good option again you have to take the derivative of that that's 2 sin x cosine X that's not up here again you pick the inside thing remember that this is sin x^2 right you with me this is this the the U's are inside of something you rarely rarely take a u that has a function and a power that's too much cuz when you take the the derivative it's a chain rule if you're having to take a chain rule for your derivative of U you might have picked the wrong U do you see what I'm talking about because you're going to get that function back again and it has to appear exactly in your integral that's often times not going to happen so this whole thing no no because that's a chain rule or general power rule however you want to say it this thing Ah that's the inside is the derivative of s x in your integral then that's the correct U what is the derivative of sinx is it positive or negative cosine I still have some people giving me negatives be careful on what you're doing integrals versus derivatives this is a derivative derivative of sin x is positive cosine X DX when you divide by cosine you get du over cosine x equals DX hey we're we're almost good to go let's check this thing out we've got integral of 1 what's the sin x going to become for us folks did we sell the square yes so you didn't even have to deal with the square right u^ squ is easy you didn't have to pick the whole thing because you can take an integral of U2 that's great do I still have a cosine X right here uh at this point yes at this point absolutely ideal do I still have a DX it is instead our substitutions du over cosine X does something nice happen nice awesome now I do know it's easier when I do it than when you do it at home right you probably spend 20 minutes on that problem which is okay but you're going to start learning some of these things as you go on I I think I gave you some hints of the begin of the problem when you have trig functions the derivative has to be there so break up some things see if you can make it see if you can work with it this one's turned out to be so nice 1 - u^2 du that's not bad not bad at all can take the integral of 1 - u^2 du fits perfectly in an integration table what's the integral of one tell me that x no not X U yes why U and not X because at your variable you're integrating with respect you that's why the D whatever is important U minus what don't get confused I know it's confusing you're going between derivatives and integrals and we're doing them the same problem right derivative of sign and then you're going to take integral of oh man be careful don't rush think through it so far okay at the end sub you can add it here I don't care substitute in yes so you was right here sinx sin cubed x over 3 plus that's what you need do you feel with it it's going to take a while to master it right yes practice a lot of practice uh but it's possible you know you you guys have the the fundamentals down you understand the substitution that's really all there is to it as far as substitution goes the substitution part is pretty easy right it's making it fit the substitution that's a little bit harder sometimes but work with it especially the trig ones get through that stuff get over the hump and then you'll you'll be okay with it this the last example as far as substitution I'm going to give you are there any questions before we move on all right [Music] 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 4.3:  Area Under a Curve, Limit Approach, Riemann Sums
so now that we've basically mastered how to take an anti-derivative find an anti-derivative we have fit in the table which is in the problem just undoing a derivative and we now have integration by substitution which does the same thing just a kind of fancy way to do it we're going to find out why all this stuff actually works so we're going to study in section 4.3 how to find the area how to actually find the area now we've done this I've told you that it is that integral is basically find an area but would you like to see why I hope you want to see why this is the Y part so here's the Y because I said so no I wish make my job easy do it because I said so so let's talk about area as a limit before we can get to area as a limit I got to tell you something about what's called Sigma notation you ever seen a sigma before yeah if you're ever in a fraternity or something you know there there's this Greek letter is called Sigma uh Sigma is this looks like a sideways capital M looks like that you seen those what's it mean yeah it's a Greek letter s really so it means Su it says what you're supposed to do is add whatever I tell you to add so let's just give a quick easy example that right there that k = 0 says the variable or the indices I'm going to be using is the letter K I'm going to start where k equals 0 I'm going to stop where K = 5 and I'm going to do that to each of the following K cubes here's what Sigma notation means it says what you're going to do is let K go to all the integers integers are are the whole numbers between this one and this one so basically between and including so you're going to start at zero for k then you're going to go 1 2 3 4 5 and six right why not six that's too far that's too far so we'd stop at five and we're going to add all of that up so Sigma notation says it's a sum Su means add you'd have 0 cubed plus because you have a sigma then you'd have oh the next one is 1 cubed and then okay we're going to add to Sigma then we'd have 2 cubed we'd have 3 cubed we' have 4 cubed and we would have 5 cubed and that's what the sigma notation actually stands for do you feel okay with the sigma notation I need a head not before we go on any further you okay with that okay good well scared me for a second now do I care what that is yeah ultimately I do but I'm going to give you better I'm going to give you better ways to manipulate that before I give you those ways I got to tell you about some properties they're not hard properties in fact you're going to discover that they're very very similar to what we can do with derivatives and integrals namely these two uh if you have any summation oops I missed something and you have a function of K that's a function of K right times a constant what you can do is this that c if it doesn't depend on the K you can pull out in front of your summation that's a true statement you can pull out any constant so this would be if C does not depend on K only in terms of multiplication yes if C does not depend on K let me show you an example this is going to blow your mind like a grenade like a m grenade some of you aren't going to like this very much till you really think about it hopefully you think about it that way you like it that's my circular Logic for you um what's your indices your index no your index should be the letter that starts at one and goes to five J is your index here so the function should be in terms of J anything depending on J cannot be moved outside anything not depending on J for this context is like a constant what's the function inside x x x to the X to the 3 right is that a j no has nothing to do with J right nothing at all you know what I can do with that that's this this does not this does not mean the same thing as this does right this is not that right here this is X cubed x Cub if I had this if I had X Cub * J then this would be X Cub time summation J = 1: 5 of J I could do that anything not depending on J that's being multiplied I can take out believe me now I'm going to erase this because I want you to really think about what this means when I have no J when I have no J what's there a what you were right I just didn't hear you I didn't make sense yeah won very what does it mean to do a summation from J = 1 to 5 of one I need you to kind of get that where you have constant inside here's what this this actually means it means you add up whatever's here from 1 to 5 right now there's no place to plug in one there's no place to plug in two or three or four or five so what this means is the X Cub is going to hang out front X CU is going to hang out front no matter what you follow me this says what are you adding from 1 to five what are you adding from 1 to five is one a constant then one does not change this says you have when you go to one you have one when you go to two you have one not two when you go to three you have one when you go to four you have one when you go to Five you have one this basically means 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 1 2 3 4 5 mhm does that make sense to you basically this is going to be whatever that number is n five in this case so this would be 5 x cub that's what that means now it should make a whole lot of sense because if you just think through it I mean think about this this says you have X Cub + x Cub plus X Cub plus X Cub plus X Cub you get 5x Cub feel okay with the first property yeah why not you sure are the questions so far some of you staring at me blankly some me I'm boring you tears I hope I boring you tears I don't do with tears very well so don't start crying makes me feel awkward sensitive and stuff okay second property second property just like you do with derivatives or with integrals you can break up addition and subtraction so if you have summation of two functions in terms of K that are being added together yeah it means that you can do summation of the first function plus summation of the second and and it also works with subtraction we got to do one more thing before we get into actual theory on why this stuff works I got to tell you some uh some ways to manipulate these things the way you can figure out some sums which is kind of nice uh the formulas now these are in your book but I'll give them to you explicitly the most common ones that you're going to use and then we'll start talking about this so let's kind of consider what this is you know maybe I'll give you a last one too I'll start with this last one because I want you to see it we've talked about it though what would a summation be from K = 1 to n of the number one the difference between whatever you're overthinking it n n 1 + 1+ 1+ 1+ 1 n * yes K is like equal to five n time five I mean four say we start at one because that's a one okay you always start one oh it always does no matter what unless I tell you otherwise but yeah no room you start at one so if you always start at one like I showed you here you start at one and you go to n you add one n times you get n you see the N also if this had been any other number like four notice that what you could do is p pull the four out front four times and change that into a one that works that'd be four * n 4 n yes if K starts at two or at three that was his question it won't it doesn't do that not for these formulas to work if it did you'd have to figure out from one to n and subtract off from one to four okay or whatever wherever this started that would be the appropriate way to do that is a good question you can do just understand the point I said if you figure out from 1 to n but you start at four just figure out from 1 to three one less than that and then you subtract that that'd be fine it is some now back to this what this stands for is let's see 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 plus all the way to n true okay and what this stands for is 1 2 + 2 2 + 3 2+ all the way to N2 agree okay and what this one stands for is 1 Cub + 2 Cub + 3 Cub plus all the way to NB are you okay on all this this notation right here what this is what this is called is open form this is called open form notation so where you're actually explicitly adding every thing together youie Okie doie so far what's awesome about this is someone's done the work found the pattern and you can do it on your own if you want I'm not going to do this for you takes a long time not too long but I'm not going to prove it I'm going to give you what's called the closed form the closed form says shoot if you know where you start and you know where you end and you know what you're doing you should be able to come with a formula for it and there are formulas the first formula for this for this one so if you go from one to n of K summation of K it says if you take the the number that you're ending at what number are you ending at here n yeah sure and you multiply it by n + 1 and you divide it by two you're going to come with the same answer which is pretty fantastic actually it's kind of cool uh there's this guy named KL Frederick G and way back in the day uh he's I don't I don't remember his exact age but he was in grade school and the teacher came in like hung over or something and uh this is way back in the day by the way like on a Wednesday um said uh said you know what I'm not feeling why don't you guys just add the numbers from one to 100 and so he goes okay like two minutes later he comes and these are little kids comes back goes it's 550 or whatever it was I don't remember what it was uh it's it's this and the teacher goes how in the world did you do this so quick he goes well obviously he he invented that he came with it on his own is it you yeah yeah the count Oiler Oiler I'm sure he would have as well maybe he did maybe have the names conf I doubt it I don't think so because Leonard Oiler his first name is Leonard and it's near and dear in my heart so okay second one's a little bit more advanced second one says what you're going to do is take n * n + 1 times the 2 n + 1 and divide by six and that'll do it kid also came up with that let me guess he grew up to win a Nobel Prize in mathematics I don't think there was a Nobel Prize but if there was he would have done it yeah got a genius um Jordan gon elimination is what you use for Matrix operations can't believe that um and some Far reaching mathematics it's just out of this world literally uh spatial things like Newton did the last one's really similar to the first one very very similar here's how you calc the last one looks exactly the same but you square I don't have the time to show you how these things are made up I really don't it's it's for a different class actually there there's ways you do this um if you'd like to see that come and see me some of the time and we can figure it out together we'll just go through and invent them if You' like uh but for right now just feel okay with this okay also feel okay with with this one as well yes even if that's a constant [Music] so we should have memorized yeah would you be able to follow that as well if one gives you n c gives you C * n c * 1 that would be the same TI let's do one very quick example on how you would go about doing this but you'll see it's not actually that bad it's plugging numbers in and then just manipulating those numbers so you will have some homework on how to do this uh follow the appropriate form and see that you can actually manipulate them because we're going to be using this in the next area idea that we have okay what we're going to do is we're going to try to come up with the sum of that thing what it actually equals that's a number number a number so we're going to come up with a numerical expression that represents that thing now give me some ideas what you can and what maybe you can't do on this name one thing you can't do right here what I haven't told you about distribute the K can you distribute the K I don't know that's a good question can you separate by multiplication is if they both involve a k can you do that no not if our index K which it is if these all match up you can't separate that multiplication that's not in our property list you follow me on that that's a no no can do on that one can you distribute the K yes you can though it's a function of K times a function of K you can distribute that that's okay so that would actually probably the first thing we would do because right now we can't use any of those those closed form this called close form the Clos form uh formulas to work with the stuff until they look exactly like this this or that you got me so Joe's got a good idea k s + K yes no very easy name something some on the right hand side of the room name another thing that you can do right here break it say it louder break it apart sure by addition because we know we can do that hey one thing real quick could I pull this k out in front of this no what if that was an X yes okay very good do these fit now yes now we can just use the formulas what's the N that I'm talking about what is that n that's just the number I'm stopping at in this case that's 10 so if we can figure out how to plug 10 into this one and this why these two hey they match up that's right there I mean that's exactly like what we have only there's a 10 that's exactly what we have only there's a 10 plug the 10 in and we can figure those two things out so the first one giv us our K squ we take here's how you plug it in 10 10 + 1 2 * 10 + 1 all over 6 that's from the first one then from the sum from 1 to 10 of K well we got another one for that we got n n + 1 over 2 so that's 10 10 + 1 / 2 that's that one why don't you all figure that out and see what we got okay go ahead and do that on your own do you guys understand where those numbers are coming from first of all this is kind of a basic concept just actually a little review concept so make sure you get it before we go any further what did you get 2 how much 275 275 43 oh my gosh oh my go I said gush that's how bad it is oh my gush 440 440 let's get a quintuple check on that how many people got 44 40 okay if you didn't get 440 hopefully you're wrong cuz that's what I'm putting on the board right now real answer is 440 is now the right answer it is now I'm not changing it hopefully you got right whatever SK 440 people home me me later feel okay with our Sigma notation how to manipulate it using our formulas those first three formulas those are the ones we use most often for us are there other ones yes but they get difficult um so we stick with those ones otherwise the math just gets kind of kind of tricky we have a lot more time so now we're going to start talking about how to actually find areas of of under the curve of some sort of function you got me remember how I introduced 4.1 I said there's there's two methods basically anti-derivative method which we've already conquered but we don't really understand fully trust me you don't uh because you don't know where it's coming from second method is the rectangular method it says how the anti-derivative method comes about I'll prove it to you why that comes about you ready yes so area yeah L thing in come of calculus theme music But realize it's already been done Empire Strikes Back so and everything comes back to Star Wars of course I'm going to try try to draw you some pretty pictures here but I'm not much of an artist unless it's boxes I can't do much with it let's say that we have some function f ofx I understand that I've given you this picture several times before but I really haven't explained how to do it very exactly to the point literally to the point on how to do it that's what I'm going to do today the idea that I gave you initially was what if we were to cut this space into n equal subsections the fact that it's equal just makes them easier for what we're going to do next that's that's what why why they're equal so basically we'd say okay I'm going to cut this into n equal subsection so right over here I'm going to make a little cut I'm going to go over the same distance and make a little cut then another distance make a little cut I'm going to do this until I get however far away to be so equal subsection I'm going to find out the the length and cut it into a certain number of subsections you got the idea this one will be our first cut x sub one then x sub 2 then x sub 3 x sub nus1 why n minus one because the next one would be at B that would be our last one x sub n be our last cut my question is can we find the width of each interval the with of each anable are you guys okay on the x sub one x sub 2 x sub 3 that's give us a certain number of cuts remember a loaf of bread says how much many times you cut it you get that many more sections so if I cut x sub n minus one times I'm going to get X subn actual rectangles you follow me on that so you slice bread right you cut it once you get two pieces cut it three times you get four pieces cut it X of n minus one we get X of n number of pieces X of n rectangles the last cut would be at B that's where it would be and that there's nothing past that so that would be the end our area did you follow now the width of each little interval we're going to call that Delta X like change in X Delta X would be the change from a to x sub 1 or or x sub 1 x sub 2 so we'll call the width Delta X how would you figure out the width of each of those things what would you need to know in order to figure out the width total you need to figure out total length so someone right hand side of the room how would you figure the total length from A to B total length how much I I need it in terms of what we have on the board already B A say it again B- a B minus a if this was 10 and that was three your length would be sure because you did 10 minus 3 right whatever this is minus whatever this is is going to give me my whole length of that area segment does that make sense to you are you sure now that's the overall length how do we find find the length of each little interval what do you think about that number sub divide by the number of subsections can you tell me how many subsections I have here I don't have infinite no no no this is finite number of cuts x sub nus one that's fin number n minus one is the number of cut remember we just talked about bread we just talked about bread right if you cut a loaf one slice how many pieces you get if you cut it three times how many pie you get if you cut it eight times how many pieces you get extrapolate that concept you cut x to the nus one how many pieces do you get n n do you understand we have n subsections here n literal intervals so if you take if you take the whole distance and you divide it by how many equal intervals you have that's a division problem that says that I should have B minus a Over N for my width of each little interval ra you understand that concept that's kind of a key one you understand where that's coming from are you sure guys over here yes all right now here's the idea we're going to make some rectangles out of this I introduced that idea already we're making rectangles we already have the bases of our rectangles we got this and this and this and this and they're all equal right that's going to make them very easy to add together later which is nice but what we've got to do is find out how tall our rectangles are how high they are because in order to find the area of a rectangle we're going to find the the base the base times whatever the height is right we need to find a way to find the height once we do that we'll have all these rectangles we'll add them together be very nice and easy but here's how we're going to find the height what you're going to do is you're going to pick an arbitrary Point arbitrary Point somewhere in this interval we'll call it let me write it down first pick an arbitrary Point what's arbitrary mean just random random you're going to find out that it's not going to make a difference at the end of our problem pick an arbitrary point for each sub interval bigger bigger is always better right so you can see it you okay with that here's what we're going to do pick an arbitrary Point some random point in between there now I got to explain to you why it doesn't have to be a specific point but why it could be a random point because as soon as I start stacking infinite number of rectangles in there as soon as I let my n Go to zero the width I'm sorry I'm sorry let my n Go to Infinity this distance becomes zero does that make sense n goes to Infinity number of rectangles go to Infinity the distance between them finite divided by Infinity goes to zero right goes to zero so that means that any point I pick is going to be really just squished it's going to be bound between two numbers that are different so it's going to be between there certainly between but it's not going to matter where it was because it's going to be Swit in there no matter what right it's like trying to put two hairs together and saying find the distance between them you always there's something in between them but it doesn't really matter because they're so thin anyway who cares so we'll pick some arbitrary Point let's call it l that arbitrary point we're going to call this x sub 1 dot yeah I know te yeah X1 dot but the dot stands for some arbitrary point doesn't matter where it is and here we'll pick X2 Dot and so on and so on and so on here's what we're going to do with X1 Dot and X2 Dot and so on and so on and so on we're going to take those values the the X values plug them into our function and that's going to give us the height at that exact point does that make sense to you so what we're basically doing is saying I want you to find the height here I want you to find the height here and I want you to find the height here at X3 Dot this one by the way would be xn dot not n minus one that's the previous one that's xn dot that says that you have n rectangles do you see what I'm talking about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 n at each of those points what we do is we say all right understand that this is the width of our rectangle right there if I go up from this arbitrary point it's going to give me the height of that rectangle do you follow that you build your rectangle around that okay that's going to be the height of my rectangle my next rectangle is going to have this height my next rectangle is going to have this height and you keep going all the way down the ne the last one would have this height so we pick an arbitrary point for each sub subsection and make a rectangle now I don't want to redraw this picture so I'm going to go one more step I'm going to show you why we do what we do okay cuz I don't want to redraw this I'm going to show you one exploded version of one of these rectangles understand that we can extrapolate and get this picture back from each one individually just by adding them together do you understand the concept of this first though cutting this into equal subsections find the height of each one at arbitrary point then to find the area we'll just add up the rectangles it will be an approximation for right now I'll show you how to make it better later here's the the each rectangle so the height of it each rectangle let's say I just take one of my rectangles my arbitrary point is any X whatever I'm talking about K dot X of one or two or three or four or five or n whatever that is dot next time when we start back we're going to start with this picture we're going to find out the width of each one which is already on the board we'll find out the height of each one therefore we'll be able to find the area since it's a rectangle add them all up together and you're going to see why we have the integral that we do uh from these areas did today make sense for you uh so we're we're right in the middle of trying to find the area under a curve and what we've realized is that this is the second rectangular method we're breaking up this area into equal width rectangles and then we're going to find the area of each rectangle add them all together that should give us at least an approximation for the area under under curve now it's going to be a little off because as you see we're Under and Over the curve at certain spot so this is going to be approximation to start with we'll talk about how to make it better later I think I gave you a preview on that last time what I've done here is I've taken one of our rectangles and we're going to try to find the area of one of these rectangles so notice that we we're somewhere Within A to B you follow me on that now I gave you some definition for the width of each of the rectangles last time how much do we call the width it was B minus a Over N that gave us the width of each one but we had a term for it Del Delta X that's the width of each sub interval did you follow me on that so this this width is Delta X of course it's important to have something that represents that because well we're going to take base times height to find the area of a rectangle so that's important now also we called this we had a point in here somewhere now this looks like a midpoint but it didn't have to be what was that point was it how do we find that point was it an arbitrary point it's some arbitrary Point arbitrary means it could be anywhere within that little sub interval and it has a DOT we call it x sub one or x sub 2 or x sub 3 whatever but a DOT meaning an arbitrary Point that's within that rectangle in in the the first rectangle or the second or whatever the indices say that's what we're in so if this is the since I'm being kind of generic here this is the Ki rectangle right whatever I'm talking about first second third fourth fifth k whatever this is the X subk dot that's the arbitrary point at somewhere in that rectangle you feel all right with that now how we use that arbitrary Point who just said well at that at that arbitrary point in my sub interval what I want to do I want to make my rectangle that height that way I can have at least some stopping point not always the left always it doesn't really matter where it's at but at at some point I'm going to make go up to the function and that's where I'm going to draw my top of my rectangle do you follow that well here's what we need to do now we need to come up with some way to find the area of a rectangle I just spoke about it but how do you find the area of a rectangle base times height base is done they're all going to be Delta X that's nice what's the height going to be the length would you agree it's the length of that right there where my arbitrary point is right because remember the arbitrary Point gave us the height and the height is based on the function so if this is is let's call this F ofx if that's F ofx how tall is that FX how would you find so some people I can tell you you're a little bit lost on this how could you find the height let's say that this point just happened to be 4 let's just pretend it was at xal 4 you would you'd plug in four plug in four to what so would you agree that if this was a four the height would be F of four right if that was a seven that'd be F of seven do you agree because F of whatever gives you the height of whatever this is our whatever XK dot so the height of this rectangle which means the height of this line is the height of the rectangle the height of this line is the function's height at that point the function's height at that point F of XK dot yes no yes yeah the guys over here okay so let's say this let's talk about the height of each rectangle since we already did this we know well the height of the first rectangle now this was every single rectangle we could think of right has this height what's going to be the height of the first rectangle well let's let's let's look at it it'd be F of X1 dot right whatever the first arbitrary point is we go up to to that height that's the height of the rectangle make sense that'd be the first first rectangle then the second one will be F of X2 Dot and then so on all the way when we get to f of x subn dot our last arbitrary Point that's somewhere between x sub n minus one and B the ending point oural so that would be our last arbitrary Point xn dot they give us n rectangles that's exactly what we want you sure you're still okay yeah now the fun part comes everything's going to make sense now oh this is so cool aren't you excited I'd be excited if I was in your shoes now I'm still excited and I know how to do this so that's pretty impressive you should be excited I'm building this up because it's going be very exciting exciting building up too much Ru the suspense area of a rectangle said this like three times now but the area of a rectangle is base time height well for each rectangle then let's look at the base times the height would you agree the base is Delta X for every single one of these rectangles so here here look here is the height of every rectangle right here's the base of every rectangle therefore the area of every rectangle would be f of x 1 dot * Delta X this is the area of the first rectangle that's what this is area of the first rectangle how about the area of the second one well it's still base times height how about the last one well it's still base times hyp you okay or not well what have we done really we've broken up it's it's actually basic geometry is what we've done uh we've broken up this curve this curve the area curve the interval into little equal rectangles right well actually segments for each segment we pick an arbitrary point at each arbitrary point we find the height and to find the area you multiply base times height and that's all we got base height base height base height for each individual rectangle now since this is the area of each individual rectangle from one through n and that encompasses all of them how do you find the area of the whole thing add them up so then area would be this we add the first one through the last one yes no okay cool well is there a better rep way to represent this this thing using or Su using or sum yeah using or sum how would we use our our sum is it going to be based on X or k what are we actually doing are we changing Delta X from rectangle to rectangle no that stays the same in fact if you wanted to factor it out you could really you could do that it's in each one of them some people do that to prove this but this is in every single one of them so that can't change does the F change does The X Change the index of the X changes the first one the second one the third one the fourth one so that's really the only thing we want to change where's the index start zero or one or two or three one where's the index n n at n so this area says I'm going to add up what am I adding up areas of rectangles going from let's call it K 1 to n do you know why we use K we use the same symbol that we use there that's X subk right that means each individual one we're just going to let this go from the first one to the second one to the third one to the nth one however many we have we say we don't want the have to change we definitely don't want the Delta X to change it's not what we're talking about what we really want to change is the index I need you to understand where this is coming from because if I I could have just given this to you right and said oh here's your area but that's pretty lame so here's what this says well you can probably figure it out what's this part Bas what's this part the height what's this do adds them up that's all it is height of each one because we're changing it right it's just a quick way to write this it's basically all we're doing what this is that's an approximation that's based on a finite number of rectangles did you agree because you have to have a finite number for n if you're going to actually do this in practical application well not practical application but if you're going to do this and separate into a certain number of rectangles you'd stop somewhere you'd say okay let's actually find this stuff out and you go from 1 to 5 or 1 to 50 or 1 to 100 so what this gives you is an approximation based on N so this is an approximation based on him how many rectangles you fit into that little space the more rectangles probably the better how can we make this better and better and better and better make it approach inity so basically make more rectangles right if you get more rectangles in a finite space if I only had two rectangles in the space and I had some curve probably not that great but if I had like 500 rectangles in this finite space probably better right if I had a billion probably better if I had close to Infinity of them probably the best we can get in fact it'd be so good there'd be no difference between the area of the curve and the my rectangles added together that's the concept of a limit haven't we covered the limit before it says if I let my n Go to Infinity if I let my n Go to Infinity that changes this from an approximation to an exact thing so how do we make it better I'll make it better I'll make it better that works for me actually I'm a math teacher I really don't care how make it better let N get bigger basically let N get as big as you can what that does is forces more rectangles into a space keep in mind that the rectangles are going to be the same width right so that means every time you force a new rectangle in it they all get narrower and narrower and narrower until they have virtually no width they have to have something because here's why they have to have something can you find the area of just a straight line no you have to have something don't you to find the area so you have to have a base but that Bas approaches approaches zero I'll make it better n goes to Infinity here's how we make it better for us we want n to go Infinity what's the only thing that lets us take n to Infinity Li we add limit that's that's how you find an exact area now I'll tell you a little secret this right here this is an integral here's why it's an integral a sum you see that the sum here when you take a sum to Infinity remember how I told you the the integral was elongated s that stands for that limit of a sum that's how you get that function that's some f ofx Delta X DX basically the same idea okay that's where the symbols are are kind of coming from you you the integral does mean a sum it means when you're adding up all the rectangles some function and that's a width of rectangle basically that that's you can translate that um so those two equations are the same that's what we're doing okay I just got for a second sorry yeah well remember we talked about integrals are anti-derivative they also mean the area of under a curve right this is the area under a curve this is how this is the they're the same construction the the difference is well you use different symbols instead of a limit of the sum and no you just call it integral it's it really is a sum that's a giant s it's it's called a sum uh the integral just means in the terms of a definite integral it just means you're you're actually finding the area so there's more a little more to it than that basically that's that's the idea now back to how to use that thing because you're going to have to do it you're going to have to use this to be able to find some areas would you like to see how yes we generally choose XK dot to be one of three places you can choose it to be anywhere arbitrary Point could be the far left of the sub interval could be like way over here it could be at the left could be the far right could be at the right could be the middle could be anywhere in there it doesn't matter why does it matter how wide is this getting to zero it's going to zero the width is going to zero that means no matter where your arbitrary point is it will be squished right it's basically just in the middle anyway so it doesn't really matter where it's at what we choose it to be is either the left for all of them the right for all of them or the middle for all of them that way we're more consistent and we can work a formula better does that make sense you don't want to pick arbitrary and have them all random because it's it'd be hard to do the next thing we're doing so in general we typically choose our XK Dot choose chose choose choo choo choose me choo choo get it we generally choose XK dot to be left end points right end points for midpoints of each sub interval for uh by the way your book has a tendency to call this um XK dot c subk as well so if you see the C subk we're talking about the same thing I prefer the XK dot I think it it looks better because you have in terms of X I like that better the book uses C subk so whenever you're reading it's a c subk mean XK dot they mean the arbitrary point point in there either left mid or right end points you follow me on that so when they you see C sub K that's what they're referring to is a left the mid or the right end points same thing we're going to be referring to now here's how to do it let me give you an example when you're talking about area you're talking about a finite thing right your area doesn't go on forever it starts and it stops somewhere starts at a it stops somewhere at B wherever B happens to be what we're doing here is we're starting to make Cuts wherever our Delta X's that's where we're making our cut so we'd make a cut here and a cut here and they're all equal and a cut here and a cut here and those cuts would be xub one and xub 2 and x sub3 and xub 4 and xub 5 and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on can you please tell me the distance here oh don't overthink it what's the what's the width of every single rectangle we have Delta X what's the width here oh good don't overthink it what's the width here very good within each of those cuts we would make a little arbit point right this would be like our x sub1 dot that would be the arbitrary point that we're talking about does that make sense and then here would be xub 2 Dot and so on and so on and so on so arbitrary points will be somewhere in there now here's the the point I'm trying to make your arbitrary points are either going to be look here your arbitrary points are either going to be your left end points that would be here and here and here and here and here see how we have each inter interval that would be the left end point starting here and here and here and here the right end points would say oh for each interval I'm going to start the right here and here and here and here and here does that make sense the midpoints would be kind of what this one looks like it would say here and here and here and here in the middle of each of our our little areas we only need one because no matter what we're going to go up to the function right and that's going to give us the height so for each interval you just need to be here or here or here that's typically what we do it could be anywhere but we choose lefts left left left we choose rights right right right or we choose mid right in the middle of it here's how you find out each one I'm hoping that you can walk through this with me and and understand where they're going let's talk about the left end points first then we'll do right end points and finally mid points so in each case we'll have an X dot by the way some of this might be a little vague to you in we actually do an example you see how to use xh dot but ultimately we're trying to do this look up here for a second we're trying to figure out a way to substitute this into this because we need to have some sort of expression that represents it right otherwise we can't plug it into our function and then we can we could do anything with it so we're ultimately trying to do that trying to get some expression for XK dot plug into our function after we plug into our function we'll have something in terms of x and and and and things like that and KS so and that's what we want because we need x's and KS to deal with our summation and we need that to deal with the limit so that's the whole idea here so far so good yeah okay very good so um let's talk about all these what are we going to let these things equal and we're talking about left right and midpoints respectively let's talk about end the left end points um where does this whole things start not at zero or anything like that at what a starts at a wherever a is that's where our interval is going to start agreed so each of these is going to have an A you know maybe I'll do the right end points first I think you'd probably understand that a little bit better we start at a let's say that I wanted my my end points to start at the right of each sub interval so for right end points for right end points do I want to start here for my very first one or here for my very first one this one so I'd have to add something to get from here to here what am I going to add it's already on the board what am I get to add okay so would you agree that to get to a right end point I'm going to add Delta X yes or no M so to get from here to here I don't want to start at a for right end points I don't want to start at a I want to start at X1 so I'd start at whever this is but plus Delta X right the next one how far now this is going to seem weird I'm going go back to here but how far away is the next end point from here two Delta X is away how about the next end point 3 Delta X and four and okay yes no yeah can you see how that works I've gone over your head some of you you need to stand up so I don't go over your head just kidding uh we're trying to find segments that are Delta X away right Delta X is the width if I'm talking about right end points I say how do I get from one place to the far end of a of a of my sub segment my sub interval well I'm going to add Delta X to it if I start off with with this plus Delta x * 1 because we start at one right that's going to give me this point then 2 3 4 5 six notice how I've gone 1 2 3 4 5 all the way to n and each of those will be the right the furthest most right point on each of our intervals yes or no yes okay that's for right end points let's talk about left end points left end points I want to slow this down by one because what I want to have happen is I want to start here right and then on my second one I want to be here does that make sense to you I hope I haven't lost you I really do right end points would be here right one right two right three you get it left end points that will be a plus Delta X for the first one a + 2 Delta X for the second one a + 3 Delta X for the third one a plus uh Del x * k for any of them that's right end points left end points would do this left one left two left three do you get that so what's going on I'm actually hitting pretty much the same exact values aren't I except I'm starting one earlier I'm starting at my a so I need to slow this one down by one if I slow this one down by one I'll have my left end points how do I slow this one down by one subtract Delta x with the same thing as subtracting one from K you have it right if I do that subtracting one from K so for instance how do I get to here I'm going to add basically I'm going to add zero Delta X's zero Delta X's that would be because we start at one Kus one you okay with that have I lost you notice that K always starts at one for us right K - 1 is 0 in this case so 1 - 1 is 0 0 * Delta x is 0 you would start at a you with me the next one would say okay plug in plug in uh two 2 - 1 is 1 you would have 1 Delta X away for your second end point Ah that's right there third fourth fifth so I basically just slowed it down by one you okay with that now the trickier one midpoints not really that bad not really this would be midpoint one midp point2 mid3 here's the question how much of Delta X am I I adding to get from here to here I'm adding half of it that's exactly what it is little bit weird though because uh you're going to take it say you've got to have the same Delta X right so you're going to have that subtract 1/2 from K and then multiply it so take 1 - 1/2 you get 1/2 you have adding half of Delta x 2 - 1/2 that's one and a half then multiply by Delta X and that's what you're doing here and that's the idea but you have the idea you had the idea basically down in fact you I think it might work a little bit better would you mind if I switch those around so instead of having Delta x k minus one I think I'd like to keep it kus1 Delta X I believe that's how perhaps your book has it K * Delta X and K 1 * Delta X by show hands how people understand the the end points and lastly you might also see this as C of K so note that that's the same thing is what we're talking about so when you see C subk that's the identical identical now would you finally like to see how this is put into practice would you sure I was hoping you would otherwise I I've got nothing so that's good my lesson would kind of fly you a little bit it's a good thing you want to know you understood the idea right Aries it's kind of cool it's an interesting idea isn't it to take all those make them really small add them together we have it we can do that now because we have this idea of a limit limit basically gives us the idea of calculus that's it that's I know you think it's a derivative but derivative is based on limits right and you think it's integral but integral is based on limits right yes that's all it is limits adding things together so let's see if we can add these things [Applause] together we'll start off kind of simply just so you get the idea of how to do this the process will be the same the uh as you guys have found out sometimes implementation is more difficult but the process is the same some problems are harder than other problems clearly but this one shouldn't be too bad to give us a nice understanding about what's going on here let's go ahead and find the area under F ofx = x^2 on 0 to 1 and what I'm going to in general in your real life you can pick whatever end points you want it really doesn't matter it will all work out the same what I'm going to tell you is in what end points to pick in this case I want you to pick right end points again it doesn't matter when you're taking a limit because n's going to Infinity it's all get squashed anyway I would say I would say it looks like right end points tend to be the easiest for me so I don't have to deal with this I don't have to deal with that to pick right end points ready to get down to it the first thing you do whenever you're doing this you have to have we're basically trying to fill this out so we're going to start on the right we'll work our way left you got to start and you got to know what Delta X is so Delta X recall that Delta X is what was how do we find Delta X B minus a over what okay so this is like step number one in our case Delta X by the way that was my fraternity so I always I always like writing that Delta Kai was the fraternity I was in so every time I write that I'm like no actually I don't even care but it's kind of fun I was in a fraternity that was your it we didn't call it Delta X it's Delta Kai Kai anyway fun times fun times uh what's B in this case how are you getting the one this is B minus a yeah that's right uh the interval tells you A and B right so where you start is a where you stop is B where do we stop one minus what is your a I need more than this guys more than this come on yall should be participating here if you don't see where it's coming from tell me that's fine but don't just sit there Sil do you see where the B's coming from you see where the A's coming from okay what's the N I don't know we can't do that because we're letting n Go to Infinity later so we don't know what n is I'm not telling you five or six we want better than that we don't want approximations we want exactness so we need to have an N up there do you feel okay that this is going to equal 1/ y or no okay cool the next thing you have to do is you have to come with some representation of your XK dot you need that because we have now our Delta X that's great one we now need our XK dot XK dot oh let's do the XK dot I said left right or mid which are we doing so you'd you'd go over here you'd find which one is appropriate for you based on what the problem is telling you to do sometimes in your book you'll get mid sometimes left this case I'm giving you right so we're going to do this exact same thing so in our case because we're right not all the time but because we're right end points we've got a plus K Delta X by the way this order is non-negotiable you have to go in this order you'll see why right now so for us XK dot equals uh how much is a zero zero is not Z plus do I have anything up here that says K in it do I do I have any any numbers for k then leave it K times oh that's a Delta X have you found out what Delta X is yet that's why you have to do it first because you're going to be using it in your next step anywhere you're going to be using Delta X it was 1 n which means for us that we're going to get k n by the way this becomes fairly harder when you don't have a zero okay fairly harder if you have a zero it's kind of nice why well we add zero to anything gives you anything but the next step means that having a number over here could potentially make it a lot harder because the next thing we're going to do we have our Delta X right we actually used it we have our XK dot yes what does f of XK dot mean put that into a function you plug it in to the function so so step number three says I want F of XK dot in our case that's this folks look go slowly what was showing me every step that's F of what is XK dot for us ladies and gentlemen what is f f of XK dot k Over N so we're going to take F of K Over N oh my goodness how do you take F of something what if that was F of five just you should be able to tell me right now if that was F of five what you would have 25 how are you getting 25 that's because it's F so take this plug it in that's a composition substitution so this says you're going to take whatever's in here and based on our function you're going to square it do you now see why if you had a constant up there it might make things a lot hard yeah if you have to square something with a number that's distribution if you have to cube something with a number that's a lot of distribution that's a pain right good thing we have integrals because we we I just told you ahead of time that this translates into an integral so we can do this uh but this is the idea on how it works this is it are we are we going to see doing this mainly through integrals and we're just proving integral or is this way we solving you're going to be solving with this for right now we'll translate to a definite integral later okay for right now you kind of need this concept now are you okay with this so far as soon as you have your Delta X great you can find your XK dot no problem as soon you find your XK dot okay you can find your F of XK dot now the last thing we're going to do take all this stuff put it right up there and we'll have enough to do our integral I'm sorry our limit of our summation you ready for it no can you make it down this far yes it's not too bad really just follow steps one two three step number four important step you don't worry about the limit yet don't worry about that not yet you're welcome fill this whole thing out if you fill that whole thing out you can't change the sum however you do have expressions for this and for this what did we find out was our F of XK dot all said and done what was it K Over N what okay and we also should have an expression for our Delta x what was our expression for Delta X one over N I hope one over n for Delta X One n I need to show hands if you see where those things are coming from okay it's still another substitution but now we're we're pretty much good to go what we're going to do you you'll have practiced this by the way uh on some of your 4.3 homework what you're going to do get rid of that square work this thing down make it look nice how do we make it look nice well you use those properties that I told you last time here's the properties I told you last time these are these are important ones the important properties are you can pull out any constants that you want a constant is defined as not being your index your index is K's K's I don't care about the N K's you got me means you get to pull out x's and anything else that's not a k and you can separate by addition subtraction that's the only two that you get to deal with so in our case what's nice about this is which one of these after we do the next step you you'll see it which one of these things when I write this as k^ 2 over n Cub which one of these things can I pull out the K2 or the N Cub or either or neither or both can I pull out the case the case the K has to do with my index I can't touch that can't touch this okay I don't I'm not wearing my hammer pants but that's the song um are you guys too young for MC Hammer no I'm not sweet now n Cub now I'm only 21 so I'm a little young for that the N Cub that does not deal with K we're talking about that K right there not that n everything's going to n that you can pull out is it n Cub or one over n Cub can somebody please tell me why we did this why in the world do we do this does this look familiar yeah that's why we did that notice what we this is kind of crazy but we've changed this entire ugly nasty weird thing into ah nice you have a formula for that in fact the formula for that do you remember um something over is [Music] N I didn't hear a word of that but I'm just going to do it on my own uh the one/ N Cub stays the same I was focus on something else times the summation from 1 to n you have this in your book I've given it to you before I think you were probably right if you just read it off that it's n n + 1 2 n + 1 all over 6 why is it nice that we could pull this N Out well look at that that's the same exact end right same n that's great that's so convenient for us what are you going to do now probably make it a little bit prettier I would say um I would say that this is being multiplied so I know I can eliminate that n and make that a two right could do that before you start Distributing you might want to do things like that right that that that'd be a lot better are you still okay so far how do you feel just fine with with this thus far now you'd probably distribute why just go ahead and do that I hope I'm right am I right yeah I love being right that's great did you get the same thing yeah now those of you who have been paying attention up here what's the one thing that we haven't done yet limit the limit oh we've done this we've done this we've done this in fact this is this that's what that is right that's what we've done so far it doesn't look like it because we used our our formula that's great it's kind of nice we haven't done this so before you start writing an a we're not at the a yet here's the fifth and final step take a limit as n goes to Infinity that's it notice the variable we ended with that's kind of cool we want n to go Infinity what's the only variable we have fantastic that's great why is that going to happen because you're actually going to Numbers if you're going to numbers you need to end with a number right if there was X's up here or anything yeah that you'd have X's within your problem but we don't we're going from Z to one that's called a definite integral you get a number so we'll take a limit as n goes to infinity and if you remember anything about limits which is why we did this it was just a little while ago 2 n^2 + 3 n + 1 over 6 n^2 some of these basic polinomial types are very easy to find a limit of when we go n to Infinity what do we do what was the idea largest power largest power in the denominator and you divide everything by it right in other words you look at the leading coefficients the leading coefficients are the coefficients of the terms of largest power so leading coefficients here are two and six respectively notice how the powers match up if you divide everything by X squ the only things you're going left with are two and six and everything else is going to go to zero I'll show you that step right now but basically I know this area is 1/3 right now 2 over 6 is 1/3 here's the work that you would show you'd say okay that's a limit that over n s that over n 2 that over n s and 6 N2 n 2 do you remember me teaching that from a while back and what we do is we simplify what we can these n squs are gone these n squ are gone but this one's not that just becomes an N so this is the limit of 2 + 3 n + 1 n 2 all over six tell me what happens when you let N Go to Infinity does the two change no does the six change what's this become zero and perfect that means the area because that's our definition for an area is 2 + 0 + 0/ 6 or in other words the area is 13 and that's how you can find area in curve we just completed the whole process right here folks we have functions we find rectangles you use right end points or left or midpoints use a limit on them I've given you every step now right you have five steps I I hope that's clear for you keep in mind that on your homework on your homework this is often called C subk you can you can call it c subk as well that just means an actual value within your interval that's some solid number that you're plugging in is that it good afternoon hope you're doing well we're going to continue talking about how to find areas using these limits and basically by adding up rectangles however before we get on to another example I do want to discuss what it is we're actually doing what we're doing is we're figuring out something called net signed area we are actually not calculating total area right here we're calculating something called net signed area would you like me to explain the difference yes here's what net signed area says before every function we've had till right now figuring out the area has been completely above the x-axis you might not have realized that but we haven't had one that's below the x-axis here's what net signed area says if I have this curve and let's pretend that the horizontal is the x-axis how many areas do I have distinct areas there would be three between the the function and the x-axis there's area one area 2 and area three here's what net signed area says it says the area that's above the x-axis counts as positive area area below the x-axis counts as negative area that's just how this area Works says this would all be a positive area and a positive area but this would have a negative area now in order to figure out total area I'm going to show you how to do that in a couple more lessons but right now just know that when we're calculating area from one point to another it is including this as being positive this as being positive and this it would count as a negative area it would subtract from the two positive areas are are you following me on that so the area you you get with with with doing this method even if it doesn't even if you don't have a graph of it even you don't know what it looks like here's what it's doing it's saying the total area is the positive areas minus the negative area or take time sorry the POS the area above the x-axis and taking away the area below the x-axis that's what that actually means it's basically the difference between the areas above and below the x-axis the difference between the areas above cumulatively and areas below cumulatively of the x-axis is symmetry a factor not really you can't I guess it could be it's found exactly the same way so the the area formula I created with you guys remember the area formula I created with you guys hopefully you've been using that it's the limit with that sum that that doesn't change this is when I said area what I meant was net signed area I didn't mean total area well we'll talk about that later so when you're calcula area like this which is basically what we've been doing for the past couple days also for those of you who have been doing your homework do you realize that this is in the book represented as C subk you've seen that as well right it means the same thing right so I could use that interchangeably that is net signed area what we've been doing is net signed area let me show you an example of this so you can kind of get an illustration of what I'm talking about would you like to see that we're going to do one kind of quickly we're going to go through very fast because the the process doesn't change but I want to show you at least uh one time okay we're going to find the area of f ofx under f ofx equals what I say x - one on the interval 02 with left end points that's what we're going to do hey what's the first step I think I gave it to you first step number one Delta X okay let's find Delta X so I'm outline all the steps for you just like you did before so Delta X in our case Delta X is how do you find Delta X come on people help me out 2 - 0 Over N it should have an n in it 2 N that's always your first step you got to have that before you go any further because the next step uses Delta X the next step is you got to find C subk or XK dot whatever ever notation you prefer I don't care how you do it I've called it XK dot in the previous lessons uh the book will call it C subk would you like me use C subk so you kind of see that okay I'll use C subk if You' like so the next is find C subk left using left end points C subk says this a + K-1 Delta X that's what C subk would say for you didn't I give you those formulas last time yeah okay so you look up the correct end point whether it's whether it's a left or right or perhaps a midpoint and you use the appropriate formula you with me then you fill out everything that doesn't have a k the K is going to stay there's nothing you plug in for K you're going to use that because your summation is using k okay minus one Whatever U so in our case C subk is what's your a a is where you start what's your a folks come on plus what do I plug in for that K nothing you're going to use that later on because you're going to be basing your summation notation on your K right you'll have a formula for that later it has to have a K well not have to but it's most likely going to have a k K minus one now your Delta X this is why we did this Delta X is 2 N so C sub k z zero does nothing you have 2K minus one don't distribute Over N don't distribute and I'll tell you why later you're just going to have to reactor out anyway if you do distribute where your feel okay with this so far good deal basic basic right now uh what's step number three come on on Roll fun C sure or XK dot which is what we used before to show the arbitrary point I like the XK dot because it means arbitrary that's why I showed it to you initially but the C subk says the same thing it says uh can you find out using our arbitrary Point what the function is going to look like what is the function ladies and gentlemen no the function xus one so I'm supposed to take C sub K and plug it into that you with me that says F of 2 K -1 / n which means that I'm going to have well if our function is x -1 it says 2 K -1/ N - one would you or feel okay with that so far I guess you could have distributed we might do that now there's a couple ways we could do this problem uh if you'd like probably the easiest way we combine everything right now get one fraction out of it so what's the next step after that after we find our function do what no aha right now we have this this okay we've got our function the next step step number four is you're supposed to put this in your summation right 1 to n you're supposed to make that you're supposed to say okay I know my Delta X I can plug it in I now have my f c subk I can plug that in and then we'll take the summation try to work that on out and see what we get out of it n help you're okay with that one let's plug that in together what goes in place of the F of C what is your mumblings what are you saying function of C K very good yes the function of C sub K come on letter it's right there sure just like that parentheses parenthesis is good we need that yes you don't want to miss your Delta X that's important especially for us our Delta X is 2 n would you ra your hand feel okay with this so far so far yes everybody so you're okay that where we got the Delta X right b - A Over N that's just going to be 2 N you okay with the c subk that's XK dot the same thing that means you're going to use a formula there it's going to be either left right or mid we have left in this case that's why we use this formula remember the right would have no minus one the mid would have minus one2 and you do the same exact thing we figured that out by inserting our Delta X then we take this value our C subk to plug it into our function that's right here and we're going to get this minus one for our function of C subk that's why we have that right there that's where the minus one's coming from it's not magic it's because I have X that treat that's my treated my as my x minus one got it then we plug everything in we got our function of C subk oh that's here times our Delta X we got our Delta X from right there and now we're good to go what now well now you work with it now you do some algebra probably have to distribute that you do have to distribute this one so we're going to get stick with me here folks 4 kus1 over n^ 2 - 2/ n are you okay with that at this point you have well next one's not an option but the one after that you're going to have an option the next thing you do is you break up those two sums do you see how can break up the sums by subtraction that's always legal with subtraction and addition so here you'd go okay summation notation K = 1 to n this minus this are you still okay so far you sure at this point you do have options your options are this you could distribute the four you could distribute the four and then separate those fractions and make two more sums you could do that that's option number one that's a decent option option number two is notice how this and this are not based on K you can pull those out and then you could separate the K minus one you could do that as well just make sure that you have a bracket around the whole thing that way you don't miss anything about it are you seeing what I'm talking about here so that options up to you which what do you want to do do you want to distribute right now or would you rather pull this stuff out if you want to break it up why don't you try some of you who who feel like Distributing and then breaking it up go ahead and do that you pull this out yeah okay we could do that too that's probably the way I'll choose to do so I'm going to look at this one I'm going say all right well I know this is 4 over n^2 and right here I'm going to put a bracket around so I don't forget I can't forget that I'm going to group that to say yes that's sum of that whole thing still minus oh well wait wait a second how about that what can I pull out of the 2 over n say what what about the two two out two now can you combine the two in you pulled out four and two you'd Factor it it get pretty messy I would wouldn't recommend that okay because this is different you can't combine that right now can you make it that far though algebraically the next part is make your sums something you can do with this is not something you can do deal with right here but if you split that up notice how we're going to keep it inside the bracket you see why we're going to keep it inside the bracket because ultimately our answer is going to get multiplied by 4 n^2 yes so we're going to we're going to have that we'll have the summation of K of course K's going from 1 to n minus the summation of one from 1 to n it's in a bracket you have to have it mine is the same thing I haven't changed that at all but now's the good part now's the part where you actually get to do some nice stuff you ready to do some nice stuff with it we it's time to get rid of all those summations because we don't we don't like those those we have formulas for you ready to deal with the formulas for those you sure M real quick though how many people feel okay with with this so far feel just fine with it so you see where all this stuff is coming from that's great that's great okay now have you memorized or do you know the formula for sum of K [Music] sure all the mumbling hopefully made over two good job yeah I think I heard most of what you said that's that that is this minus it's still in a bracket what's this we talked about that only one time constant time n which would be what just n in this case minus two okay 2 over n times how much is this one n n yeah n that's why by the way it's in your in your notation it says sum of C is CN because you always pull the C out right the summation one is always just n that's why it's CN so this is going to be N I do it that way cuz it's kind of nice you can see what's going to happen with that you still all right let's keep going let's do some fancy math uh easy part I'll do this one for you I'll tell you what the n and the end here I get to cross those out cool right done that's nice what's going to happen with this whole garbage we distribute that if I distribute that back in there but I needed to I needed to factor it out to get my summation notation okay but now I need to distribute it back in if we had split this up we probably wouldn't have to distribute that back in so it's it's up to you what you want to do with that uh but notice how if we would have distributed here split our fractions then pulled things out of each individual sum there'd be no need for distribution later do you see the difference in that problem so it's it's six to one half dozen to other it really doesn't matter matter what you do you're going to have to factor and distribute in both cases so here we'll get we'll get what okay let me do this a couple steps because I'm thinking you're you're going too fast for me how about that does that work for you yes no I haven't I haven't simplified anything yet except for these two ends is that okay are you sure I'm getting nothing I need more than this guys I need yeses or NOS that's the only way I know how to teach I need M or not okay that doesn't work do you get it or not if you don't that's not a problem you just need to let me know now let's simplify some other stuff tell me something that simplifies here okay cool so the two and the four those simplify the n and one of those n's simplify what simplifies here is an N with the square part of that so I get 2 n + 1/ N - 4 n - 2 we're almost done almost done you ready for it now we'll distribute the two we'll get 2 n + 2 and I'm also going to break it up 2 n + 2 and then I split the fraction up 2 N / n + 2 N yes no just some basic algebra but I want to make sure you're really solid on this before you go any further are you really Sol on that mhm what's nice about this we're going to get that's going to be two got it man we're almost done why don't you tell me the next thing I'm going to have up here oh come on what's the next thing that happens you see something up here two positive2 and your oh so two and -2 oh I made a mistake why did you let me do that oh I was wondering what you were talking about okay what is this at anyway the twos are gone uh we have 2 N - 4n you okay with the 2 N - 4n right now what do you do when you have made it down that far you have step number five what are you supposed to do now a limit of the whole darn thing so right here we found the sum we know what that is now you take a limit as n goes to Infinity of whatever sum you had we've already worked this part down we you already have it this part is 2 N - 4 n i could you have it doesn't really matter we can yes absolutely yes you're right for sure I just didn't see it because I know what the answer is going to be are you okay getting that far then yes we have a -2 n yes yes now you take a limit as n goes to what this is very simple when when n goes to Infinity where does that go zero it's weird you mean the area is zero yes negative area here your you need to think about what this is this was a lot of work for something very very simple honestly it was you're going to see this if you didn't really picture what this graph is beforehand you will now uh this says Y intercept 1 the slope is one and you're going from 0 to two that's your picture yes it's just two triangles 0 to two why did our area go out to zero this is positive whatever this is negative but it's the same exact value only negative in fact it was two and -2 you know how I know that well you could or look here this is positive area this is subtrac the area this par that's going to give you a zero these ones go to zero because you're div you're divided by Infinity it goes to zero gone there's totally a simplified version no power R go through all the mess and power R never do you understand the reason why this is zero ladies and gentlemen do you see why the areas are both on the numerator and denominator of your whatever actually it's not two is it it's 1 * 1 over it's 1 12 I don't know why I get uh but the area here if you did the if you actually did the work base times height over two I think I said two I meant 1 12 it doesn't quite match up to that apparently that's one that's one so 1 * 1 is 1/ two base time side number two you get one half above you get one half below that's what makes it zero you okay with it yeah sounds cool shall we do one more yes the worst I can think of so far yeah there's worst ones on your homework know that but think it's so far here it is you'll get inspiration after you see our homework yeah you're inspired by terrible going to the next next semester's class probably harder they do yeah they do do they really that's no not really not anymore they used to though I kept seeing stupid mistakes you guys gotta be freaking kidding me I want to punch you more so make them harder harder I wish I could take this class the firster it's very easy in high school you know there can only be one there could be only one Highlander oh yeah I should just say go do it have fun but we'll do it together so you can see it but you need to be a participating you need you need to basically be able to tell me what to do because when you get this on your test and you will uh you'll need to know how to do it right and if it makes sense what I'm doing of course it does I'm the teacher I know what I'm doing most of the time uh so it's going to make I do it's going to make sense when I do it but when you go home you need to practice that's why when you skip your your homework or you skip pieces of your homework it kills you because you get to the test you got to realize there's only 10 12 problems on the test right we have like five to six homework assignments usually so that's one to two problems on the test that come from your homework so if you miss a homework you miss one to two problems or at least you haven't practiced them that's why your grades go down so you need to practice it even though it's hard practice it now we're going to go through every step I've given you five steps for reason so that you follow them step number one is what Delta Delta yall should find it right now Delta X is refreshingly easy always it's a subtraction over a number so in our case you get 1 - 0/ n 1 over n did you get 1 over n as well yes okay what's the next thing that you do find C okay go ahead and do that we're using right and points did you find c k already yes it should go pretty quick this is not one of those hard ones either you plug in a number for a you plug in nothing for K you plug in Delta X X zero K one did you get that too so you got K over did you get K Over N do you see why right end points are kind of nice sometimes to use because you don't have the K minus one you don't have the oneus one2 that's even nastier so right I like right end points first K Over N satisfied so far what's the next thing that you do function okay do [Applause] it find the function I'll give you a minute for that one by show hands how many people made it that far am I right oh good then you're all right that's that's fantastic if you made it that far and I made it that far we hopefully we both did right did you get that as well cool what would have made it worse what type of endo would have really made it worse left ones would have made it worse midp points would have made it worse too because you'd be cubing K minus one not horribly horribly bad but you'd have more things to deal with that's why this was such a pain because you had this mess right that mess kind of stunk it up a little bit not hard not hard just more work you also Dobe from right here well I'm saying if I had that okay okay that would have made it worse is we were talking about what would have made it worse than this a left end point or a midpoint would have made this problem a lot harder are you okay with that one so far what's the next step you do do the sum do the Sun I don't want to write up there until you at least have something on your paper so go for the s you probably should have a bracket if you don't have one put one on your paper get in the habit of doing that because you're not just multiplying this last little bit you're multiplying the whole thing by Delta X whatever the Delta X happens to be in our case it's k oh one over so geez shoot you know I looked right there I'm Sorry by the way uh I just meant to do this to test you you guys are oh yeah buy you're not buying that you always do darn it I'm so good at doing that though yeah I see it every time yeah okay one of R yeah my bad I was kind of looking at that wondering how are we going to deal with the K to the fourth but n sure we would have dealt it at some point anyway do you feel okay with it so far raise your hand feel just fine with it you have that on your paper exactly like that cool now what probably make it a lot prettier before you can split anything you have to deal with this multiplication distri you can't split this up right now it's being multiplied so you have to distribute that you have to think about this as K Cub Over N Cub So eventually you'll split it off you have to move this two to the top or take that completely out later I'd probably move it to the numerator right right now just to be able to deal with it a little bit easier so I'm going to multiply by 2 that's 2K n I'm going to multiply by 1/ n to both of those and I'm going to make that K Cub M Cub that's our next three steps is it okay if we had already done that step previously over here yeah did the two two and Decay and then cubed everything much earlier and just kept pairing it out that way so I've made things nicer inside now I'll distribute that one/ n and what we'll get is 2K over n^ 2us K Cub Over N 4th and that should be in a parentheses signifying that I'm taking the sum of that entire expression not just the first part not just second part the whole thing okay now what would you like to do now you split it up you can't pull out any case yet you can't unless you you factored you could do that but that's probably not the easiest way to go what we should do here is split these up into two different sums and then pull out all the constants are you following me or not you sure remember this this is easy cuz I'm doing it when you get home you need to follow the same steps why don't you go ahead and try to do the rest of this on your own what I'd like you to do is take out everything that doesn't have to do with a K in front of your summation use the appropriate formula that I've given you from before figure out that that closed form and then simplify it after you simplified as much as you can then take a limit I'll give you about two minutes to see if you can work on it I'll do about one step every 10 or 20 seconds or so just make sure you're on the right track so look up here at the board every once in a while and you'll start seeing the steps for this is you make it that far on your own simplifying the first one squaring everything inside the parentheses the second one multiplying by 1 n 4th you make it that far yes no is do second part did I mess the formula up I thought that formula right there I don't believe so unless my mind's completely flipped off out and i' I've lost flipped off my mind's flipped off it is flipped off today I don't know no I think I believe it's squared n * n+ 1 over2 quanti squared should be the formula I gave you if you have a cubed you might want to change it back it's not cubed satisfied so far some of you look lost algebraically are you okay I'm going to keep going how do you get four why did you get n+ one over four and not n plus one over n oh this one yeah I was testing you you passed okay that's two CU I saw that four and that's what I did yeah thank you I'm sorry about that guys my bad yeah good catch thank you that's why I ask you CU I do this stuff too is everything else right check out okay please notice something that's going to happen here the algebra we're subtracting the that entire last fraction right so when you subtract the entire last fraction and you split it up it's not going to be plus 2 n/ 4N s it's going to be minus 2 N 4N s you see that this will find necessity to distribute when you split that up it has to so you're going to get - 2 n/ 4 n^ 2 - 1 4 do you see why do you see why yes or no for instance then I can show it to you this way if you want uh 5 - 1 + 3/x like that would be 5 - 1x + 3x right like that that's what that means me so this would distribute to both of that's same thing we're just using it three times here okay let's simplify unless I've made some sort of error I think that's about what you get was anyone able to make it down that far on their own good good if not where did you make your mistake find out was it a sign was it simplification this is all about your algebra notice we basically stopped to doing the calculus after that part finding the formula and then this is all just some basic algebra now comes back in the calculus once you get this right we're going to take a limit that's the last thing we'll do so step number five write right here it's already nice and broken down for us that's what's great about this we didn't have to find a common denom and divide everything by the largest power of the denominator you can do it that way it's a little bit more concise this says all right the area not an approximation anymore the actual area because we're taking n to Infinity that says pack is many rectangles as is possible and then some into that area that means there's not going to be any error whatsoever you're gonna get what what what's this go to Z this one that's a constant what's this one go to what's this one go to this one this one how much that's what we're talking about so we don't have to rec combine all of our fractions heck no no why would you ever do that oh my gosh no I guess yes cuz I hate myself on the homework cuz you hate yourself on the homework cuz you want to waste time take your limit then if you have to do it combine them you don't have to this is so nice some a number over n that works out very nicely for you right so use it shoot why not why not do it that way under what circumstances have I can't think of one okay so don't do it well the only time you you would is like uh for some reason if you wanted to combine these and make a common not or if you didn't want to split this up you could do it here okay minus the limit of this divide all this by N2 and then you can do the same thing there that's fine I don't care how you do it I'm just showing you that you can split it up it's it comes out very nicely then you have less work to do on your actual limit the more you split up like this and have one term it comes out just piece of cake no work on the limit more work on the algebra or less work on the algebra more work on the limit either way you go you're going to get it right provided you know how to work with this appropriately the correct sign and you also know how to do your liit good you raise your have feel okay with getting the three4 there all right 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 4.4:  The Evaluation of Definite Integrals
now the next thing we're going to talk about it it's honestly going to take me about 2 minutes to really go over it uh then we'll start start practicing it later but what we're going to do is make the transition from here to integrals here's what you need to know it's what I've already told you but I'll reiterate it oops what we're going to talk about is the definite integral these these things before the integrals you were doing were called indefinite they had a plus c because you weren't quite sure about the area it was an area function but you didn't know what the area was now we're going to be able to find the area wait for it there we go here it is again last time I'll show it to you area right now you know area as this you know area is that right on some interval a to there's another interpretation for it it's very very similar to saying this remember how you calculated derivatives with limits and then we found a pattern for derivatives and you said to heck with these limit things this is easy I like this right derivatives are great because they don't deal with limits which is in fact a fallacy because derivatives are all about limits you just don't expressly calculate the limit you understand same thing with an integral an integral is all about limits just like this this is called a ran sum or Ryman sum however you pronounce his name incorrectly that's what most people say uh is the remon sum is taking all those rectangles and adding them up together that's why it's called a sum it doesn't really matter where that point is we typically use left right or midpoints but it doesn't matter it's an arbitrary Point what that says is that when I add up all these these rectangles I do basically the same thing going from a a limit using a derivative using limits to a derivative using the shortcuts that we basically do and that's what we can do here as well we say you know what the notation here really meshes up very nicely I've showed this to you one of the time but now I'll show you exactly what we're going to have on top of this when you take a a limit of a sum you basically add an infinite number of rectangles adding an infinite number of rectangles is denoted with this that's an integral adding an infinite number of rectangles based on some function in terms of X where does the C subk go we're not talking about a specific point we're talking about any arbitrary point that goes throughout the entire span of your your x's on an infinite number of of inter sub intervals and it's based on whatever variable you're talking about DX the width of each rectangle if the width of each each rectangle goes to zero because n goes to Infinity that becomes that idea of a limit limiting the x width that zero remember with with our derivative we took the x distance and we made it zero do you remember that and we taking the distance between two points and making it zero and that's what we're doing here the same EXA idea only now we're adding together a whole bunch of little bitty rectangles instead of finding uh slopes between two little tiny points you get it that's the idea now where's the A and the B come in here's where the A and the B come in on an interval A to B on interval A to B this says this basically add up all the rectangles with the height of f ofx that have a width of a very infinitely small value from your starting point a to your ending point of B can you already do integrals awesome I'm going to show you next probably next time in the time after that how to deal with this it's not hard I think you'll really enjoy it okay so we are still learning about something called the definite integral and our idea was that we can basically do well the idea was we had a summation right we took a limit of it that was the area we also made that into this integral and said well what the integral stands for is basically a limit of a sum it's adding up all the rectangles where the partitions are actually you know what for that to work I have to make the statement I got a qualified a little bit you know how we made equal partitions those don't have to be equal you know how we made left end points and right end points and midp points they didn't have to be there they could be any point within any type of partition that you wanted to make because as soon as you make the number of rectangles go to Infinity those all no matter what the size they all go close to zero does that make sense even though some are closer than others doesn't matter they're all going to zero anyway so it doesn't even matter they were equal we did that for the sake of making it easy on us uh but this is what this means it means adding up some all the little rectangles no matter what their size is as we go the number of rectangles to Infinity so basically this is a limit of a sum and I told you where that comes from that's like the Delta X so this is the same thing we had before which was called net signed area this is net signed area so basically this is this and this is what you've been doing your whole like a lot right aren't you glad I started you at like whatever I started you at you did it my way right the way I showed you hope so did it my way a a lot of effort not a lot of results now before I tell you how to actually compute these with very little problems because you basically already know I'm going to show you geometrically what this means okay I give you just three examples on on what exactly we are doing here so when we talk about geometrically what this represents let's talk about the integral from 1 to 4 of 2 DX now firstly can you tell me what the bounds of this integration is okay so X should start at one and end at four that's where our area starts and stops what's our function can you graph two what what is it straight line very good straight line or straight line straight so basically horizontal lines what you you probably mean by that and it's not this way it's this way yeah so this is our our two our yal 2 or f ofx = 2 and we're going from 1 to 4 this folks is what this integral represents it's this area right here that's what that is now for constants that's pretty easy right it just says oh we have this this horizontal line we're going from one spot to another let's actually calculate the area geometrically what's our our base good 1 to four gives you a three what's our height so what's the area here's what I know right now this integral is equal to six square units whatever the units are but it's an area that's what this talks about it says look you can even partition of it no matter what you do you add up the areas of those rectangles it's going to equal six you got me that's what we're talking about let's talk about a couple more let's do uh let's do this one how about x+2 could you graph X+ 2 hope so so X+ 2 says I'm going to start at 2 my slope is one so this is going to give me that line and I'm going to go from1 to two and this is the area that I would like to represent is the area of this region how do you find area of that region could you do it geometrically could you do it how might you how much you do it it up a triangle probably a triangle and a rectangle is how I would do that so maybe break this one off right here you okay with that let's find the area what's the area of this rectangle down here how are you getting three so a AE base of three a height of one so the purple area is three okay very good how about the area of this this region let's do it in blue what's the base of our our triangle what's the height sure and we divide by two so the area is also What's the total area by the way total area does always equal six just so you know just so you know the area everything is six just put six no we did something wrong here folks the height is not that three times sorry my it's not the scale but we did something wrong uh this is actually Four so 3 * 3 What Now 3 * 3 * 3 over two N9 Hales if we want to add those together we'd get 9es plus three Hales is going to be 15es you okay with the 15 Hales sorry about that one yet it is 3 * 3 15 hves we just you're just proving that not all areas equal six yes that's what I was doing that's what I was doing I knew something didn't add up right but uh my DOT was uh not exactly in the right spot how many people feel okay with our area So Far So geometrically speaking this is not so bad rectangle rectangle with a triangle as long as we calculate our height right we can do that base times height over two what about something like this one this is going to look nasty until you really think about what's going on how about that one what what's it mean what's it mean what does an integral stand for you guys over here asleep come on integral integral come on integral what's a definite integral what are we doing here areas that's what we're talking about we're find the area of whatever this function is whatever that function is whatever this function is now I think Michael might have said it but what is this function oh it's not quite a circle it's a half circle is the top or the bottom bottom negative would be the bottom there go this would be the that's the top of the circle a circle is plus and minus sare root of radius minus radius s- X so this is the top half of a circle that's a radius of one a radius of one very good radius of one that right there you okay with this so far you sure so this right here is that hey tell me someone the left hand side of the room what are my bounds of integration where am I starting and where am I stopping no zero read my integral read my integral see my integral doesn't always say start where my function starts and end where my function ends this actually says start here and there just like we did over here start here and here so basically quarter we have a quarter of a circle we have a quarter of a circle with what type of a radius how much is the radius here can you find the area of a circle area Circle what's the formula for area circle come on now R 2 what y * 1/4 this would be the whole circle we're taking a four of it so this is basically a quarter circle with a radius of one which is interesting right without even having to calculate these integrals we're able to find some of those areas we're able to do them we didn't do anything about those integrals but the idea is what you're doing is finding areas there's a geometrical approach to it if you can do the basic geometry you can do some of these integrals now of course do we always have basic geometry to do yes you would like to hope so have my fingers crossed no but if I give you something like uh X cubed there's no basic geometry with that X squ there's no basic geometry with that so we do have to have a better way and we had the the remon sums or those those limits of summations we did those that was one way what we're going to do now is think about maybe a better way to do that a faster way to do that there is no better way it's the same way it's just a short cuts about that just like how with derivatives I gave you limits first and then I gave you a quick and dirty way to do it quick and clean it's kind of nice pretty cool do you feel okay with this uh area approach to begin with can you always do it no but you you're going to practice some of this on your homework be able to break up a rectangle rectangular triangle some circle ideas now before we do go further I have to give you some properties things we can and can't do with these integrals so properties number one property okay think through this than think about this yeah exactly what's the are remember an integral is an area an integral is an area what's the area why what's the area under a single point there is zero the width would be zero the height it doesn't matter 0 times anything is zero so whenever your bound goes from one number to another it's the same number that's going to be zero no matter what the function is that's zero this is the area under a point basically which is why that doesn't work okay second property this is kind of an interesting one I I get evil looks from people on this one the interval is backwards that's exactly right which means this in terms of integrals if your integral is written backwards like what I mean the bounds are backwards see how we start at B and go to a here that would be like starting at one and going to zero what that's basically saying is the if the interal is written backwards it's talking about the area that's under the x- axis uh this is this is this definition it says that in order to get this written properly so you can do the integral this is negative A to B well it's negative integral from A to B and yeah they they really should be a lot simp but that's the definition that do you feel okay with that so far now typically our integrals are given to us in in this fashion where we start smaller number we n bigger number so this we don't use it a whole lot but it is there for you get something that we can do you all right with that one okay okay third property just like before even with definite integrals you can always pull a constant outside of your integral so if we have C * FX where C is a constant this is the same thing as C * that integral also just like before this also works with definite rles if you have any sort of functions in terms of X being added or subtracted any functions whatsoever you can split those things up by addition and subtraction as long as you don't change your bounds of integration basically just says Hey integral from A to B of f ofx plus G ofx or F ofx minus G ofx split it up we've already done this several times with indefinite I'm just telling you now this also works with definite integrals which is what we're talking about here also don't forget your your DX that's got to go with both of those integrals okay but show hands how many of you feel okay with the properties we've talked about so far there's one more I got to give you I just want to make sure you're okay on this as we as we are here so area under a point P has got to be zero this says basic well my integral is written backwards it represents a function that's actually below the x-axis we're just writing it backwards uh so we can make it negative and reverse our our bounds of integration that's great we can still pull constants outside of our integral that's still appropriate we can still separate integrals by addition and subtraction not multiplication division unless we have that constant but it is subtraction absolutely just like derivatives did now the last one is interesting is just for definite integrals this doesn't work for indefinite and you're going to see why in a second but here's what we'll say now I'll give it to you with the picture first and then write it out let's suppose that we had some function really so easy and there's some number between A and B basically like some some number c would you agree that the total area of this figure from A to B is written like that if this is f ofx then this is the total area of that whole figure would you also agree that the area of this whole figure could be written as the area of this plus the area of this that's also true statement it says if you find some number c that's between your bounds of integration then this is the same thing as a to c and then from from where to where signic very good that's another way that you can split up an integral find the area of just piece by piece you can do that as well as long as this number is between a and b and they match right up to it so you start it you end at C and then you start right again at C also I don't know if I'll call this a property but I I'll list it anyway yeah you actually could do do in Reverse these are not one way I'm not going to write it twice you need to know that if this is the case you could write one integral out of that for sure absolutely that if you have integral from a to c and then C to B and it's the same exact function matched together that works just fine okay with that all right now last up this one it's kind of a common sense thought but but think about this if f ofx is greater than or equal to zero what's that mean in terms of a graph what's that mean positive that's above or below the x-axis so if the function is always above the xaxis the function's always above the x-axis for every x on a certain interval that right there says X is an element of ab it just says X is within that okay so if you're confused on the notation says for all X's that happen to be in my interval in English that's what it says for all X's that happen to be or or an element of the interval you okay with the notation on that if this is true for everything you mean you plug in any X and it's always positive it's always above the x-axis tell me something about the area under the curve on AB it's got to be positive that's what this says if f ofx is greater than equal to zero for all these X's then the integral from A to B of f ofx DX must also be positive or equal to zero does that make sense to you can you think through the the uh the logic on that the critical thinking on that one if your function is always up here and you can actually take an area of it then well the are is going to be positive because it's always above the xaxis you don't have that net sign area which this represents that's actually below you don't have anything that takes away from it it's always above you follow same thing as in Reverse I'll just state it out for you if f ofx is less than or equal to Z for all X and A B then the integral from A to B of FX DX is less than equal to Z so it's kind of same statement basically those are really all the six properties we have area could be zero if the numbers are exactly the same our bounds are the same it's are in point no problem we can flip bounds of integration by making our integral negative that's possible we can fill out constants we can separate by addition subtraction definitely not multiplication we can also break up an integral if it is to our benefit or put one together if it's to our benefit provided our functions are the same and there's a number between there that we can split up that's okay also this is just kind of a statement but it is truth if the function's always above the x-axis areas going be positive if the function is always below the x-axis the area is going to be negative that's the idea how many people feel okay with our properties is just fine cool let's try one more geometrically and then I will go on into how to actually calculate these definite integrals trust me it's it's not hard all right if you know how to do indefinite integrals you're almost set just one more thing so last little example here let's use some of these properties and what we know about the uh the area approach to these integrals and find the area of this thing there we go now that looks kind of nasty in fact you probably wouldn't even be able to take the integral of that if you didn't think about the area here because when you look at that you're thinking well substitution can I even do that with the definite integral first of all because we haven't talked about it does that even possible will be but secondly even if I did a substitution the substitution is doesn't really work out that well for us at least not exactly so that might not even work so we have to kind of think about the geometry in this particular part of it using some of these properties tell me something I could do definitely sep SE seate SE so from 0 to one of 4 DX minus tell me something else I could do on the second part of it after I write this way I'll write every step for you yeah absolutely I can pull that constant 2 out in front of my integral you okay with that so far now this point well we got some things we've talked about already today tell me can you find that that's pretty easy actually that's going to be I'll draw it in a second that's just going to be a horizontal line at four from 0 to one find that area this one what is that that's a half circle and I'm going from zero to one that's a we've done that problem already today so what this says is 4 0 to 1 what this one says is a quarter of a circle so basically what are intergral comes down to our area is what's this whole area minus 2 * don't forget the two this was pi over what was it pi 4 we got this area minus 2 * this area so 4 - 2 * 4 if we simplify just a little bit area is 4 - piun / 2 if you really want to find a common denominator and do that I think you'd get a 8 - piun over 2 if you really want it doesn't do you any good to do that but you could if you want to do you feel okay with breaking these things up and using some some geometry so in this section that's what you're going to do I haven't taught you how to directly attack a definite integral yet I'm going to do that right now this is kind of a roundabout approach we we say let's let's think about the geometry let's let's draw a picture of it let's use our geometrical approach to find area and that's what this represents would you like to see how to hammer at a definite interal just right on 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 4.5:  The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
yes yeah I was hoping so this is the good part you guys ready for the good stuff for good stuff you don't watch good stuff it's got cool words in it man other words like fundamental and Theorem and calculus we're gonna talk about the fundamental theorem of calculus oh that's right I really like to see every weekend consists uh it's like in front of the mirror doing all this stuff when I go to the gym to get my pump derivative no that's not true foreign you know that this is an area you also know how to calculate indefinite integrals you know how to calculate them like this but this was capital f of x plus C remember the plus C part all doing that we know how to do integrals we've done that already here's what this represents though what this says is okay an integral represents an area this is the antiderivative but what do we do with that plus C let's talk about that for right now and then we'll have a really good picture of what's going on so here's our I'll use the same graph I have over there here's our graph and this is f of x we're looking for the area what we want to do is find the area from A to B that's the goal without using our Riemann sums or the summation notation we don't want to do that we want to really just think of this as an integral because we know an integral geometrically represents the area so how can we go from this picture and this thing and tie it all together what we want is the area from A to B thank you here's how we're going to think of it we're going to think of it as well how about this could you find the distance from A to B how would you do it you would do B minus it if this was 10 and that was 3 you do 10 minus 3 right we're going to do basically the same thing we're gonna say let's take the area up to V minus the area up to eight would that make sense to you we'll take all of this area minus off all of this area no matter where you start that would work for you would you agree we'll take all the area from left to right all the area no matter where we start up to B and subtract off all the area up to a and that would leave us with this little bit how many people buy into that feel okay with it that's exactly what we're going to do so we'll take the area up to B starting from wherever you want it does not matter as long as you start the same point for both yeah a say what can you just make your starting point a would so you'd figure out the area of B and then subtract zero well we're I have to give you something that this makes sense right and the way to do that we we are going to start at a and go to B but find action you can see why we have this next piece in there right now if I if I give it to you you'll probably follow it but I want you to understand the concept of why we have a subtraction in this at all okay and we're going to have one right now so let's think of it if so the area is this is not changing there is this what we're going to do is take the area up to B minus the area up to eight now here's what you have to realize what we're doing here is calculating the area functions remember me introducing that to you a long time ago that this indefinite integral axis area function was a family of Curves we just know which one it was well if we have that family curve but we're going to actual point that says this is where you're going you're stopping here that solidifies it for you it's no longer indefinite it's definite you're starting at one point you're stopping another point so this right here that's an area function and we actually have something to plug into it we have the the point well where are we stopping the area of to be you find the area by playing B the area up to a you find the error by plugging in a so the area from A to B is the area up to B the area up to B that would include wherever your starting point where your starting point is for area that would include everything up to the point B everything above the x axis to the point B you got me and then we'd subtract off this point a now really what we'd consider is starting from zero that way we're not being silly not going way too far we say let's just go from zero okay you'd have this area minus this area it'd give you what's remaining the area up to B plug in B the area up to a plug in a that's how you do a definite interval you find the antiderivative and you plug in your balance it's actually that easy not bad not bad look come on now there's one one question out there what's the question come on do you see it what are you doing oh good do you see it where's the C by the way this right here this statement is a fundamental theorem of calculus part two I'll give you part one minute fundamental theorem of calculus at part two what happens to the C oh dear why do we have a c is well you do know definitely so we shouldn't have a seat but when you think about it remember when we're finding out this this right here this is a family of Curves right how do you actually smell where it's at when to curve way up here have a different area than one right here and this is clearly the height would be different so why does this even work well think about this for a second what about the sea how about C suppose you considered it by the way the way that you you write this um I should actually give it to you this way one more thing that's also written foreign X that's an evaluation symbol from A to B that's how you can write that and we're going to be practicing that as well it says the same thing okay this this and this is the same how you do this is you plug in B and you subtract off a you plugged in B to your nana derivative and you subtract it off F of a are you guys okay with the notation so when you see that that line right there it's like half a bracket goes from A to B that's what that means so this equals this and this equals to this let's suppose that we actually included the C now some of you might be wondering when you think about it you might be wondering why don't we have a C1 and a C2 say it again they're the same concept why are they the same constant how do we know that for sure he's right why say it louder so from the same function if you're integrating that same function you're not switching functions on me are you and you're written the same thing then whatever C you get is your C no matter what you're plugging in that's going to be the same function itself does that make sense so wherever you're at that's the same function so we integrated one time look what's going to happen if you have F of B plus C it's not C1 it's just c f of a plus c is not C2 it's just C what's going to happen to my C's wherever you see is wherever you see is that height the height difference will be eliminated it drops out of your equation as your book likes to call it the C's are gone so remember the plus C that's just the height right height of your function even if it's way up here same type of function just way up there but both of them would be way up there the F of B plus c F A plus C we're subtracting out that plus C part the plus C's will be eliminated from your equation thank you and that's how we get what we get so the sea is gone drops out so we don't write it for our definite integrals indefinite absolutely but definite we should end with a number end with an area because this thing is an area if I show hands some people feel okay we're talking about so far today would you like to try a couple examples you're going to really like these by the way are you ready to really like something yes in this class after that this weekend you're sunk now welcome to the privilege okay so an integral from one to five of X DX this is an area which means we should end with a number it's actually a definite integral why is it a definite integral in it and not an indefinite integral of constraints right there there are bounds or bounds of integration we actually have numbers we should end with an area now can you integrate x DX easily yeah we already did no no need for limits no need for any of that stuff that you've spent your whole life doing just now okay it's doable you did it right but this is a shortcut not sure okay I guess there's a shortcut to doing it what is the integral of x please where are we integrating from where do we start our area where do we stop our area one to five why don't we have a plus c here even if it fell out even if we even if we did it's gone because you can subtract it off anyway it's the same plus c one to five here's how you show your work you do this step first you show me what your integral is you show me where you are plugging the numbers from you plug in the top one first subtract then plug in the bottom this would be 5 squared over two minus 1 squared over two is how you show that see where the five and the one are coming from so we're going to get 25 halves minus one half how much is that 12. yeah 24 halves is 12. is that quicker than a Ramon sum all the stuff you've been doing left end points yeah what is 12 what's 12. exactly right area under that curve which is just a diagonal line from one to five thanks you're welcome the other stuff is good to know it shows you where it's coming from it shows you why you're doing it shows you how you do it and you you make sure you know what what all this stuff means right if I just gave you that you could do it but you'd have no way you would not understand it uh we did the limits of the sums so you would understand why you do this how you do this now we needed something else though because when we get to things like this foreign doesn't work all that nice for that Gabby will do an integral with that so this is also an area it's an area from zero to pi over two of cosine X that's your cosine curve now the integral of cosine X you've got to be able to get these right otherwise your areas are going to be wrong you'd show an area above the x-axis when it's below or below when it's actually above what is the integral of cosine X please do you need to memorize that yes yep and where are we going which one do we plug in first the pi over 2 or the zero all right which one the pi over two otherwise you'd have negative which would find it by the way if you notice that when your bounds are reversed notice how you're subtracting off the wrong thing let me switch your sign of your area right that's why the whole the property I gave you where you can switch your balances which is the sine of your integral that's why that comes about so here you'd have sine pi over 2 minus sine of zero all right come on now people I know you love some trig functions throw it at me one which one's one minus zero equals one your area is one that's weird oh my gosh have you thought of this what this is if you do you understand what this is yeah what's the picture it starts here goes like that here there right hope so hard cosine goes to oh I have to race it to draw a better picture did you have questions on that nope that's the video on what yeah you just found yeah don't draw these first round your card first shoot come on now so teach you a master's degree yeah yeah that's your area that you just found that's equal to one isn't that very interesting that's interesting it really is interesting in excess probably negative one and then it'd be very positive so on and so forth positive one negative one negative one positive okay and then do positive one so I'll add it all up zero yes okay is that just so it's the area of a circle zero did you catch that would it be if you did an integral yeah yeah because you had area above and the area below would match up because we're talking about net signed area right now we haven't made it to total area which is what we'll do in just a little while uh we haven't made it there yet total area would change the area below the x-axis into something above the x-axis so you could actually add it together we'll talk about that in just a bit but right now we'll do a couple more examples just to really illustrate this stuff and then we'll go until next class now they're always adding up to zero is that still true for also tangent no tangent has undefined points you can't go forever if you think about tangent yeah also one that would probably be kind of hard with uh Ramon sum and those are those limits okay not one that's great however can we do integrals with it sure sure you tell me what you do first thanks to the one half you know that'd be a good idea standard immigration sure don't jump to something super hard right away don't jump to a substitution I haven't showed you that for this yet right so that's off the table right now don't jump to that stuff see if you can do it easily all right make sure you use maybe change a root or two substitutions often work when you have electric functions as a good indication for that you should probably try or if you have parentheses that's a really good indication you should probably try and it won't distribute nicely that's a very good indication you should probably try so x to the one half yeah I'll bind to that DX I like that and combine that X2 that how much should we combine those you add right your X is five halves extra five times yes yeah can you take an integral of x to the five halves very easily this would be x to the seven halves over over seven halves over the same exact variable I'm sorry exponent uh exponent up top X1 on the bottom no problem make it a little bit prettier here we're gonna have two x to the seven halves over seven and then we get to evaluate from four to nine if we plug in a nine first I've actually given you some nice numbers do you know how to view seven halves uh on without a calculator or to make it quicker on the calculator this is power over root right oh geez I hope so do you remember that power overview so you can take either one whatever you want first I would take a square root of nine square root of nine is three three to the seventh that's what you plug it in your calculator I don't I can't do that in my head that's a pretty big number three to the seventh is huge so this is two times someone tell me what nine to the seven halves is or three to the seventh how much minus this is the square root of 4 is 2 then you do 2 to the seventh times two to the seventh blue are you okay on getting those numbers out ladies and gentlemen 2 times 280 2187 is what this should be 256. someone give me since we already have a common denominator someone give me 4374 minus 256 please does that simplify at all that's that's not there's a y7 then you'll leave it for the decimal if you really wanted to let's make sure before we end this that our math is correct okay get a double check on two one eight seven yeah you got that as well can I get to double check on the 128. same thing here as well all right how many people give what we talked about so far awesome we'll try a couple more examples we're almost done with our definite integrals all right well what do you say we continue some examples here up here we got the integral from 0 to pi over three of secant squared x DX now we don't have any substitution for definite integrals yet I'm going to show you something about that in a little bit so right now everything basically has to fit our integration table what we learned last time was that when we do an integral like this a definite integral we found out firstly how to do it and secondly that's exactly like find the area with a Vermont sum or the sum of those partitions which is very nice very very nice so let's go ahead let's take the integral of secant squared x DX do you all remember the integral of secant squared x DX tangent tangent squared just tangent good so here's how you write that he'd say okay I know this is 10x plus C or not yeah if it has bounds no because you're going to find an actual area because what you're going to do right now is you're going to be subtracting F of B minus F of a and if those did include C it'd be the same C that would drop out of your equation anyway so no we don't have a plus c on this what you do do is you have this first and then you throw up you know throw up sorry that's it when you get home for your homework you put up the the integration oh sorry the evaluation symbol you go okay I'm evaluating from zero to pi over 3. so therefore you show me what the integral is you show me your bounds of integration your bounds of evaluation and then you plug them in which one do you plug in first zero or the pi over three okay so what this says is tangent of pi over three minus tangent of zero plus not too painful how much is Tan pi over three don't leave me hanging awesome 1.73 like my calculator says yeah okay very good learning unit circle Route 3 over 2 divided by one half reciprocate multiply you get root three that's because it's sine of a cosine ah you need to know that okay anyway uh so we have our our integral that area underneath the curve of secant squared between 0 and pi over three is ah we got it square root of three it's interesting right it's kind of weird that we're able to find those areas so nice and neatly oh you need to try a couple more of these things yes no yes did that make sense to you besides the square root of three which you all just kind of screwed up right now all right hey you're the one screwed up okay explain to me something about this problem okay very good explain why what's wrong with this problem it should go from smaller to larger bounds in fact in fact if you did you would get complete you get the right answer actually if you try it right now you'll get the right answer but that proves the statement that we went before that this is going to be negative so for instance if you did this you get x to the fourth over four right no plus c but if you evaluate it from four to zero like it says you'd have zero to the fourth over four minus four to the fourth over four and what that would end up being is negative four to the fourth over four so four cubed negative 64. so I've done my math correct did I do my math correct yeah now let's check to see if we get the right answer the other way as well we also knew from a property that if I reverse this and go zero to four that becomes a negative well let's see that would be negative x to the fourth over four that would be negative you need brackets there because you can have a sign in the middle of that and that's evaluated from zero to four 4 to the fourth over four minus zero to the fourth over four that would give you negative 64. here 64. which by example kind of proves that that was true that I can reverse my bounds and that makes makes me change my sign so just by example we see that that is true but notice how you do actually get the same exact answer either way that's because it is true it has to be what it represents though it's kind of awkward because this looks like it's an area above the x-axis when in fact it's not this is just read wrongly incorrectly so the correct way to do this problem would be to write the balance in the appropriate order with the negative out in front of it and that would give you negative 64. either way but this is this is kind of showing you okay this is an area underneath the x-axis not above it how many will feel okay with with that one foreign okay we could bring that square to the top foreign okay all right you'd have negative one over one minus negative one over negative one Disco hopefully if I did that right make sure my signs are correct I'm looking at this negative one over one minus negative 1 over negative one that's negative 1 minus one negative two you get an answer you do but now think about the answer well you can have a negative it would mean it's underneath the x-axis oh that'd be okay think about the function then graph it on your graphing calculator if you can't think of the function it's a domain no because it's negative think about the function what's the function do I don't want to draw it in crayon for you think about what the function actually does we have done so much in this class for you not to know this say what where does it have an asymptote okay it does have those that's okay though because I'm between negative one and one I'm between that draw the graph if you if you draw it you should know the shape of that graph you really should okay you're gonna make me do it you're going to make me oh my gosh plug in zero why not so what's it tell you at x equals zero what do you have look at your bounds where they start okay so are you adding up areas that actually are undefined at zero so it says you're making rectangles one of those rectangles is going to Infinity do you see it it's probably infinite infinitely many of them are going to Infinity because when you go that close you're gonna anyway so can you add actually add the area even though you can do the work that doesn't exist there's a there's a theorem in calculus I don't think I get to it but basically it says that if you're not bounded somewhere if you're not bounded you can't add up those areas so if it goes on forever in One Direction right you can't you can't do it so you have to have that here we have an asymptote going to Infinity we're not bounded in any way shape or form therefore that area cannot exist or it does exist but you can't find it using the methods that we use there could be something else I'm not sure if they they have a way to do that to be honest with you right now but I I for what we know that doesn't work it's not negative two if you think about 1 over x squared that's positive anyway didn't it yep and if I did my signs wrong it would come out to zero I don't think I did my did I do my side wrong no hope not I did it real quick but if you did it would just come up to zero anyway which you know there's an area it goes like this it's it's it's a positive area so that it's not it makes nonsense and it's because there's a domain issue you you had it right it's not the negative it's a fact that we start here we end there and there's a problem between them that would be the problem do you get it there's a problem at zero zero is between negative one and one you have to be at least bounded between there typically you have to be continuous and bounded and that would make it work yeah even if even if our bones were a little bit wider it still wouldn't be on the fine sense that you can't measure measure at x equals zero what I mean by bounded isn't this way I mean this way um you have to have this here's a curve between these two points it's got to have a low point and a high point which means you can't come up with something here and come something there that's between really it's just if you're just talking about the x-axis is only above you just have to be bounded above it doesn't go anywhere if it was below the x-axis it'd be bounded below so this one's really irrelevant when you're talking about the x-axis that one doesn't matter but you find an area here it's got at least speed boundaries above when you do something like this hopefully you see the problem you see the problem how are you supposed to add that area that goes to Infinity I don't know what the area is I don't know if you can if it's if you can say infinite area I would assume so because it's going to Infinity but you can't calculate it like this like this how many people understood that where the problem is what's the problem again explain to me again what's the problem diminishing why why domain issue someone else domain issue why at zero and why is zero important it's actually in our interval if I had done this would there be a problem no not at all but if I cross over that undefined point where you have a domain issue and go into Infinity that's an issue for us we can't do that now is it kind of clear for you all right you guys had it come on you should know around the bed you should know that this picture looks like this too like that just by thinking about asymptotes you should know that it's until going to days like this asymptote in the middle goes like this says they're both positive pulling into positive is positive pulling a negative is positive goes like that you should know that anyway this none of that works so we just put undefined for well this one you would do oh yeah the new one would do but the original problem would be tried undefined or you would explain to me that there's a domain issue and that since our bounds are going from negative one I cross over somewhere we have a vertical asymptote therefore you know we can find the the area of that curve between those two points okay now let me show you one more thing that we can do are you ready for it were there any more questions on that line that's a good one huh even though because it looks like you can do it and you do it you go I win negative two but you don't think about what the function actually is it burns you up you don't want to do that by the way I don't assume that all of them are going to be like that on the test so if all of you go oh yeah it's got a domain issue I can't do it you're probably mistaken I'm not going to give you 20 integrals that you can't do okay you might get one of those 20 right yeah maybe one maybe maybe one I always find that funny I tell you one thing and you always assume it's that thing oops oh you know what I can show you one more thing on this uh so that you would you would actually see it as well if you you should know going back up here you should know that because of our property that we had okay that should be true right and now when you think of that you go oh there's a problem there see the problem there not zero the ending bounds there you couldn't even try to do the interval there you couldn't even plug it in you'd have undefined and undefined and I would show it to you right there okay so it's trick sum when I put it like this but when you see it like that you go oh yeah it's more clear now how about this one oh my gosh piecewise function can you do it with a piecewise function of course you can it's actually not even that hard what you have to do though is realize what this question is asking you this question says I want the integral from 0 to 6. of f of x where f of x is defined as X cubed when X is bigger than or less than two five x minus 1 when X is bigger than or equal to 2. so can you break up this integral in a very similar way I did up here so that you can make maybe two different integrals well let's do that where's our first integral going to start let's let's do this zero very good and and where does it go yeah because that's our separating point over there too um what function is defined between 0 and 2 the top one or the bottom one good the X cubed very good plus because we know using the property actually to find up here again for you we can separate an integral into two different integrals by matching up the bounds zero two and then two two of which other might have a question well does it matter that this one's actually less than two and this one's greater than or equal to two no not really we're we have such small rectangles doesn't really matter uh they're they're all going to match together anyway so no no if you have say that it wasn't greater than or equal to two then it would say which is greater than it would matter correct because you could have a gap like that no still do it although wait wait did you say that this one changed no the one that didn't have it then you'd have an undefined point yeah you I'll say it this way the area of one point doesn't even exist anyway so you could technically do it with two different integrals because the area of that one point doesn't matter uh it's one point area the width of one point is you can't do it there is no width between one point it's it's a a point is that which has no breath which means it does not have a width no matter what the type is the area would be zero of that single point however this wouldn't make sense from zero to six this one couldn't be given to you like that because this says continuously from zero to six and so that really wouldn't make sense does that make sense I couldn't do that to you because you wouldn't have the ability to break it up because to break it up it does have to be continuous um that in another without I think I gave that to you I don't know if I stated it word for word the way the book does but in order for that property to work the ability to split up that integral has got to be continuous that's another reason why this one would fail that's not continuous do you get that you could even split up to begin with it's got to be there it's got to all be there you kind of have the ability to break it up that's the only way this works otherwise you are missing points like you pointed out that's a good point a great question I talked through that pretty quickly are there any questions about what I just said were you able to follow it yes the bottom function is minus two or something either in the jump that you won't be able to do it either or if they didn't actually match um oh that's a good question you mean if there's a actual Gap like if we plug in 2 and it doesn't look they're not the same for both functions yeah they're not in this case no it doesn't matter just it means that you're defined for every point from in this case from zero to six that you have something for every one of those points okay that's the ability to break that up now in practicality does that if you add those areas or you add what was it here if you had those areas it's going to be the same you just can't do this if you don't have that that's the the point does that matter you just can't do it legally Legally speaking you can't do it theoretically we've made no difference so theoretically does make a difference that you cannot actually do it practically this area plus this area will equal this area yes sorry right now this area plus this area this area plus this error I should do it this way this area plus this area even like that will equal that area because the area under the point is zero but you can't do this unless you have this good questions you're making me work for my money today that's why they pay me the big bucks you know that right explain all this junk to you um the Audi I drive is o1 so huh okay the integrals aren't actually that hard let's plug the numbers and getting that right huh that's the biggest problem in math is small stuff my gosh don't forget any signs don't lose anything keep track of all your numbers get that stuff right new map s did y'all get your integrals correct you got access for them before from zero two you got five x squared over two minus Exogen forgiven to the minus one right from two to six did you get that far yeah now we plug the numbers in um probably I don't know if I should count on you guys on that one right okay you know your grouping needs some brackets and parentheses on this thing because you got stuff going all over the place especially when you have those those multiple turns being added or subtracted this one's pretty easy this one you just plug into two and you plug it into zero and that's very straightforward you get two to four over four minus zero over four this next one you got some things going on notice how you have to plug in the six that's giving you the five times six squared over two minus six then you plug in the two but you're subtracting remember it's F of B minus F of a the whole thing do you see why the parenthesis are important here okay if you wanted to distribute you distribute that sign with chain you know typically order operations say you add all that up together before you subtract anyway but it's important that you know that so we're plugging in the two we got all that down uh you want to help me with the math that should be what four four plus so that's four thirty six 90. 84. okay so that's 84. eight minus eight right looking like 80 to me did you get 80. cool how many people were able to find the 80. do you feel okay with it if you weren't able to actually do it on your own you were able to pick okay with it now what's it represent what did we just find the area of what yeah of this when it's defined this way between 0 and 60 if you found the area under that curve or actually the area uh the the net signed area if this thing went below the x-axis I'd can't see that it does but if it did go below the x-axis then we would actually have the area that's that takes the difference between the area above and the area below that would be that signed area do you feel okay with this example do you have any other other questions whenever we have multiple terms in one we just take the first one put in for all the X's solve and then take that absolutely what this says to do is you plug in the six the whole way through you figure it out that's the area from zero to six above this function then you subtract from 0 to 2 and that's what that's going to give you okay and so no matter how many terms we would have plug them all plug them all in and then subtract and then plug them all in and that's what you do you got to plug them into everything yeah and for this instance your X becomes six every vcx for this instance it X becomes two wherever you see X and then you subtract and that's what this meant F of B minus F of a that's what that meant you take your B you plug it in take your a you plug it in and then you subtract it okay now while we've been talking about this entire time is something called net signed area I gave you that signed error before what net sign area was was this you took the area one you took the area three because it was above the x-axis and you subtracted area two because it was below that is what your definite integral will do automatically without asking you it will do that why does it do that well because area below counts as negative area for a definite integral that's actually one of the things that we saw with our switch and signs that's another reason why that comes out negative is because when you go from whatever this point to whatever this point is if it's below it's going to be subtracting those those areas in thereby cause them to be negative so this counts it gets your your total area now in order to count total area what you do is this you say I want to count up the area that's between the two curves I don't care which one's on top or which one's on bottom I want to find out the actual area between them so find the area that's here and here and here that would be total area this is net signed area so one push and a half for you is how in the world could we get this area to become positive how would you do that absolutely see you later absolute value absolute value will absolutely take any negative thing and make it positive what whenever you see it right so what we're going to try to do is this we're going to try to take this one and flip flip it over and say all right well total area then should become area one area three not that we don't want that that's going to count as negative area what we want to do is find a way to flip it over here and make it count for us that would be total area for a total area we need to change the sign of area two in other words if you kind of go on further than this you say well I want to change the sign of any area that's below the x-axis if I can do that then that negative area actually counts as positive area we added up together and what we end up doing is we end up finding the area between two curves one of the curves is the function the other curve is simply the x-axis now in section 5.1 we go further and we actually do legit two curves not just the x-axis but keep in mind that this is exactly what we are doing is finding the area between two curves so I'm going to draw on this later you understand so this is one curve this is the other curve it's a very simple curve it's just x equals zero but what we're doing is finding the area that's bounded between two curves that's what we're doing literally in order to do that that's positive that's positive that's negative we have changes sign of that for the x-axis that's it so for total area we need to change the sign of area two or in other words the area of any piece of the region that is negative foreign excuse me that's the area that's below the x-axis no I'll show you how to do it right now okay now check it out here is net signed area net signed area said you start at a you go to B you just take the integral of whatever function you have and whatever happens happens positive area means most of it's above the x axis negative area means most of it's below the x-axis even if we cross over it just basically says your net change what what is mostly happening whether you're more positive the negative or more negative and positive no matter what it actually is on the on your graph does that make sense to you now total area says no no no we're going to take all the negatives and we're going to make them positives whatever the positives with us we're gonna leave them alone the thing that leaves positives alone and changes negative suppositives is of course absolute value like you said so total area says all right we'll still go from A to B but now we have the absolute value of f of x just remember one thing the absolute value of f of x so the absolute value of any function is actually piecewise it's going to look kind of like this is why we did this first it says you keep f of x if f of x is positive you make it negative f of x if f of x is negative that's why you do absolute value it says shoot man if your function is positive why are you going to change it that's going to be a positive area in fact we know it's going to be positive area for one of the properties I taught you before whenever your function is completely above the x-axis hopefully we need to listen to this whatever function is complete above the x-axis your area would be positive remember that whenever your function is completely below the x-axis you're going to be negative if we make an area a negative area negative that's changing the sign of your negative area it will become positive so here's what this says this area will be positive this area this area will be negative so we're going to change the sign thereby making it positive are you clear on this did I blow your mind grenade did I really hope so would you like to see an example in practice Yeah it's not hard thank you it's gonna look a lot like this as a matter of fact there's just one more step to be able to figure out where you separate it you see we just did this piece of ice function only in this piecewise function I gave you the separating Mark right I said you go from zero two and two to six all you're going to have to do is figure out where that Mark is for yourself what that's called is a sign analysis test bam I told you this is exciting exciting stuff here folks signing out how can you not get excited with Sun analysis test find the area between f of x equals 1 minus x squared and the x axis on zero two well what we mean is total area let me let me insert that right here find total area total area between that side area would be very easy net side area you would just take the integral look at here would be net sign area it would be from where would your integral start ladies and gentlemen where where would it end so your function is 1 minus x squared DX this right here is net signed area do you understand it would take the area above the x-axis subtract the area below that x axis because it would be negative and that will be your net gain your net change in area okay that's what that would be this says Ah new total area the total area will do this it will take the negative area and we'll flip it above the x-axis or at least it'll change the sign of it and that would count as positive area it would say I want to find the area between them take all of it and add it all together no matter what the sign is added together because the absolute value will change it to a positive you're following that okay so how do we actually do it well here's your steps step one you've got to set your function equal to zero do you know why you got such a function equal to zero not wires hey if you're trying to figure out where the function is above and below the x-axis you better find out where it crosses of the x-axis that makes sense to me does that make sense to you because you know where across the x-axis then you can perform a sign analysis test plug in some numbers easily and say oh it's above it's below therefore I know when the area is going to be positive I want to be negative you get me so set the function equal to zero and solve so for us I'll do that in purple so you see the work over here we're just going to get 1 minus x squared equals zero well there's only like two more steps what are you going to do with this probably add x squared yeah and then you're gonna yeah sure square root plus or minus x equals negative 1 and 1. raise your hand feel okay with this so far okay now the next step you got to set this up correctly what you're going to do is you're going to do a sign analysis test analysis but you only need a few of these points what points do you need well let's see do you need the zero yeah do you need the two of course do you need the one yes do you need the negative one no no no no you don't need that one why not it's not just doesn't care so really you're going to make a side analysis with your endpoints of your interval your bounds of integration and whatever points fall between them that's it so make it with your your endpoints and your x-intercept that fall within those endpoints foreign points then you know what you wouldn't even need that because it's either all going to be positive or all going to be next you just test one and go with it yeah so signals with endpoints and any x-intercepts that happen to be within your bounds of integration well let's go ahead and do that now so we're going to make a sign analysis test here's how sign analysis testability case you forgot what you do is you take your balance of integration first the balance of integration start at zero and then end at two you take any of those x-intercepts that you have those are the places where you're crossing the x-axis and therefore that's the places where your signs could possibly change well only one of them that's one feel okay with your seven analysis so far after that after you make that that number line you just determine when f of x is above zero and f of x is below zero that's just clicking into Point plug in one point for each of these intervals that's only two you want to feel over here I don't care I don't care about that one either I care about these two intervals plug in one point see whether it's above or below the x axis recall that if it's above the x axis the area has to be positive if it's below the x axis the area will be negative and this is a separating point between those two areas that's why we set it equal to zero so we're going to determine what f of x is greater than zero that would be above the x-axis or less than zero below the x axis have you done it already you plug in probably one half where are we plugging this in by the way to our original function yeah plug in the function it's going to tell you I don't care about the number I care about the sign of the number which one's one half okay so this is positive and this one's negative cool what this says is that from zero to one I'm above the x axis from one to two I'm below the x axis we're going to have to come up with that that sign change we're going to do it right now what we do is we're going to split up the integral using the definition for absolute value foreign foreign okay here we go this is a good part let's find tool area so where are we going to start and where are we going to stop for our first interval where are we going to start zero to where cool yeah yeah absolutely now think back to this what the absolute value of x says it's sorry absolute value of f of x says is if it's positive you leave it alone if it's negative it changes the sign so when this is positive here's what we're going to do between 0 and 1. do I change the sign or not what do you think I'm going to leave alone I'm just going to do 1 minus x squared why don't we have the absolute value still foreign I'm actually using this to change it I'm saying well if f of x is positive for that region then I know the absolute value of f of x is simply f of x I know that this is positive for this region therefore the absolute value of f of x is simply f of x that's the that is what this says it says hey if it's positive you don't change anything about it you basically just drop your absolute value signs are you with me on that okay DX plus again the reason why we do this just like the piecewise example do you recall that between 0 and 2 if I find some intermediate point I can split up my integral from 0 to 1 and then also from one to two remember that it's continuous no problems no breaks that's great between zero and two we're going to go zero to one we're going to go one to two now between one to two this is why we did our sign analysis test our function is negative which says it's below the x-axis it says that the absolute value of x well if f of x is negative you're gonna have to change that sign if you follow you can't just drop the absolute value because it's not positive you go all right well back up here I'm going to have 1 minus x squared sure but negative it makes you feel better I can do this too you can do lots of things as you want so hands I'm gonna be okay with that so far okay I'm not gonna do much of a recap I'm just going to say what we're doing here is basically using a sign analysis to our advantage to determine when our function is positive and negative where it is positive for that region you leave it alone you you just write it no absolute value where it's negative you just write it but you have the negative in front of it this is the reason why though is because we have this scenario because we know that the function's above the x-axis the area will be positive if the area is if the function is below the x-axis it will be negative and that one nice property to set if you have a continuous function between two points you can split up that integral into two different integrals by using some number that's between them that's all these properties coming together there's a lot of properties we're actually using here to be able to do this it's kind of cool now what I would do with this integral I wouldn't distribute this I pull the negative out I would do I just pull the negative out just make it a minus that means the area is 0 to 1 of 1 minus x squared DX minus one to two one minus x squared DX I'm doing this just so you can see this this part of it check it out but you know this area is positive right right you know this area is going to be negative right minus a negative area that's adding the area that's all this really does for you why don't you go ahead and do those see what you get foreign foreign foreign foreign did you get two I got two I don't know if I did a ride there pretty quick did you get two if you didn't get to his old fraction work but hopefully you got two where how many people were able to make it down to this part right there that part the integral did you get that far good did you plug in all the numbers at least this far yeah from here on out it's just fraction work uh calculators are fine I don't care as long as you're able to get the right answer down here be able to do that uh can someone please double check my work to make sure that I am correct on that yeah make sure all my signs are right you did how many double checks do we have they got two good for you good for me actually I did shoot come on all right well we're ready to tackle the fundamental theorem of calculus part one the first part we did was actually part two that was all the area things and being able to calculate a definite integral which means an area by doing that whole subtraction find an anti-derivative plug in B find the anti-derivative plug in a and subtract the two that's the fundamental theorem of calculus part two the part one basically says this it says the derivatives and integrals are inverses says one undoes the other that that's basically the idea the most common like small sense I can make it so let's suppose we have this this function y equals f of x is some function and it's continuous over a certain interval starts at a a point and ends wherever we want ends at some X down the way you get me on that some some X even even changeables provides continuous up to that point then the area is a of X we already know that area is going to be some area function such that when I take the first derivative of my area what does it have to give me in this case say it again very good so if f of x is continuous over this then the area is a of X some area function and the derivative of the area function must give me back my function of my original function that was the antiderivative thing saying that this is the anti-derivative this is the antiderivative of that treating this like a derivative going backwards well I could write that a different way I could write that also as the area then should be the integral of f of x we also had that from the the for more missing right says that if I want to find the area it should be the integral of f of x DX from a to X you okay with that as well it says that the first derivative of the area is going to give me my function back therefore the antiderivative of my function between my two bounds whatever they happen to be should give me my actual area it should give me the area now this is in terms of not a b but an X so as to give me the a of X not the actual area does that make sense it'll be a function of the area that's what it's saying there how you'll feel okay with that so far now I'm going to do one thing so that we don't get a little bit confused because it's kind of awkward to have a function terms of X and then have a bound of X what we use here is called a dummy variable it really doesn't matter it's just a variable that we're going to be integrating because you're going to be plugging in X later anyway so the X's will appear so typically what people do at this point they go you know what let's not call it f of x let's call it f of t DT they make it a dummy variable now why the dummy variable doesn't matter is because when you think about it when you take the integral of this you're going to have a function in terms of T correct but look at your bounds of integration you're going to go from a to X you'll be plugging in the X's somewhere for your t's you'll reinsert them into your equation that would give you an area of function in terms of X like we're looking for how many go feel okay with this so far okay well here's the basic idea I'm gonna try to tie all this together for you real nice and I'm going to try or try to try I really will try to make it neat would you agree that this equals this yes for sure you you believe that yeah oh then we're almost done that's fantastic very good because this means a derivative right that means a derivative so the first derivative equals f of x the first derivative equals f of x however we we also have this statement right here what I'm going to do is make is make a little substitution right there so what this says is the derivative of a of x here's another interpretation of a of x what's F equal what did the sequel are you seeing that this is the same thing as this yes or no this is a of X so is that from right here I just went this way I made a of X that way that has to equal f of x as well this right here is the fundamental theorem of calculus part one okay yeah because we talked about this first and does it and so and so where you have the F of T because of the way you do the integral you're just swapping it out and inserting your X to make it come out with f of x not F of T right we use the uh we use the T here so you don't get confused in X of X because it's hard to think about oh I'm going to plug in X in for an X that's weird why do we do that but so what we do is we use a t and say I'm plugging in both X and A for my time or you could like use x subscript One X subscript 2 to keep them separated or it doesn't matter what we use besides t no you could use the H there if you really want T is a dummy variable it doesn't really matter you're gonna need you're going to be integrating some variables right for those variables you'll be plugging in X's that's the idea did you follow a of x equals this derivative of a of x equals this therefore derivative of this equals f of x that's a table of theorem of calculus part one here's what it says in plain English okay it says if you take a what's this stand for of uh what's it stand for it will give you back your function that's it if you take a derivative of an integral basically it undoes everything it essentially says they're inverses it says a derivative undoescent integral a integral of your function gives you something right an area function as it will then you take a derivative of that it gives you a break gives you original function back now why why why is this important because that seems pretty Common Sense doesn't it well you've already kind of thought that well I mean shoot if an integral is undoing a derivative it should be the inverse of a derivative this this proves it the derivative is inverse of an integral but how why we do it is because sometimes it makes um make certain integrals very easy to do here's why maybe not in certain integrals but certain computation is very easy to do foreign any work any work you can tell me what this is actually x to the fourth without doing any work why well because you have a derivative of an integral the integral starts I don't care but it ends at X wherever it is that means that this is going to be whatever our dummy variable is but with an X instead so this becomes by this by this theorem if you want to see it proved out which we can do that directly I'll show it to you right now um that will be a derivative of if you did the integral you're going to get t to the fifth over five from one to X true what that would give you is a derivative of x to the fifth over five minus one to the fifth over five do you see where the x is coming in you said why we have a dummy variable it doesn't really matter if you're plugging in export anyway okay do you see why this number doesn't matter when you plug in a number to that you're going to get all constants what happens when you take a derivative of constants zero so really only that matters so you're going to get a derivative x to the fifth over five minus one-fifth what's the derivative of x to the fifth over five minus one-fifth ladies and gentlemen foreign which proves it well at least for this example I basically kind of proved it here with this statement here it's done there's some more serious proof to it if you really want but that's basic enough for us now that you could do directly some of them you can't so when you get to this this integral like this I don't want you to spend too much time on it because there's no way you can do this integral in this particular class let's say you had something from 1 to X INE of T over T DT you can't do that integral directly you can't do it the same way I did it all right it's not you can't just Hammer at it not an integration table you can't do it however because you have a derivative of an integral from 1 to X from a any a to X you can use the same property right here so how much is this going to be equal to sine X over X is right that's exactly correct now one thing does have to be defined for the entire just like remember how we found out last time it's got to be defined you can't it's going to be continuous it's got to be very nice you can't have the undefined points it has to be bound somewhere I'll be okay here one to X remember this is a small number so it can't go backwards are we okay what's the one number that's not okay we miss a zero so we're okay if this had gone from like negative one to X we probably have a problem because we couldn't evaluate that in the goal foreign so when you get to some of your homework some of it's going to be kind of easy uh if it looks like this a derivative of an integral and you're going from a to X and it's defined for that whole region that means it starts higher than any problems that you have that's all you got to do plug in your x's and you're done a derivative will undo an integral that's the fundamental theorem of calculus part two part one what I say two part one that's it everyone understood that good for you that's fantastic which all intervals were like that I know right well the thing is we don't always take derivatives of integrals right next to each other it's not doesn't happen very often but it's a it's a statement that says it is true it's proving that they are inverses now we're going to move on this is typically a different section in most other books but this book ties it all together with this we're going to continue doing definite integrals only we're going to do some more I guess tricky ones they're not super tricky but they're going to incorporate something you've already learned in this class which I guess is kind of nice but we haven't dealt with it yet we're going to start talking about how to do definite integrals that might involve a substitution you ready to learn how to do that it's not hard you've already learned a substitution right yes so if you've already learned substitution I just have to tell you what to do with the bounce the bounds of integration after that everything falls into place so same idea let's look at how we deal with balance that will be our the rest of our lesson okay Okay so oh what are we on we're still on uh 4.45 4.5 it's still a good station with that so we'll talk about definite integrals thank you but this time we might have some substitution it's still in your best interest on your homework to check if you can do the integral without substitution if it's just a simple distribution or simple a simple changing of some exponents from square roots into one house I think we had one this last time right and you combine them that's probably easier than substitution because substitute might even work in that case but if you have to use a substitution at least you know how to do it already there's there's basically two methods I'll show you method one first and I'll show you method two method one says this foreign it says you're not going to change your balance you're going to do the same exact thing as before but you're going to be sure to substitute back in for you before you evaluate so method number one is don't change balance Sub in for you at the end foreign don't change the balance substitute back in for you before you evaluate and you'll see exactly what I mean on this example foreign there you go okay let's look at the integral that's the first time we've had like a honest to goodness integral with some numbers up there and something that was wasn't just super super basic so this looks like a real integral with some real numbers and some honest work to do first thing could you distribute everything out you could you really could in this example you probably wouldn't want to though because that's a power three it's going to take it take you a long time so substitution in this case would probably be your best bet ignore the bounce when you're picking your substitution it's just a basic integral just like you did with indefinite integrals pick the correct substitution why don't you do that now at this point I'm hoping that most of the substitutions are pretty obvious the only times they might be maybe wouldn't be is uh with some of the square roots sometimes people forget about that or trig functions sometimes they're not obvious you have to guess and check so you what's you yeah good what's d u H yeah don't forget that yes you need the DX and then hell I've taught you how to do this is I've had you solve for DX that makes a substitution nice and neat so in solve for DX you're going to get d u over 2X equals DX you came to so far everybody okay now what do we do so we're going to have what are we going to have a why don't you tell me exactly okay I've heard 4X what'd you say after that yeah perfect and then what excellent zero can we talk about that in a second person how many people feel okay with our substitution Forex is still there for right now the U cubed comes from U cubed DX no no not DX anymore d u over two x and then we start simplifying things and then Michael said something interesting from zero to two um yes and and kind of no yes and no we're going to put it there but I want to show you why method two uh can do something different for you because as soon as you do this from zero to two as soon as you do that from zero to two look what's going to happen sure you're going to eliminate this two and that's going to become a 2. yeah and you eliminate this X and this X and what you would get is zero to two with a 2 out in front of it you see where the two out in front of it's coming from that two pull up front U cubed d u variable what's your variable Union if it's you not you you it's you what were these bounds originally in so we kind of have bounds that don't match our integral right now which is sometimes leads to problems because what people do often is they'll do this they'll go okay hey I know how to take an integral it's very easy I'm going to have 2 U to the fourth over four and then they do this explain me why that might be incorrect yeah right these are in terms of X right but the integral makes it seem like you're plugging them in for U now you can do it this way you can you really can provide that you do one thing provided that you don't change the balance we didn't change the bounds and substitute back in for you before evaluating so not here this would be the wrong way to go do you see why it's the wrong way to go honestly do you see it yeah you're trying to plug in X is for use that's not going to happen so instead we're going to do a little bit of Supplication still we're going to get the fourth over 2 and you all said that you're going to substitute back in for U in terms of X before you plug this in you see if these are in terms of X I want my function to be in terms of X my integral to be in terms of X when I got to be in terms of X before I evaluate so we'll substitute back in for the U we'll get our x to the second minus 1 all to the fourth power then over two and at this point this is where I should evaluate so right here a little bit of craft up there now we need to go from zero to that's okay that says now that we have this in terms of X is great they match up with our X bounds that we started with now plug in the two plug in zero once you do that and see what you get don't neglect that zero zero squared minus one isn't zero so you're going to get something over there I got that did you get that cool what's it mean it's an area what type of an area is a total area an assigned area good we haven't talked about absolute value or anything um not sure if that one's going to have any negative area if you graft on a graphing calculator you could tell or if you wanted to find out total area what you would have to do is find out whether that's above or below the x-axis for all of those points I'm not sure in either case maybe you can look at that but you'd have the absolute value for total area you remember doing that from last time yeah that's a value you take this you said equal to zero you'd have your pain points and any points in between there that would change the sign of that thing and you separate those two intervals and that's how you do that problem so this actually is net signed area whether or not we have it all above or or below and this if it was all above the x-axis netsigned area would be told area but if there's any area below the x-axis it would have automatically subtracted in there for us so that's the case otherwise anyone graph that do you know if there is any area below the x-axis between zero and two I guess we could find out real quick between zero and two yeah yeah there is between zero and one it looks like this is negative yeah okay that's what it looks like I mean there's a little portion like that just a little bit on the side of the row it looks like well ah C you can see yeah we have a little bit below the x-axis between zero and two so that's going to be counted against our area right here so this is actually total not not total area this is net sign area it's discounting the part between 0 and 1 and then we have from one to two that would actually be positive but it's greater than the negative area that's why we have a positive 40 out of that and we will do okay with that so far would it be substantially harder to do that it's actually harder to break them up not really it's actually just a matter of separating our integral going from zero to one and having a negative in front of that and then going from one to two and doing it just like we just did you just plug in some different numbers so it's not that much harder just have to do an integral twice so I don't want to do that right here because we have to change bounds a lot in the next next example but that would be something to talk about are you okay with uh with this first example do you understand the idea of not changing balance basically the same exact thing you do for every example you just don't change the bounds you do the integral like you normally would change it back into action like you normally would and then plug the numbers in that's the first method second method says well maybe there's maybe not necessarily A quicker way it's not quicker maybe we can just do it a different way and either way notice that you're going to be plugging these numbers in you will be plugging in zero and you will be plugging in two usually do it a different time so we're going to talk about method two I'll show you how that works yeah I'll tell you which method to use on the test when I want you to use it if I don't tell you a method you do whatever method you want okay you must usually learn both methods okay method two method two is you change balance you change bounds during your first substitution thank you if that's the case here's I'll give you like a little foreshadow of what's going to happen you're going to change your balance from X's into terms of U using your substitution if you change your bounds into terms of U do you need to substitute back in at this point for x no no because they'll be in terms of U so if you do method two you change your balance and then you do not substitute back in before evaluation it's the same tell you what let's do the same example can we do the same example just do a different way foreign so you can see I'm not full of smoke here it really does work out I'm not here to re-teach you how to do substitution I've already got you everything you need to know that's that's not doesn't change so that's nice you'll still use the same substitutions no matter what what I'm here to tell you is there's a slightly different way to do it so if we pick the same substitution U is still x squared minus 1 and a d u is still 2x DX and sure enough d u over 2X still going to equal DX that doesn't change at all still okay with that here's the change the change says well since we're substituting everything anyway I mean we're substituting this for you this X part for U and this X part for you why not just do the balance as well why don't we substitute those things for you as well and here's how to do it you're all right well that's a good idea Mr Leonard let's try here's the point when you look at that that says X is going to become 2 that says X is going to become 0. why don't you find out what U would be when X becomes 2 and U becomes 0 and that's the that's the question notice how we're actually doing that right here we're plugging into two we're plugging in zero zero it's just within the evaluation process here you just do it beforehand so that when you get your balance it's in terms of U so you don't have to do this step you just go directly from here it's basically do you want to do the work beforehand or do you want to do the work after does it matter you're going to do the work either way so it's really up to you now I'm going to make you learn bold I'm going to tell you what to do but it's an option for you you got it so we'll say if x equals 2 at x equals zero this is the whole process of changing balance if x equals 2 then U equals 2 squared minus one then U equals 2 squared minus one see where the two is coming from right and U is going to equal what okay if x equals zero U equals zero squared minus one very good well now we can make a substitution with everything and the bounds will match to the uh the variable which is nice so let's do it do we still have a 4X of course do we still have x squared minus 1 of course not that was our U notice how it's going to look exactly the same as the previous problem d u over 2x the only thing that's going to be different is what what is the what does zero become what did the Two Become it's going to be done the same way two is gone X is gone so negative 1 to 3 will still pull the 2 outside you did the third du hey we even do the interval the same way we're going to get two U to the fourth over four and we'll simplify that U to the fourth number two but now when I do my evaluation do I have to substitute back in for the U no because we did our balance and that's the only reason why we had to here because the bounds were in terms of X here you've already changed them you've taken x's and you made U's out of them once you make use out of them you can use it right here get it you can use it here negative one to three because those are in terms of you plug them in you're going to get the same answer so let's try that hopefully you get the same answer it makes it so your evaluation is just a little bit simpler by the way because you typically typically because you have uh this function is gone right now that you don't have to plug that in and they don't do all the math basically you just do it ahead of time you're still doing it though you're still doing it it's just kind of set aside for you up here which is I suppose nice minus negative one to the fourth over two well what that's going to be is 81 over 2 minus one half and again that's 40. show of hands how many people feel okay about the both methods how many people prefer method one method one okay that's cool you can it's fine how many people prefer method two people seem to to like that a little bit better for some reason uh simply because you're doing the work ahead of time you don't have to worry about this later on the two mistakes I see are are this uh I see because people integration is not that bad I see people making mistakes here they either forget to substitute Back in X here or they accidentally do it here again and they get something way off you see what I'm saying that's where the mistakes happen so do one or the other now of course on a test I will ask you for both maybe not even that long so you do this if you want but I'll give you some where you have to change balance I say I want to see you changing balance so you do need to learn that method either way so those intermediates since like where it says two kind of integral of your Q been zero and two that's not actually true right this is slightly off right so yeah how would you actually write that if you're still right yeah you're so right uh but that's this is one of the reasons why we have that because you go oh these fountains don't really match up with that letter now you could say well maybe we'll just treat like a dummy variable it's really not because of substitution but we know in our head that we're just going to plug back in for X so it still works but you those really don't match up all that well actually at all they're x's and that's a u good question any other questions before we go on he actually work it has to do the same thing it is the same thing you're just doing one part here and you're doing one part here one part before evaluation before even integral another part after the integral during evaluation that's really it you're doing the same work same one just two different places good questions any other questions before we go on well why don't worry why does it work yeah well it's taken a function to make it something else uh basically translating into a different variable yeah and then you have to change your X variable into your U variable to make it work okay so right now this is zero two but it's regarding the X function this is negative one to three but it's regarding the U function that you just created does that mean that the integral level translating into yourself within that family okay that way it comes out to be in the same area well that's a good question um you're completely changing the function when you do this right you really are and so you're just making it it's almost magical it works kind of cool but it's you're making a different function and saying the areas will be the same because I'm working with different balance in that function if you try to do it graphically man I have a hard time believing that too too you cubed is going to look anything like uh 4X x squared minus 1 to the Third in fact I know that because a cubic is just goes like this right 4X x squared minus 1 to the third does well we saw it I showed you the graph it doesn't look the same so you're changing functions but you're only talking about the areas so basically you're saying the area here between these bounds is the same as the area here between these balances I suppose perhaps but it's a direct rate that means it's equal a new portion would be a better way to make analogy there um but something similar to that idea it's kind of it's very cool now you need to know the substitution doesn't always work right so you can't always it's only very special cases I can give you lots of intervals where you can't use a substitution in fact most you can't use a substitution that's special well everyone that you can do substitution with the derivative has to be in there somewhere right it's got to work that way in your next semester which I'll be teaching in uh no spring of oh one three a year from now a year from now so just go ahead and fail this class or something take it next semester pass it with some other teacher and then come and see me just 4B for now you need to skip up to 4C no okay then my videos won't be in order I see that wouldn't work they're going to be in order all right what do you say we practice a couple more would you like that yes hmm you're not sticky enough some of you always complain I give you stuff that's too easy in class and doesn't look like your homework well here deal with that then huh actually it kind of does look like your homework most of the top I would say some of them are harder would you not say I think except for the most part anyway that's fairly difficult looks like something that would throw some people for a loop let's talk about it uh firstly can is it a fit your integration table directly just like that oh not at all so it's going to probably involve a substitution if we can do it it will involve a substitution I want you to think through don't say it out loud just think about what a proper substitution would be in this case think don't say hello some of you might be asking well could it be 2X could it be 2x if it was 2x it'd be sine of U to the fifth times cosine of U side view the fifth times cosine U does not fall in the integration table so that doesn't really help you at all let me change it let me see if I know what you're saying you're saying that if I change it to this change it like that okay that's good why is she changing to that what do you think it really is easier to see isn't it uh your U should not be 2X not 2x that's not going to work for you I know I said it's supposed to be the inside thing this is an inside thing however if you take the 2x the derivative of 2x is only two that's just a constant it's not going to eliminate the cosine it's not going to eliminate the sine you're still going to have sine and cosine that would be a bad choice but you'd see that bad choice within like a minute right at least I would hope so because you go through the process of your way to say yeah something's not right here micheliner I changed this thing and you change it then you look back at your integral and say well do I pick sine of 2x or cosine of 2x because that's the only other thing I'm going to do I'm definitely not going to pick to the fifth power fifth power you'd have it you know you'd have some sort of a chain chain rule or general power if you want that's going to make things a little messy because you're going to have sine then cosine because it's not going to simplify out for you very nicely you typically pick the inside of something without the power so we're going to pick sine of 2x foreign remember how to take derivatives of sine of 2x because a lot of people here forget one thing about this do you see that sine of 2x is actually a no it's not a negative image it's a change or whatever D U equals here's how you do chain rule how do you do a chain rule uh do you people don't take your side flip the cosine 2X multiplied by DD of X of 2x okay cosine 2X absolutely but then the derivative of the inside must also be there you see when people do this a lot of times they're offline factor of two actually a factor of one half because when you divide this one-half but they're off by that they're off by a factor of two because they forget all about the two do you see the two don't lose two okay so we're gonna have d u equals cosine 2X times 2 DX otherwise I'd probably write it as 2 cosine 2X DX that's the appropriate way to write that just don't lose the two it's a chain rule you got to have the derivative of 2x somewhere the derivative of 2x is the 2 move it out in front of your cosine so what we're going to get is d u once we solve for DX it's going to be kind of obvious that we picked the right choice and here's where you'd make that judgment by the way you're getting more practice on uh substitution right now too right it's kind of nice do you see anything that's going to cross out that's where you make your your judgment you go okay if this becomes a you I'm good to go if this gets crossed out that's fantastic and I'll be left with no more x's and that's exactly what we want you feel okay with this so far now at this point we're also going to change our bounds we're going to change our balance because I don't know about you but I'd rather deal with the bound changes now and then just have to plug in some numbers rather than change everything back to sine of 2x and then have to plug in numbers and then figure out sine of that again you follow me I don't have to do that so when we have x equals pi over 8 and x equals zero let's figure out what those things are some of you guys are zoning out don't zone out stick with me here you use your U substitution you plug your X in and you figure out what U's value is so here we'll have sine of 2 times x well X in this case is pi over 8. how much is sine of pi over 4. 2 divided by 2 very good absolutely right you guys okay with the root two over two awesome let's do the zero I'll take care of the zero for you sine of two times zero I love this one that's sine of zero sine of zero is one right good just checking I was really checking it yeah and zero same zero is zero so do you know your new balance let's do the substitution let's do it correctly let's substitute everything we can we'll substitute for DX we'll substitute for the sine of 2x we'll also substitute for bounds so here's how the integral looks when we've done all our substitution we go from where to where now where do we start zero to where that's because we're going to change all this stuff in terms of U that's why we did our changing balance okay is the sine of 2x to the fifth power still there can you please tell me what I have instead people on the left U to the fifth not just you but you to the fifth that became a you yes you to the thing do I still have the cosine of 2x there as of right now yes do I still have a DX there yeah no that's our substitution right here we're going to do d u over two cosine 2X but I show your hands how many people feel okay with this so far so far good that's awesome almost everybody okay tell me some nice things that happened what are we going to do right there you know for sure your substitution working you have nothing but use you've already done your balance change that's great and do what else great the two's on the denominator becomes a one-half I like it zero to root two over two dependable do you now that is a nice easy integral the numbers you have to plug in aren't all great but that's okay just plug them in so take our integral we're going to give don't forget about that one half one half U to the sixth over six I'm going to make this nice and neat before I evaluate I'm going to get U to the 6th over twelve foreign do I have to plug in the X back into this thing before I evaluate why not because you avoid taking care of it I'm going to change my balance that's exactly right okay so root 2 over 2 we're going to plug that in first then we'll subtract and plug in zero so root 2 over 2 to the sixth power over 12 minus zero to the sixth power over 12. foreign now root 2 to the sixth power is 2 to the third eight so you got 864 stairs well yeah root two to the sixth a it is eight right yeah that's going to be one eight yeah one eight yes am I way off or am I okay 1 8 over 12 over one reciprocating multiplied okay okay what I'm asking you are you okay up to here are you okay up to here after that use your calculator I'm gonna do it I did it because it's uh square root of 2 squared to the third so square root of 2 squared is 2 then 2 to the third is eight that's how I did it and then two to the six I had to have up with that that's that's the 64 and then you start simplifying that but that's the way you probably do this without a calculator how many people understood what we just talked about feel okay with both methods you can do it without changing balance right that's pretty basic just make sure you sub in before you evaluate now changing balance a little bit more advanced of a concept but it makes things easier sometimes nice nice doing this off to the side you have to really worry about it then you just use your U just make sure you don't the worst thing you can do is substitute back in for X here and then evaluate with your terms of U that does twice the work with no reward all right let's continue a couple examples like I said we got maybe two more to do I'll show you how even and odd functions can play a role in calculating some integrals sometimes very nicely and then we'll get on to how to find the area between two curves and you're going to find out that it's it's just a small extension about what we've been doing so far you guys ready for today let's do this so looking at our first example we got the integral of course we're talking about a definite integral so think in an area from two to five of 2x minus 5 and x minus 3 to the ninth power now does that fit your integration table in order to make it fit you'd have to distribute the x minus 3 to the ninth and then foil well foil oil first Outside Inside all that not just foil anyway several several times until you got this huge polynomial then take the integral of each piece which would be fine to do it would take a long time but it is possible and then you plug in the numbers to every single variable that get a little tedious right so if that's the case when it looks like that you're probably going to try a substitution probably going to try substitution now one is not readily apparent because what I've told you about substitutions is normally usually the derivative has to be up there somewhere right it's got to be if not you need to manipulate the substitution somehow so let's go ahead let's pick a substitution the one that you probably want to pick right now anyway and then let's see if it works for us okay so pick a substitution right now go for it on your own using what I've told you pick a substitution is it 2x minus 5 or x minus 3 that you picked good including the ninth power or not no it's usually just the thing inside the power that we we take okay well that's all well and good U equals x minus three what do we do after that this is pretty easy in this case d u equals DX hey that's nice that's a direct substitution from d u to DX however when you look at the problem we go from two to five we're going to change this in a second by the way I just want to make sure the substitution is going to work before I start changing bounds and doing things like that I don't want to waste any time I still have a 2X minus 5 and here I'm going to have a u to the ninth and my DX will be a d u u to the ninth got it DX is D U Got It what's the problem there's still a mass that's the problem you have a d u but you will have a u and an X and these are still in terms of what right those are in terms of X so if we can make the substitution work I'm going to go back and change the balance but I want to make sure it works first before I waste that time you got me when this happens to you and it will when it happens that you make a substitution and you know you made the right one yeah if you made this one that certainly wouldn't work in the way shape form but if you know you made the right one you know wait a second that's not falling out of my integral anywhere sometimes sometimes not all the time but sometimes it means that you have to manipulate the substitution to solve for x and substitute in for x and that's sometimes what it means so when we have especially when there's no power or anything you can do that oftentimes and we'll be able to distribute later so it says okay U equals x minus 3 can you solve that thing for x how would you do it then what you say is all right then X is U plus three correct now we can make the substitution instead of X hey what else could I write let's do that then it changes everything into ease so our integral I'll do the balance in just a second our integral is 2 what else parentheses I like it minus five and all that well yeah big old bracket because you're still multiplying by U to the ninth well let's see if we can all follow that do you see where the U plus 3 is coming from ladies and gentlemen so we're using the substitution we just made to solve it for the other variable solve it for X that way we can substitute that in and it changes everything into use and that's great so we change that into a u we have two that's U plus three and then minus five the whole thing still being multiplied by either the ninth so I still have to have that bracket now at the same time since we're now all in terms of U now that's where we probably will at least change our bounds that that'd be a good thing to do so once you go through right now and change your balance for me I'll do on the board as you're doing it but make sure you can do it don't just follow what I'm giving you foreign did you get 2 and negative one all right so let's change our bounds down here instead of going from two to five we know that if we plug in 5 we're going to get two we know if we plug in 2 we're going to get negative one so that changes from two to five that makes it negative one the two now a quick question just to refresh your memory when I get down to the very end am I going to have to substitute back in for x or not because now in terms of you and that makes it nice so at the end we're just done we just plug numbers in that's why we change the balance in the first place okay hey what next come on this We're Gonna Roll I don't want any rate right there yeah distribute out here too and minus your five and then multiply by you tonight yes we call that tedious algebra work ah two U plus six minus five then U to the ninth d u two U plus six and then minus 5. okay well that means we'll have two U plus one tell me something about this integral what I absolutely have to do in order for this to work got it I cannot just integrate the way it is we found out that we can't separate integrals by multiplication the only way to accomplish this is to distribute and then we do the integral piece by piece so when we distribute please note that we're going to have same bounds of course we'll have 2 U to the what and very good do you hey that's a whole lot easier that's a whole lot easier to integrate than that one but that looks almost impossible if you really if you didn't have this to follow you go wait a second a substitution won't work try one anyway see if it will work see if you can manipulate like I did and then maybe it will if that's the case it shoot it makes it a whole lot better to work with and your balancer even change so that's even nicer so now we're going to integrate let's go ahead and integrate and then we'll we'll evaluate so our integral is 2u to the 11th over 11. plus u to the 10th over 10. are you guys okay with the integral some of those integrals are pretty nice right just take the basic stuff and substitutions that's that's what the substitution is supposed to It's supposed to make your integral easier not worse easier as it definitely does make it easier now what do we do good because we changed the bounce first we know that our bounds are in terms of U not in X anymore these were in X's those are in use so as soon as we get down to the very end it's now evaluation time just make sure you evaluate very carefully we're going to get two times two to the 11th over 11. 2 to the 10 over 10. that happens from when we plug in the tube we get it plugged into both those those terms it has to go to both of them so this this piece right here is just the two evaluated are you all right with that so far yes or no ladies and gentlemen yeah okay then what do we do subtract all right you gotta do that and we'll plug in the negative one two negative one to the 11th over 11. Plus negative one to the tenth over ten oh my how much is 2 to the 12th because that's what that is that's two to the 12th 2048. okay I'll leave you foreign times two that's going to give you that or just two twelve gives you that plus 2 to the tenth one thousand okay all right minus well two times one negative 1 to 11. negative 1 to 11. just negative one get the odd exponent up there is going to be negative so this is negative 2 11. that though that's a negative to the tenth power that's going to be positive one so this would be plus 110. I'm going slowly so you see where all these numbers are coming from can you follow the fraction work I know fractions are that's your favorite thing but it's Friday right what happens on Friday directions obviously so fresh and Friday Okay so we've got 40 96 over 11. Plus 10 24 over 10. plus 2 11 minus 110. so far so we're good on sign changes all right we'll combine some like fractions we got 11th and elevenths that's going to give you four thousand 98 11. that's going to give you 1023 tenths and then you're going to find a common denominator all right which is probably yeah 110. I don't want to do that it's 52 233 110. wait 52 233 over 10 over over that's the simplified fraction times yeah that's it awesome I mean that's easily relatable right now of course what is this that we just found don't get confused with all the mumbo jumbo what are we doing that's an area could you find a decimal equivalent for that yeah if you had to actually give an approximation for area you could do it that's the area under this curve between those numbers that's what that's doing how many people feel okay with that your calculator will do a lot of the fractions for you so don't let that hold you back if you can get it down to here your Calculus is done evaluation that's actually doing all that stuff now the numbers and Prouds per hour that big but you can do it you ready for one more yeah any questions on this one before we begin your face says question well your mouth doesn't I got to that point where I messed up my evaluation I'm trying to figure out what fraction I screwed up got it I'm gonna say that's on you yeah okay okay foreign okay granted this one doesn't look fun it really doesn't look fun uh it looks fun to me I love this stuff but maybe not look fun to you why does it look fun yeah tree always throws you guys for a loop oh tree seriously oh I hate tree too bad second he goes man it's not just an X in there which is actually fortunate because you wouldn't be able to do the problem if it was uh but it's a pi over X and then it's over x squared so there's a lot going on it certainly doesn't fit the integration table one question I have for you that's going to kill me if you get this wrong it really my head's going to explode on the camera screen and then no more videos so don't do this to the people at home watching me literally stuff but let's see can you combine this or this and get oh good okay it's not cosine of pi over X cubed right right yeah it is gone no it's not it's not that then you get cosine of pi the the very easy integral that's not the case though this is an angle over a function of X that's what that is so we have to somehow use a substitution that's the only thing we have in our Arsenal right now we have direct fit or substitution later on you'll get a lot more okay that's your next class but right now that's two things we can choose from if it's not a direct fit that we can't combine things like we cannot do here then it has to be a substitution for us to even do it if a substitution doesn't work then we are Sol sorry out of luck uh you can't do the problem anyway uh let's go ahead and let's look for a substitution then true or false the substitution should include the cosine true or false why because then you take a derivative of the cosine right and that would give you negative sign does negative sine appear up there that is probably not the right choice true or false the uh the substitution should be pi over X 5x true y naught x squared because it's not but it's not inside anything it's not exciting thing that's a good place that's a good reason also when you took the derivative of uh x squared it'd be 2x right you know and that's why I asked this question that this is an angle no matter what you get you cannot cross that X Out you follow me you can't touch it angles we can't do we can't touch that with anything so even had you taken that as a you it's still and simplified you cannot go inside of that cosign like that unless you have one of the like double ankle half angle Pythagorean theorem identities to break up things you cannot do it and so the only option we even have is pyrox so take a substitution of U equals pi over X go for that right now take your derivative if you can you know how to take derivatives so we've passed that portion so take your derivative thank you also I want you to change your balance right now notice to take a derivative you'd have to do that you got to bring that X up to the top to take that derivative did you do that unless you want to use a quotient rule which you don't trust me pi is a constant you don't want to use a quotient rule but this is not a prodigal either because Pi is a constant it's like the number four it's like number two you don't have that here so if we take a derivative of U we take a derivative with respect to X on this side you're going to get what yeah I'm going to do in two steps you see the negative pi x to the negative 2 DX are you guys okay with that how many people made down that far what you have you did good at least you forget how to take derivatives right so we need to know how to take a derivative and what are you supposed to solve for DX yes solve for DX maybe make it look a little bit prettier before you do that because right now it's like confusing what am I doing sort of divide by X and negative 2 you can and then flip it up but what this really says is d u equals negative pi over x squared DX do you understand that that's the same thing I the negative pi stays there the X to the negative 2 goes to the denominator of a fraction now you can solve for DX if you saw fight it for DX probably multiplying by the reciprocal would be the appropriate way to go on both sides or you can do two steps dividing by pi multiplying by x squared in either case hopefully you can follow this one you're going to get negative negative x squared over pi d u equals DX I need to see if you can make it down there on your own because that's some basic algebra but you've got to be able to do it imagine if you can yes guys on the left hand side yeah okay so basically multiply by the reciprocal on both sides and this is exactly what you're going to get also I told you to change bounds where do you change bounds do you do it here where do you change balance way up top all the way at the beginning so let's go ahead we'll change our bounds we'll do it right here in this corner when x equals three we want to find out what U is when x equals one I want to find out what U is when x equals 3 U is supposed to equal pi over that X so that would be pi over 3. that one was almost in the way so I didn't want to confuse you pi over three did you get pi over three as well when x equals one you're supposed to be pi over X so U would equal I how many people feel okay with this so far make sure you have these in the correct order make sure you map them correctly from X to U correctly if you don't you're going to get the wrong sign on your integral so Watch What Happens here when I do my substitution what was X well it's three well it's the U that correlates with three pi over three when X is one what's the U that correlates with x equals one right now you'll notice something do you see what's technically wrong with this picture it is backwards that's right it's backwards it's going from PI to pi over three that's pi to pi over three which says if you want to you can interchange them but it's going to make your integral negative I can guarantee this integral is going to end well I can guarantee you this integral is going to end with a negative area that's what it's going to do so and that's because of that that relationship right there so the reason why I said be careful is because if you go oh yeah integrals always go from pi over 3 to Pi then you're going to miss that negative you had to write that right like that first because the three maps to pi over three the one maps to Pi that's what those bounds were you can't write them backwards just because you want to okay that didn't work we got to really be careful on that and if you're going to switch them around then you're going to have that negative out front okay now for the the other good stuff uh we have uh what else is up here come on now cosine's still there yeah if it's not part of your view it's still there cosine of what are you you x squared is still there for right now the DX is definitely not there instead of DX you're going to write what DX equals to that's negative x squared over pi do you foreign I do like that for you now some interesting interesting things are going to happen interesting things are going to happen some things you're going to cross out some signs are going to be pulled out some constants are going to be pulled out let's see everything that happens here tell me one thing that happens experts are great if that didn't happen you need to have to manipulate that somehow like we did before which would be kind of be a pita a pain in the rear end okay you don't want to do that or that's about it you can do it so cross out your x squared that's great what else can I move out in front of my integral now you have negative 1 over Pi yes sometimes you already have a negative I'm not doing that yet okay let's see if we can all make it down there in our heads are you feel good with that so far so just doing our substitution we simplified some algebraic things up here moved out our constants which is great now this is in the wrong order but right here that's going to look like it helps us a little bit if I reverse them notice I can change the sign right put them in the correct order I'm going to change the sign so what this says is let's go ahead and let's let's flip these bounds when I flip the balance I'm giving it negative negative 1 over pi my integral will change from pi over 3 at pi to pi over 3 back to pi over 3 to Pi cosine Udu okay make that negative way too big there we go but you see the negative negative right technically what I really should have is a big bracket around here if you want to draw that you can but that negative negative is going to change that's going to become a positive so we get our 1 over pi from pi over 3 to Pi of cosine u d u by the way it's really nice that we change bounds here because otherwise we'd have to substitute back in for that and it's a little bit more confusing you have to figure out a couple things as you're going it's nice that that's already done for us what I'd like you to do right now would you go ahead and do the integral go ahead and evaluate it the way that we've written it the way that it's kind of nice for us and then see what you have don't forget about that one over Pi out in front remember it's positive now because of negative negative gave us that positive oh yeah by the way the integral of cosine sine or negative sign sine okay that would change your problem right remember that the derivative of sine is positive cosine so the integral of positive cosine is positive sine no plugging in back for X's we already change our bounds that's great so we don't have to do this whole resubstitution thing we don't have to do that we've changed our bounds off the side we were already in terms of U that just means from right here let's evaluate it so we'll do one over Pi that's going to be out front inside we'll have sine pi minus sine pi over 3. same time zero zero okay heavy stuff for a second I don't know why what oh yeah I had it in my head is something different sine of pi over three how much is that good are you able to get that as well cool zero minus root three over two negative one over pi negative root three over two put it all together you're going to get Negative root three over two point that's your area looking at your area would you say that this curve is above or below the x-axis for most of this region for most of this region if it crosses I don't know whether it does or not but if it crosses most of it is below the x-axis because our area is mostly below the x-axis so area speaking it's mostly the advanced axis how people feel okay with our example okay that's the one the last one you get about Direct substitution with a different angles and changing balance I'm going to show you some kind of tricks some night nut tricks properties of things you can use to make a even and odd functions work for you sometimes are you sure there's no more questions on this stuff do you feel pretty comfortable with it substitution no problem now it's just changing balance and being able to evaluate I've given you some kind of nice examples that kind of illustrate that a little bit better for you but let's talk about even in odd functions and how we can use them to our benefits sometimes foreign even and odd functions and integrals let's talk about even functions for a second hey tell me something what do you know about an even function oh so say that again symmetric yes about about what thanks x-axis no well yes the other one okay yeah it's symmetric about the y-axis dear goodness me yeah that's what even means uh x squared is an even function export even function x squared minus two even function they're symmetric about the y-axis that's one thing we know about even functions here's the definition of it actually even function says foreign I hope it makes sense on why that would work it says you plug in the number or the negative version of that number and your height is the same what that's going to do is make it symmetric about the y-axis notice that plug in 2 you get out seven whatever like a negative two you get out seven that makes it symmetric it's going to go up at the same rate on either side of the of the y-axis and that's what this is doing so it's this and what it means is symmetric about the y-axis thank you just make sure you know it's the why well let's think about this for a second then let's suppose that if f is even foreign and I'm going from negative a to positive a go from negative a to positive a taking the integral of f of x DX if f of x is let's go through the logic K Bar if f of x is even what do you know about f of x symmetric so that means that when I plug in negative a and I plug in a I get the same output at any point between the plug in the negative and the opposite of that I'm going to get the same output right would you agree then that the area from negative a to zero would be the same as 0 to a yeah if it's symmetric about the Y it better it better be because you're going to get a picture like this I don't know what f of x is going to look like but I know it's going to be something like this whatever this does this is going to do the same thing on the other side it's supposed to look the same by the way not that good of an artist my paper looks better I should show you my paper thank you still laughing at two They're laughing at my picture hopefully you can't hear that in the video They're laughing at me well if it's even you're gonna get that relationship if you're going from negative a to a that's actually a special case right it can't be going from like negative B to positive a because those numbers wouldn't match up that would be different but it's going from negative to positive the same number well then you know this area has to equal this area which means that this integral is going to equal that integral does that make sense sometimes it's easier to calculate from zero to a number than it's from negative to another please or do that so if we can do that no problem if it's even function shoot we can do this we can calculate two times that integral we're good to go zero is normally very much easier yeah now if you have to use a substitution the zero might change but normally zero is easier let me just show you with an example that this does actually work the only thing you have to do which kind of stinks is that you have to prove it's even before you can do it you can't just say ah I think it's even let's try it no it doesn't really work all the time so you got to show that it's even so for instance let's talk about that one now that's a pretty basic integral um you could clearly do this integral just the way it is you could just do it and that would be just fine I'm not going to give you a super tough one where where it's super super nice to do that I'm just going to show you with one that's easy for us to see that is possible uh first thing you do though you got to prove it's even here's how you prove it's even you start out with f of negative X and you have to show that that's equal to f of x so f of negative X says this you go to your function f of x and you just replace x with negative X so for us that would be negative x squared plus four do you see how I just replaced the X with the negative X and then you work it down you see what you get what's negative x squared squared plus 4. what's x squared plus 4 it's f of x that's exactly what I have back here right there that proves it's even if you start here and you end here that means you have an even function okay what that says is that instead of doing this integral the way it is I know that this is going to equal 2 times integral 0 3 not that x squared plus 4. I'm going to let you do that the rest of the way out what you would do here take your integral evaluate it from zero to four no no no you wouldn't zero to three you can go from zero to three and then multiply that by two has anyone done that already once you work on it let's see if we can get a couple of the same answers up here are there any questions on the even part of the board before I erase it did you understand the concept even means submector about the why you prove it's even that means the area on the left and the area on the right will be exactly the same therefore you go from zero to to a whatever that number is and multiply by two just be very careful these numbers absolutely must match up for this to work for even functions if that was a negative four and that was a three all bets are off you can't do that anymore thank you 42 I have no idea while plugging in the zero is a whole lot better and plug in that that negative three huh that's nice that really is nice make sure you have parentheses there for you to do it 9 plus 12 times 2 21 times 2. 42. 42. do that 42. this I think it is 3 cubed over 3 is 3 squared 3 Squares nine nine plus twelve is twenty one twenty one times two is 42 so cool deal did you get 42 as well awesome so it makes it a little bit easier since we're plugging in zero now odd functions what do you know about odd functions they are symmetrical very good across the y no that would be even function not the not the X across the orange if they were cross decks it wouldn't be a function no that's an inverse darn it the darn thing I don't know I guess everything else I know yeah origin yeah exactly right it's symmetric about the origin which means that it's a basic rotation of 180 degrees about the origin so it says well it says this actually it says when you plug in negative you get Negative of the function and it says this when you plug in like negative three it's going to give you some value if you were to plug in 3 it's going to get Negative of that value so it's going to take it from up here and move it down here that's a rotation of 180 degrees or a what they call symmetric about the origin so that is the definition of odd and what it means that it is symmetric but it's symmetric about the origin thank you not in the axis let me give you the picture before I even even do this here's what an odd function would normally look like X cubed is an odd function x to the fifth is an odd function that's an odd function thank you very much you know what maybe they do a little bit different here for you it's easier to see this way uh that would also be in let's let's pretend that's an odd function a little bit easier to see here let's say I'm going from negative a to a tell me something about this area and that area if it's an odd function and symmetrical about the origin tell me something about those areas wait explain something about the areas first this and this they are the same area would you agree on that since it's metric they have to be the same it's a rotation of 180 degrees that is the same now tell me something about net signed area y zero what netsite area says take the area above and the area below variables positive the area below is negative and see how much change you have and here would be zero there'd be zero net area out of this thing does that make sense that would be for net area if it asks for total area total area it'd be exactly the same as an even function yeah it'd be this times two just like an even function was for a total area now a definite integral does not automatically calculate total area a definite integral automatically calculate net signed area unless you have what in there that's the value that's exactly right so what this says if your function is odd an integral is going to calculate the net assigned area therefore if you have an odd function if f is on and I'm going from negative a to a notice of those numbers they have to be the same do you see why they have to be the same if I go just a little bit closer right here are the areas the same anymore clearly not so they have to be the same but what do you know if you're going to take a an integral of an odd function which is symmetric about the origin and you're going to go from negative a to a which says where you end is exactly the same but opposite it means your area is going to be exact same how much is that integral Oh shoot that's nice do you even have to do the integral no no that's beautiful thing not unless I ask you for total area if I say total area then this is what it does this is above and beyond what what the book does right now but if I ask you for total area then it would be this right and what that would be is because they're equal areas you'd have two times zero to a just like you've had an even function it basically think about what it would do just think for a second what absolute value does absolute value pretends that anything below the x-axis is above the x-axis right so absolute value hope this makes sense absolutely we go ah what's that do changes from odd to even see it kind of cool right and then you have exact the same thing for an even function that would be for a total area if it's just like this though given to you just like that that implies net signed area that means areas are the same but not the size of the x-axis that means the area is equal to zero hence the integral would be equal to zero would you like to see one application of this sure you're gonna like this you're going to ask for 30 of these on tests well maybe one maybe five are we going to get it you can always hope one question in this one expectations excuse for one question test right one person never mind we lie we don't want that on there no you don't the thing about using these properties is that you have to prove that you can you can't just say I think I can go because all of those would be zero for you guys you'd be like oh negative three or three zero I'm awesome no you're not awesome well me you might be awesome but not at that you gotta prove that it actually works just like you had to prove it was even you have to prove this was odd now this says I can do a lot of integrals that otherwise I couldn't do do you see why it says that says my my gosh I mean did you know how to do that I don't right now just looking at him thinking trig substitution but you don't know trig substitution you know substitution substitution you know use substitution so that's off the table no matter what you do with the substitution that is not going to work take the take 1 plus x squared derivative is 2x that doesn't appear takes sine X there's no cosine you're stuck the only thing you can do is say well it's going from negative three to three let's see if this is even or let's see if this is odd if it's even we're probably stuck anyway because they still can't do the integral even doesn't get you away from the integral just says I can multiply by 2 and have a zero in it that's nice odd gets you away from the integral that's even better so let's try to see if this thing is odd what you do is you start out with your function that's what we're trying to get to but maybe you have a negative part and you say what I want to have is I want to plug in Negative X and let's see what it does for us so take everywhere you see X and see what happens so negative x negative X if I do that this actually isn't that it looks bad it's really not that bad square root of one minus or sorry 1 plus negative x squared how much is that wait minus x squared plus x squared okay does anybody remember anything about sine of negative X yes that is a property it's a sine of negative X is the same as negative sine of x if you don't believe me look it up that's a true statement sign is when you think about it an odd function it is inherently an odd function because it does this and it does that it's it's symmetrical about the origin right so knowing that signs and odd function says this absolutely must be the case right there sine of negative X has to be negative sine of x it will work out for you so that's true well look what we can do this is equal to negative sine X over the square root of 1 plus x squared which so this is negative f of x so right there is it odd or not if this happens it's definitely all well it's not so odd which is awesome and then we can just do this and go how much is the integral sweet didn't even have to do it how people should we talked about today yeah okay 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 5.1:  Finding Area Between Two Curves
anyhow uh well 5.1 here's the study of how to apply some integrals to real life stuff real life functions in 5.1 what we're going to discuss is how to find the area between two curves it's not difficult it it really isn't uh I'll show you that actually we've been doing this the whole time it's just we had a very special second curve and I'll show you that right now so 5.1 we're talking about the area between two curves here's the idea let's say that for some given invol you have one function that's above another function so here's our typical what I always like to draw for my f ofx and here's some other function G ofx would you agree that according to this graph f ofx is always above G ofx for a given interval and let's define that interval from A to B like we normally do so from A to B F ofx is completely on top of G ofx now what we want to talk about is the area between f ofx and g of X that's what we're trying to find you see we already know how to find the area under F ofx right and we know how to find the area under G ofx we're talking about the area between them how would you go about doing it give me some ideas what would you do go ahead the area ofra the that might seem logical right because we have this whole area that's great that's the area under F ofx true and this area which is G of X well shoot If I subtract them aren't I going to get aren't I going to get is that even the way you say that aren't I gonna get sounds right to me I don't care am I not going to get the area between those two curves I hope so yeah it says take this area subtract that area it's Bas basically like finding the the uh difference between two numbers right you take the large one subtract out the small one in this case we take the upper function that is definitely going to have more area since it's always above G of X subtract the area under G of X that's going to have less area we're going to get a positive area that will be the area between two curves let me make this statement for you if you're finding the area between two curves it will always be positive if you have a negative area you've done something wrong okay your area will be positive so we're finding an actual definite integral between two curves you understand that the difference between what we're doing before this is no longer net signed area because of the way we're going to set it up we're always going to have the top function above the bottom function we're always going to have more area and getting rid of less area so we're going to have something that's definitely positive it'll still work think about it subtract the function on top would have a negative area this would have more negative area you're subtracting more negative area that would become positive area did you get the idea it's kind of cool no matter how no matter what it's going to be a positive area so the idea was I liked how it was said take the area under F ofx and subtract the area under G ofx that's what we're going to do no problem now can we do it with integrals what's the area under F ofx represented as how do you represent the area under f ofx as as an integral how would you do it here okay we say it again at louder integral from where to where sure hopefully you can see that that's the area under F ofx from A to B right at least is what I told you it was and that's how we've been working with this thing this whole time so we have the area under F ofx great minus the area under G of X what's the area under G of x g wait you're telling me it's the same A to B oh that's cool so would you say that that's the area under F ofx minus the area under G of X and that's going to give us the area between those two curves that's exactly what it's going to give you now why is this so nice I made a statement just a second ago you mean it's from the same A to B the interval you could break it apart but also what do you know about two integrals that are from A to B and A to B what can you do with those things you could you could do that that's one way to do it sometimes it's very much beneficial to combine them notice that those were not one-way Street uh properties they went both ways not only could you because you split up an integral by subtraction and addition you can also put them together by addition and subtraction provided they have the same bounds of integration which this has to have if you're going to find the area between them so you can do it this way do an do an integral and find both of them however sometimes not all the time but sometimes it's nice to put them together because you have like like terms you have common things you can put them together and and do that so other way you can see it just like that that's the area between two curves just make one big note here please make this note in order for this to work properly in order for this exact thing to work prop properly what do you know about f ofx and g ofx the bounds are the same that has to happen very good secondly though say what n negative it is non- negative it will be positive very good in order for it to be non- negative though what do you know about F ofx compared to G of X is what I'm trying to get to what now sure F ofx must be greater than or which means on top of f ofx has to be the higher function in order for this to work does that make sense so you have to have your higher function first otherwise you're going to have this reverse situation you take a bigger area from a smaller area is going to end up being negative you get Negative of what you actually want so in order for the story this note says that FX must be bigger than or equal to it could come down and touch it okay it could do that as long as it maintains the the property of being bigger than afterwards so this is possible here's G of X here's F ofx that could happen if this is f ofx and that's G of X that would be fine between here and here f ofx is still on top of or equal to it wouldn't make a difference do you follow me on that the problem you know maybe I'll use different colors so you can see it a little better that would be okay perfect the problem would be this why would that be a problem not specific ones about the other okay so the the purple line is on top of the black line here but the black Line's on top of the purple line here that would be an issue because one of them is not continually above the other one for that whole interval so for this to work for this to work by the way this would be the case this would be if you just did it the way it was F ofx over G ofx it'd be the case of net signed area this would be positive that would be negative cancel it out it'd be gone you get it so for this to work properly for to get the total area which is what we are looking for what you must have is f ofx greater than or equal to G of X for all X in A to B that little e that's like an element says X is a part of that interval in layman's terms this says f ofx is above G ofx for the whole interval did you understand the concept that if f ofx is not on top of G ofx the whole time if it does this then this area would be probably positive but this area would be negative and it would it would get rid of some of the positive area that you're looking for so basically we're looking for the total area notice that we have done this the whole time we really have here's why we've done this the whole time when I ask you to find the area under a curve what you've interpreted that as is the area between FX and what the X AIS the equation for the x- axis is y y z yeah y equal Z so the integral really was a to B of FX DX however think about it it was really zero because that was a second function we've always been finding the area between two curves the second curve was just the x axis x-axis has an equation of zero y equals z so you were subtracting Zero from it which is why we didn't show it also this means that when we went below when we below the x-axis is why I gave you that picture just a second ago is why those areas eliminated each other because one is positive one is negative because the the function flip-flopped what was on top and what was on the bottom does that make sense to you so basically this would have to be written for total area as this function on top and Zer on the bottom and then this function on top and zero on top and and the the function on the bottom which is what gave you that negative from the absolute value to begin with you remember the absolute value basically you could do it this way if this is C and this is a and this is B wherever that happens to be you could go okay from a to c of FX - 0 plus C to B of 0 - FX yes no that says keep the top function on the top here's the top from a to c f ofx minus 0 for xais here is from C to B great Zero's on the top the functions on the bottom notice how what this actually does here is gives you this relationship that we got exactly the same thing from absolute value exactly the same thing this gave you some integral FX look what would happen 0 - FX is negative pull out the negative minus C to B FX DX it subtracted the negative area making it a positive area it changed the sign on it and that's what absolute value would do as well do you see the connection between the absolute value way we did that for total total area and now the idea of area between two curves do you see the the connection if you don't that's okay but I need to know are there questions on it so absolute value said hey just take the area make it positive great that works the same way but area between two curves says hey think of it as two curves think of this as one curve but think of the xais as another curve then the area between two curves become to it becomes the idea of total area it says you take this function on top of that function for this interval no problem and you add to it this function zero on top of this function for this interval and that's going to make it positive that's going to keep come up with total area the same exact way so area of two curves and total area are the same do you see it now that's kind of cool right so now we have two ways to approach that I would suggest that this is probably the easier way to approach that if you know the x intercept that's probably easier than absolute value because you have to think of that but either way is not too too difficult now we have done no examples would you like one all right did you understand everything we've talked about so far yeah are there questions so far you're allowed to ask questions I promise I won't get too mad at you not even mad not even a little fine Mak sense's not I love the disdain with which you asked that word problems are there they're all word problems they have words in there and problems we're going to start off nice and simply u i I'll give you some very easy ones to accomplish and after that we'll have more work involved in them so I want to start you off just basic basic okay so most most of your homework will not look like this uh some of the ones that are like on the first part will it'll just give you a picture and say hey this one's on top this one's on bottom then I'm going to show you a way to find out which function is actually on top so on this I'm going to say find the area bounded above which tells you the function above and bound it below which tells you the function Below on a certain interval very easy to set up that's the one the pictures are going to give you on the homework they're easy to set up they're not bad so we're going to do one of those and then I'll show you how to do something more advanced so find the area bounded above by that function and bounded below by this function on a given interval they got to give you an interval or you have to be able to find one on Z2 you know sometimes for these if they don't tell you what's bounded above or bound below it's nice to draw picture get the idea see which one's above which one's below you don't have to absolutely because I'm going to give you a way to do this uh without having to draw a single picture but sometimes it helps just to make sure you see your head you with me on that okay now I can see which one's above and which one's below that's nicer but you don't have to well hey let's try to set it up we all we need to know for this is where you start where you stop and which one's on top that's basically it so area between two curves says hey where you start come on zero where you end what function is on the top uhuh when it says bounded above it means for the whole interval when it says bounded below it means for the whole interval uh if it didn't say bounded above below we would find those regions and we we'd be able to determine that so bound above by 2x + 5 uh do I add or subtract subtrac yeah you're subtracting remember you're basically taking big area minus small area to find the area between them also I'm going to show you something here that I don't want you to neglect some of you are famous infamous I guess would be the word for neglecting parentheses notice that parentheses not in this case but in some cases will be very important because that sign will distribute if there was more than one term do you follow me on that if I gave you uh X Cub + one for instance there's a huge difference between this integral and that integral do you see it the sign would definitely definitely change so I'd like you to practice putting parentheses just saying hey this is my top function this is my bottom function then if the parentheses don't do anything so what you erase them but at least you don't forget them you got me because that would that would be so horrible to understand this concept which you seem to you know and be able to set the problem up what you seem to and then get the wrong answer that's the worst kind of ignorance oh my gosh being able to do something and not following through and getting it right that's the worst because it's not even ignorance right it's just failure to perform no one likes that so parentheses in this case aren't doing anything we got 2x + 5 - x Cub DX notice how we don't have to have two separate integrals when we put them together like this it just basically becomes one large integral which is great we can we could easily do that it's just subtracting off this piece of the puzzle can you do the integral go for it go for it do the integral evaluate you know how to do this remember that what I'm teaching you now is really not anything new it's just an application of the process application of integrals to find area between two curves the next problem is one you can expect on a test uh this coming test as it were something like the the next one so we we'll do this one be prepared this is kind of an easier example that I'm giving you it's very easy to set up it's all given to you and you can do it very quickly that one has a little more setup and we'll talk about that in a bit so doing your integral here hopefully you were able to come with what which is what I'm going to do 2x^2 over 2 plus 5x don't forget about that 5x - x 4 over 4 yes no now of course the two we can simplify that so x^2 + 5x looks a little funny + 5x - x 4 4 and we're going to evaluate from 0 to four 0 to two there's nice there's no substitution that we needed we can just go for a direct plugging in some numbers so our area is we'll plug in the two subtract when we plug in zero we are going to get zero I'm just going to show it so we don't forget it don't forget to plug in zero because sometimes if you do have some constant in there especially with the substitution it won't be zero but make sure you make a note of that so in our case our area is going to give you how much is all that how much 18 18 more people got 18 10 see four 10 and four 10 watch the negative that subtracts four show hands help me f with this so far cool deal now would you like to try a problem that's a little bit more robust this one pretty basic pretty basic hopefully we're we're all okay with that one now something that's not as basic is find the area Bound by or another way to say that is find the area between these two curves I'm going to give you some steps on how to do that follow these steps to the letter that will walk you through every problem okay follow the steps when it said when it's like this very easy you can set it up from the problem when it's like this follow the steps here's here's the step and a sketch does help if you have a graphing calculator sometimes it does help plug it in find out which one's on top but I'll show you how to do it without a graphing calcular of course first one you know before you can find the area between two curves you got to find where those curves intersect do you notice I didn't give you a range I didn't give you from 0 to two or from something to something that means that this is going to be completely enclosed between some boundary of our curves when that happens when I don't give you an interval you need to be able to find the interval now fortunately it's just based on the X intercepts because that's how our integrals work from x equals whatever to x equals whatever from a to d so step number one is find the x coordinates of where your curves intersect okay tell me how do we find the x coordinates of the intersection of our curves what would you do for that say what y equals z equals zero not quite you're close how do you find out where two curves cross you set them equal you find out where they are equal right where they actually intersect so how you do this set the curves equal to each other not zero but to each other I'll do it that way set F ofx equal to g ofx whatever your first function is equal to your second function because right now U just off the top of your head do you know which one of these is on top of the other one CU I don't just by I mean I can probably figure it out by doing a little math but right now just looking at it it doesn't say it explicitly does it doesn't say hey this one's on top it doesn't say that anywhere so we're going to have to do a little work and this is kind of easier example but most of the time you're going to look at and go I don't know you're going to have to do what I'm telling you to do so take the two functions set them equal to each other so go ahead and do that now I why don't you try to solve it get in the habit of doing that again we haven't done stuff like that in a while here's what I mean by set them equal you take your x^2 in this case set equal to X+ 6 in this case no problem can you solve it yes yeah I sure hope so I sure hope so so this goes back to your algebra days right whenever you see a quadratic you always get things to one side and you solve with quadratic formula or you factor typically factoring is the best way to go you rarely want to complete the square it takes too long and if you can't Factor you use quadratic formula so that's how you complete quadratic so in our case we have x^2 - x - 6 = 0 yes no hopefully factoring is pretty basic on this one you're going to have x - 3 x + [Music] 2 that means x - 3 = 0 x + 2 = 0 stop me if I make a mistake by the way you allowed to do that 3 and -2 how many other people got down to that far okay so your Al algebra still checks out right hey guess what you have right now your balance got your balance got bounds integration where do your bounds start uhhuh where do they stop so automatically you have this you know your integral starts at -2 and ends at three because that's where they intersect that's where your areas are going to start and stop that's going to be enclosed in that graph you got to figure if your graphs intersect two spots here and here and they're continuous there will be at least some area between them unless they're exactly the same curve which they won't be otherwise it'd have an infinite number of intersections right so they're going to have some area between them now it could do this like it could go there could be lots of areas but it will have at least some now if there were more than just one there'd be more numbers here wherever the intersect would give you another range of an integral another balance of integration so this just has one range it's from -2 to three that means we'll only get one integral are you with me on this so I'll say it again because some of I lost you I can see in your eyes um listen when you set two functions equal to each other you find the only places that they will intersect you believe me if they intersect at two spots there's only one region between there if they intersected at three spots there'd be two regions between there they intersected four spots there' be three regions between there that you would have to calculate do you get it and it would might Alternate which is on top which is on the bottom here we only need to figure out for this one which is on the top and which is on the bottom so that brings a step two determine which is on the top which function is on top how would you do that how would you do that say what kind of maybe overthinking it just a little bit let's go back to this where did your integral start where's interal stop would you agree that for that interval one function will necessarily be on the top of another for sure it will not cross because if it cross folks it have another intersection right it starts here it stops there One's On Top one's on the bottom you got me so if one's on the top one's on the bottom for this interval tell me how you find out which one's bigger than the other one plug in a number man plug in a number whatever number you want provided it is within here you don't want to plug in3 or like seven that would be a little silly plug in a number on your interval and it's going to tell you which function is on the top very quickly so which function on the top how you going to do this pick one point on each each interval to plug in there's only one interval here so we only have to plug in one point step number three it this you're you're almost done it's going to be the setup and solve the integral but let's go ahead and I'm going to show you how to do this we already know this is going to be the case I'm going to not complete this integral until we go over here this is just like a starting point for us I want to have -3 to two that's my interval I know that one's going to be on the top one's going to be on the bottom so we're going to take a number and we're going to plug it in oh I'm reversed my bad I'm glad some of you have very good confused faces otherwise I'd be a loss of what you know some be like wait a second wait a second you can't pull that one on I'm just testing you you passed mhm yeah you buy that we're going to test a point what's a good point to test between -2 and three clearly plug in zero so we'll do y = x^2 do down here see a little better y = x^2 Y = X + 6 you said we're going to test zero you're going test zero this is not too hard to test you're just going to plug in a number to see which what the number is so plug in z y would equal Z plug in z y would equal which one is on the top M wait Y what okay so for your interval this is a nice little graphic organizer says what's going to go on the top ah x + 6 what's going to go on the bottom X very good do you feel okay on getting the X plus 6 is on the top of the interval the top of the the graph I suppose for the interval and then x s is on the bottom of the graph for the interval that helps you set it up doesn't it isn't this kind of like a picture of your integral right here says you start at -2 you go to three this is on the top this is on the bottom set it up subtract them and you're good to go but you going feel okay with our our idea here the idea behind it are there any questions before we actually set up integral and do it okay let's let's go for it then okay so our area we already knew that it's going from negative mess that up again -2 to 3 we now know which function is on the top it's the x + 6 so that's going to go first I'm going to get in the habit of putting parentheses around it that way if I have to distribute anything I know my signs are correct minus not not plus but minus we're subtracting big area minus small area if we know what's on top that's set up perfectly for us minus what now don't forget your DX now of course those parentheses don't do much for us in this case it just was a way to organize and say Here's my first function on the top here's my second function on the bottom and then subtract them whatever they happen to be so our integral goes from -2 to 3 of x + 6 - x^2 DX you okay with that one go for for it why don't you find out how much eror we got the basic hard part is over with it's finding out where you start where you stop and which one's on top that's the hard part the integral you already know you mastered integrals you know how to do it at least I hope you've mastered integrals that homework's going to tell me right now right by the way as I'm thinking about it right now before you get going uh notice that if they say find the area that's Bound by a function and the X AIS you would do exactly the same thing only the second function will just be zero remember how we talked about that earlier today so you just have to do the same thing just set the function equal to zero and solve it find out where it's on top where it's on the bottom same idea yes where's that 3 * three oh should be six that's two today I must have a case with the Mondays darn it I hate Mondays oh I just made a mistake that's all fun you have2 two yeah right oh sorry I reading it back now you making me doubt myself Joe come on now no killing me I think that's right it is I'm going about it for I'll other some fractions there yeah I came up with 125 over six yes I show hands how many people also came up with 125 over six let me ask you this question were you okay down to at least here okay good that's the calculus after that make sure you plug the numbers in right watch your signs signs are real pain when you're doing this uh you especially the netive -2 I mean you got to really be careful with that pretty sure I did that right that should be 54 54 + 40 no I'm uh 81 44 that's right are you ready to try another one or there any any questions on that one you feeling good about it feeling like you know how to handle these type of problems so far are you seeing the similarity between what we've done already and what we're doing now the integrals are exactly the same we're still finding areas it's just now I'm giving you two curves to start with but look it makes the same type of integral set harder setup is harder set takes a little more work motion the same mhm now let's go ahead and find the area Bound by y = x cub and Y = X have I given you any bounds of integration here bounds of integration so where you start and where you stop on the x-axis do you know that yet that cludes you in I want to do first then what are you going to do first okay very good now notice something if I gave you a problem this is going to be very too simplistic for you but just watch if I gave you this Bound by the X AIS we just do and that this would be yal 0 in this case you could still follow the steps you could still follow the steps you'd have well it wouldn't be bound though that would be a problem how about uh like that if I ask you to do that find the area Bound by the x-axis and that curve how you would start it out as you would do the same thing set the curves equal to each other just like that see what I'm talking about yes no yeah and then you'd Sol you'd Solve IT x x - 2 = 0 x would equal 0 and x would equal two and in that case well it's going to do the same thing as absolute value would do for you you'd set up your interval from 0 to two and you plug in a number plug in the number one to zero it's zero plug in the number one to this it's almost fell asleep you guys ready are you with me so far so you have two functions right yal 0 and Y = x^2 - 2x if you plug in one y still equals z if you plug in one well you get y = 1 - 2 you get1 which one's on the top zero which one's on the bottom do you see what it's going to do here's what your integral is going to be set up as your integral would be 0 to 2 0 - x^2 - 2x in parentheses because that's going to change that sign the back end how many people were able to follow that one now I went above and beyond all right that was just giving you something a little extra that wasn't even our problem but I wanted to make sure you saw it at least once that way you're like what's that x-axis mean what's that mean it means zero do the same exact thing find out which one's on the top if the Zero's on the top basically it's just going to make it negative it says that your area was below the x-axis and making it negative is going to make it positive negative negative equals positive that's what that's doing for you now let's go back to our original problem it's not going to take us long to set it up so we'll finish it today and then we'll start on something uh a little bit different next time so what did I give you anyway X Y and Y not how about that yeah that's what it was okay if I don't give you bals again you got to find your balance find your balance by setting those things equal to each other that's step number one yes no yep okay have you already solved it yeah so solve it by subtracting the X you're going to get to X Cub - x = 0 Factor it of course you're going to get x * x^2 - 1 keep going zero x + One X - one you get how many points 1 2 3 4 three don't forget about that one x = 0 x = 1 x = 1 I think I have those out of order but those are the three points that you you get raise your hand if you're able to find those three points feel okay with that now when you set this up where's our ultimate interval where does it start no where did it start where's it end notice how what you did you found the only three points in the world where these things actually touch right you found the only points in the world where they can actually B bound have have bounded some area together so negative one starts it one ends it but there's a point in the Middle where it could change remember the graph that I gave you at the very beginning of class where the color switched M that's might be what we have happening right here so you got to check for that so it needs to include that point zero and how many intervals are we actually going to test two intervals typically means two integrals three intervals means three integrals four means four one means one so this means we're probably going to have an integral here and we're probably have a different integral here with just our functions reversed depending on which one is on the top and which one is on the bottom um so for each interval test a point in both what point do you want to test over here and over here probably 12 if I'm testing - one2 y = x Cub when I plug in that2 it's going to give me -8 if I test this in the yal X it's going to give me well this is pretty easy -2 now think carefully which one's on the top this one's actually bigger than that number right it's bigger so this one is on the top X cub and X do you see how this this picture shows you what how to set it up it's kind of nice I would encourage you to use that you don't have to but without drawing a graph that's a really nice way to do it you go okay Starts Here ends there that one's on the top that one's on the bottom you see why that cubes is on the top you plug in any number in here this L points being equal zero that one's always going to be bigger than that one now the 1/2 when I plug in one2 this will be 1 18 and this will be 1 half which one's bigger here x x very good so X is here x cubed is there we're going to do the setup and then we'll end there because I'm pretty sure that you can you can do this on your own but stick with me for the setup at least so let's do our setup make sure it's right before we go we're going to have how many integrals do we have so it's basically like a two-part problem here we're going to have one integral from -1 to zero that's where it starts and stops which function is coming first here x and then what- X very good DX I would typically be putting parentheses around those things but because they're only single terms each we can kind of neglect that we just have X Cub minus the X now you have you're okay with that so far okay what are we going to do now are we going to add or subtract we're combining the two we're basically wanting to say the area here and the area here right I don't want to subtract them I want to add them I'm doing two different problems right now and they have to be done differently because the order changes top and bottom change you have to have twice so big old plus another integral where's the integral start 0 to one of what now just because this goes from 1 to 0 and this one goes from 0 to one you can't combine them because they're not exactly the same function so you have to do two different integrals do this one do this one figure out what it is and then uh we'll start here we'll probably start here next time I'll just start with this integral I'll give you the answer and that'll be our all right so we're on this problem let's finish it up uh we're basically down to the part where we're just evaluating the integrals which is going to stand for the area I think the way we did this was we realized that we need to separate any interval into how many segments you have find out which functions on the top which function on the bottom for each interval and then make up basically one integral per interval so if you look at last time on the video or you look at your notes from last time the way we set this up is we had X cubed on top of X between 1 and 0 and then another interval went from 0 to 1 but X was on top of X Cub so that's where these setups come from at least for finding area between two curves now as far as accomplishing the integrals let's see if we got them right so we got x 4 4 - x^2 over 2 and we'll be evaluating that from -1 to 0 and then we'll have another integral giving us x^2 / 2 - x 4 4 from 0 to one now unfortunately I think I said this last time but I said it as we were leaving unfortunately there's no way to put those together to make one integral out of it even though the bounds match up they really do 1 is z and then 0 to one because our functions are not the same we can't do that feel all right with that so far okay so let's go ahead and accomplish this one and plug in all of these numbers 04 - 02 minus -1 to 4 4 -1 2 / 2 and make sure you have that in parentheses it's important to have that because the sign's going to change this is basically this first one that's what that is then we're going to add to it a whole other one well plug in R1 subtract off our zero force it for us our zero doesn't do anything but I still want to show it because I don't want to lose it in case it did do something a substitution sometimes you'll still plug in zero and you'll still have a number after that how many people made it that far by the way on that cool deal now work through this and try to get some some proper answers this is going to give you zero this gives you 1/4 Minus 12 and it's in parentheses still plus this gives you 12 -/ 14us 0 are we still okay so far all right very good what you're going to get out of that hopefully you're going to get 1/4 did you get 1/4 that's going to change it to positive 1/4 so this segment is 1/4 plus this is going to be Al together you have how many we find area 1/2 which kind of cool when you think about it we're we're able to find now the area between two curves when one of the curves isn't the x-axis we talked about that last time right basically we're doing the same thing finding the area between two curves where one of them was the x-axis now we're saying what if it's not what if it's some other curve it's not that big of a difference all we have to do is make sure we know where those curves intersect that sets up each of our integrals then find out which function is on the top for each of those curves raise your have feel okay with what we've talked about so far all right now I want to show you a couple appliations and another way to think of this concept so basically I'll show you an application and I'll show you one example that we're going to do two different ways one way is going to be the way we've done one way is going to be significantly easier you ready for it yes rock on let's do this thing so here's an application I want you to see this do you guys like racing like cars and stuff I love racing cars personally watching it whatever I'll race anything I I I love doing that so so anyway let's talk about racing cars and to keep it simple we're going to do this you pull up next to me at a red light and then the light turns green and right as it does cuz my reflexes are freaking awesome I gun it and I way ahead of you because my car is fast and I'm awesome so naturally it's going to happen unless you drive a motorcycle you're probably not going to beat me in my car so let's say we do that here's what's going to happen we're going to compare our time to our velocity where do we start if we're to dead stop we're starting at zero both of us are starting at zero and my velocity goes like this I hit my little Peak right and then my I I switch gears or something and then I go that's me this is me and here's you you okay that's you sorry but my car is awesome I'm going to win that race every time notice that the meat what these things are this is a function of our velocities according to time at Time Zero we're to dead stop time one I'm going very fast and you're not fast yet anyway I don't know what card you have I'm just making a joke anyway but these are our velocities this is veloc velocity one or velocity me and this is velocity you two Le the technical ter sure my question is between here where we start and here where the race is over that a or zero and B where the race is over do we have any area between the curves yes the question is what does that area actually represent clearly I won clearly I won because my velocity was quicker than yours this is not position by the way this is not position what this would be if you had a position curve or if you have velocity curve you could integrate to find your position remember that velocity to position you integrate or if you had a position curve you could actually find the derivative to give you velocity make sense so you can get this and this would might be this the function of a a slope of a position curve that's what this is so these are velocities now tell me something we're finding area right area what's the width time what's the height what's time times velocity dist you ever seen that before distance equals right times time right that is an area basically what you're doing in these think back to what you're actually doing what you're actually doing here is finding little rectangles right and adding them all up a little rectangle would be a little piece of time times a little piece of velocity time time velocity is a distance so what this area represents is the distance that I be you the at the end of this the distance between my car and your car do you get the idea that's kind of cool so given two velocity curves we can figure out not only who won the race but how much they won the race by that's neat you can't do that if you just compare the velocities like at the end of the time say oh I was going 120 you were going 105 well who won May probably I won cuz I'm going faster how much should I win by I don't know that you could say seconds right you could say you won by 4 seconds does it say where you were and where I was when I won no but this does this says if I were to find the area between them the area between the two curves so notice here this could be a velocity area is velocity time time that gives you a distance so the area between the two curves is representing a distance between my cars in this case the area equals the distance that car one me is in front of you all right in this case the area represents the distance car me is ahead of car U how would you find the distance how do you find that area our I think we've been doing okay how specifically would you do it you would subract just subtract them oh no I'm kind think how to word how how would you do it come on how would you find an area between two curves set it up where did it start where it start a or in our case if we're a dead stop z z where's it n yeah wherever that time was in our case that's B is going to be time time after 20 seconds or whatever say how far am i ahead of you after 20 seconds that's what this would do for you what's going to come first uh V1 sub v sub1 t or V sub2 T explain why definitely notice that this was kind of a simplistic example sometimes cars go like this right they start off and you have an automatic and I have a I don't know a stick Shi so probably I'm ahead of you and then if we have very equal cars I'm going to shift and you're going to keep going at the automatic you know so we might go back and forth and back and forth you'd have to set up several several integrals to figure that one out you get me every time we cross back and forth that interval would be a different integral that would give you the overall distance between the two cars as we went now if you wanted to figure out another sub Point here figure out the total amount of time that sorry the total distance at the end that I'm ahead of you that would be net change you have just do one integral if you want to find total distance as we went as a like a cumulative effect of how much our cars were apart whether I was in front or whether you were in front that's where you'd have all those different integrals does that make sense the area between the curves would represent the overall distance that we were apart the whole length of time net integral where you just went from no matter what happened here from zero to or from A to B or Z to B that that's going to say at the end of the the game who was ahead that's what that would do you get the difference there so it's it's kind of a little a fine point but it's kind of an important one that's what you so basically the same idea so right now we could think of these things as distances if we really want to if we're racing cars it's kind of cool I just want to throw that in there because I love racing cars that's kind of interesting now let's do one more example because I want to show you a couple ways to think about this do you have any questions on that before we get going I'm guessing your silence says no no all right okay you might not like this example so much but it's good for you to see it because you're going to get some like on your homework so stick with me even if you don't like it stick with me not bad difficult maybe to understand at first after after at first it's not bad okay why don't you like the example so much because solve for y it's not even a function in terms of X is it it's actually a function in terms of Y not in terms of X combined to the function that is in terms of X so that right there goes gosh do we have to have functions not necessarily not if we can break them up in some some manner which is what we're going to do for the first method of doing this secondly I don't tell you much about this I don't say where you start I don't say where you stop I just say do it so we need to find out where integrals start to stop right okay one thing is probably you're going to want to find the intersections because that's going to give you at least some range also a picture would be very very helpful here very helpful we're going to draw a picture first so that you can have a Graphic representation of this um in general you don't need a picture as long as you really understand the Curve cures one thing I'm I'm telling you about is is this if you just do the intersections of the curves when you don't have functions in terms of X you can miss key points uh for instance on the xal y^2 do you know what that is okay not just the square root of x though you remember when you take Square you have it's actually Parabola on its side do you see the parabola on it side what that means is that our curve is probably going to intersect here and here which is what it's going to do we'd be missing that point that point right there is going to be xals 0 the start of your Parabola right so even though the function does not intersect right there that is a key point because on the x axis that's where we're starting so that's a key one so you need to see things like that as well that's what makes this problem difficult let's draw the graphs first that way we can really get a picture of it I'll explain everything I just talked about okay first one x = y^2 if x = y^2 that means that y sorry uh X is a function of Y that means that basically you do this you take your graph and you go and you look at it sideways so if we look at it sideways this thing is actually parabal you okay with that one so far yes no yes the other function the other function is pretty easy other function is a line y = x - 2 can you graph that on the same set of axes okay let's go ahead and do that y = x - 2 says the Y intercept is where ladies and gentlemen where and the slope is those are our two functions would you agree does it have bounded some area within it now let's go go ahead and try to focus on where that area what that area is first thing you're going to notice if I find my intersection points does it tell us where to start and where to stop well does tell you where to start is it going to miss some it's going to miss some area do you see that it's going to miss a lot of area because starting would start here and end here that's that's a problem we actually have to start here which is where the picture comes in nicely or really understanding your graphs you really have to know what they look like you have to know where that thing starts hey I know because I've done this stuff before I know that's starting at xal 0 I know it and it's facing this way so I know that that integral has to start at xal zero I know it's going to end somewhere but I know it's starting right there does that make sense and a picture illustrates it very nicely for you but at least you have to have that picture in your head before you even contemplate this problem now the next thing I told you was okay follow the steps down follow step one which is set these things equal to each other and solve them okay set them equal how are we going to set them equal to each other to solve for y you could solve for y that's going to be a little difficult because you're going to have square root plus and minus for X right maybe solving for x would be the better idea so step number one says all right I have X = y^2 I also have y = x - 2 and I want to find some way to set those things equal now solving for y again might not be the best bet because you have to take a square root with a plus and minus that's difficult to do other way you could do it well this is already solved for X isn't it this one's not hard to solve for x how would you solve that for x so I would say x = y + 2 I reversed them on you but x = y + 2 now you have you're okay with that so far well now that I have x = y^2 and x = y + 2 what do you know can you make a different equation out of that can you solve yeah very easy how would you solve come on tell me the idea is to get everything on one side and then Factor it yes it is a quadratic after all it's in terms of why it's a quadratic and hope that it factors really honestly hope that it factors it doesn't it's kind of a pain if it doesn't really is uh y - 2 and y + 1 is what I got out of that did you get that as well that means that y - 2 = 0 and y + 1 = 0 you're going to get Y = 2 y = 1 by show hands how people feel okay with what we've done so far okay true or false our integral is going to involve the numbers 1 and two okay okay well those are those or that's my question one of them is a bound and one of them is okay I'll give you that zero is going to be one of my bounds yeah zero is 2 and 1 other bounds and negative one is your y AIS bound going downwards and then you have your your two would be your bounds on your xais going to the right okay so that's my question actually you have an integral in ter y well that's my question what are you integrating with respect to the x- AIS or the y- AIS the answer is the answer is either one but you have to make a choice okay either one but you have to make a choice I'm going to show you two ways to do this the first way is saying I'm going to integrate the way we've always done it with the x-axis in this case these numbers really are only there to get you x intercept x x values to get tell you where your integrals start and stop that's it this isn't good enough if we're going to integrate this way so if we're integrating this way it says hey look I basically have three different functions I'm talking about three of them check it out if I'm talking about functions this way I think this as oh my gosh well if I solve this one uh X = Y if I do solve that for y I get plus or minus < TK xal y do you follow me on that this right here because look it if you if you're going to integrate you have to have functions in terms of X you have to if if you're going to integrate X's you got to have functions that work you can't say and plug in one number two things out you got to say here's one curve and here's the other one does that make sense you can't treat it as one big function of X because it's not a function of X what it is is a square root of x here and a negative root of x there can you follow that one you sure no I understand where the two formulas the two different functions from this one and this one I'm not sure I'm following the ramifications of that okay ramifications are you have to go ahead you have to be able to integrate some way if we're talking about integrating with respect to X you have to have functions in terms of X unfortunately there's no way to represent this as a single function of X it's not a single function of X it is actually two functions of x one on the top and one on the bottom Have I Lost You Yet gone over your head by blowing your mind up like a grenade wow that's great little bit it should be just stretch your minds not too far though that been freaky big heads walking out of here anyhow do you see how I'm getting the square root of x and the negative Ro of X we have to break it up into functions of X so this has to be written in terms of X in order for you to integrate it with respect to X they can't have y's in there if you're integrating with respect to X you get me now can you hear me now good so I'm breaking that I'm saying hey xal y^2 no no no take a square root involve a plus and minus and you get plus orus of X plus the of xus of X so those are two separate functions yes very good Square Ro of X and negative Ro of X those are two functions in terms of X and then a third one y = x - 2 that's another function of X so how many do we have all together one 2 3 three functions in terms of X the problem is we are in terms of X what variable do you solve for one can you go and change these into X's using what you know though yeah okay let's do that so for y = 2 xals what for y = 1 xal what four and one how' you get four and one um y yeah perfect exactly right you can do it with the other problem you get the ex you could you could do it from right here as well correct so either one of these things if I plug in y = 2 hey X is 4 plug in y = 1 hey X is 1 you get me on that do it here even and like you said if I plug in two I get four if I plug in negative one I get one it has to work because you said them equal but that has to be the case how many you feel okay on getting the X X bounds now what I'm going to do is change my graph just a little bit I'm going to eras the parts that I don't need because it looks a little confusing to me right now this part is not binding any area if you want to say it that way neither is this part neither is this one neither is that one if you don't mind I'm going to redraw this picture a little bit bigger so you can see it would you be okay with that okay it's clearly not the scale but it's the same idea you see the the curve I'm trying to draw here let's think about what we actually have going on remember we are talking in terms of X in terms of X what's this top function from zero to whatever this point is what's this piece right here what's this piece right here yeah very good now tell me the points where does my functions start at zero good zero we saw that actually basic from the picture or understand that's a parabola starts uh y shaped really going this way a function of Y but starts at zero hey what's that point what's this point we found out they intersect at one and no one and four on the x-axis that's where these numbers are coming back at the Y's the Y said they intersect at - 1 H look at that and two on the y- axis yes that's true we don't care about Y in this context if we're dealing the functions of X we care about X's that's why we had to find the X's I you hope you're okay with that the Y's would have given us something completely different if we did it this way with Y values would have happened this goes one four sure now I've kind of given this away by this picture how many integrals do you need here explain to you why two right two why two 0 to one 1 to four 0 to one 1 to four but why oh your two intersection points only we have two intersection points you explained that yesterday that however many intersection points you have you're going to have theal okay so how many if you consider this as three functions how many intersection points do we have not two I'm holding it up yeah if you consider say three functions look you have two function that's one there's two there's three yeah you have three functions Joe you were going to say something I thought maybe it's you're going to add the areas from X to x - 2 and then X we're going to deal with this as just two basic basic areas but I I want you to see you're kind of missing something you're kind of missing something think about it this way I'll I'll try to lead you to the the answer uh the way integrals work for areas is one function is on top the entire time and one function is on the bottom the entire time three function we have three functions so can one function be on the top the entire time and one function on the bottom the entire time that would only be two functions my question is do you switch functions somewhere yes where do you switch functions so basically look at you have to deal with the top and a bottom right you have to have this the same function for that whole interval so the same function goes the entire top that's great however right here I clearly change functions that necessitates two different integrals CU I don't even have the same function do you get that idea so here's the setup for us setup for us goes and hopefully you can see I want you to help me here integral where does the first integral start very good where's the first integral end good because that's the intersection that's where I'm trading off my two functions in fact if you did it this way and you did what I told you and you had 0 one and four you'd see it you'd see it you'd say oh look at that sare root of x is on the top negative of X is on the bottom do you see it and you did it here what's is on the top for this range square of X is on the top what's on the bottom oh not negative of X but what yeah that shows it I I sore I I told I gave you everything you needed no I really did it's right here you just need to realize what's going on so 0 to you know make a little clear of X zero to where of what xus because you know you subtract top one minus bottom what's the bottom one don't lose that negative otherwise your integral goes to zero we don't want that to happen minus that DX for sure DX would you agree that that integral represents this little area right here big old plus one what what no 0 to one 1 to four it's all right what's on the top now table does it if you want to do it that way I love the table I just made it up like this last class cool x minus minus what parentheses oh parentheses are pretty important here DX sure sure absolutely can you do those two integrals before you do them be smart about it simplify what you can okay don't start just taking random integrals before you start simplifying and putting things together that would be a silly way to go you definitely don't want to start dealing with this with all parentheses you don't want to start dealing with that until you combine like terms which you do actually have here so let's go ahead kind of nice and slowly and think about what we what we're doing we got an integral from 0 to 1 we got aunk xus a of X how much is that hey that makes things easier already 2un plus another integral from 1 to 4un x - x + 2 you see where the plus two is coming from that's a big deal DX let's keep it going you're we on a rule 0 to one how are you going to write that integral x x to the 1/2 very good because then you can use our integration table and and do that probably also you might want to be pulling that two out just for fun you don't have to you can you can surely leave it inside of there that's really a just a prep personal preference the next one I'll have from 1 to 4 but I'll have x^ 12 - x + 2 DX oh x to the 1/2 don't forget we're adding and dividing 3es over 3es so when we're setting I I not put my integration or my evaluation symbols up there yet I want to simplify it first but remember that this is from 0 to 1 and this is from 1 to four so before I plug anything in I'll put move the two up to the numerator that's going to be 4 x to 3 over three and we're going Z 1 plus this is going to be 2 X 3 over 3 - x^2 2 + 2x from 1 to four by show hands how many made down that far hey the rest of it just evaluation plug some numbers in let's see if we can do it I'd like for you to hopefully do it on your own for for stop me if I make mistakes by the way I'm doing something wrong say what where here am I still okay thank so keep going keep going I want to say that's 136 from right here did you make it down that far just to make sure I'm doing it right okay and then all said and done when you're let's see multiply by 2 32 8 40 53 over 6 no 55 6 what six make sure I'm good up to here I got 43 4/3 16/3 um 163 - 136 - 13 okay M by two that's 32 multip by 2 that's 8 32 and 8 is 40 276 what I'm getting okay I need know how many people got 27 six have like a quadruple a quintuple check whatever 276 276 276 I hope not hopefully you reduce that as well nine halves perhaps yeah that's what I count half just making sure 276 well before we reduce yeah 276 okay I three is a common factor let's go back down to our to get that nine half do you see the nine halves yes do you feel okay with our example yes by the way this is the worst possible way you could do this problem the worst why this is very hard this is very hard to split that up in general hard to do easy for this one hard to do in general it's have two different integrals now what I want you to do is face the board turn your head like this seriously are you doing it yeah like this is there one function that's on top of the other function when you're doing this that means you can do it easier with respect to Y than you could with respect to X I'm dizzy now seriously I am let's think about this for a second I I might go a couple minutes over today but you need to see it because we're going to finish this up so my apologies it will not take very long here's an idea for you sometimes you can switch the roles of X and Y let's suppose you had two functions now of course these functions are going to be in terms of Y not in terms of X so it will start with something like x = h of y x = g of Y like that it will be going not according to the X don't care about the X care about the Y it will be going from C to D and the area we're talking about is that area notice that if you put your head like this right takes the place of top left takes the place of bottom but we still go from C to D it's basically like taking this picture and doing this with it like reflecting it across y almost like reflecting across y almost is that g of Y yes our area in this case would be where would it start on the y axis where does it start for here see C where's n d which one's going to come first oh which one's on the top or on right h y so it' be h of Y minus G of y d what d d y terms of Y now terms of Y so basically h of X is to the right h of X is to the right and this of course is if h of Y is greater than or equal to G of Y for all of C to D guys this says the same thing I said for for this type of thing it just says in terms of Y instead of terms of x uh let's go ahead and let's do this setup on on our problem over here I will show you it will be basically very easy the same one as before same one yeah I want you to see that this works out the same now if we're in terms of Y I need you to notice something that this we had this uh we had X = y^2 and we had y = x - 2 you with me if we're going to do this in terms of Y our functions need to be in terms of Y now this one's great we love this one this one's not great explain to me why it's not how do I solve it for terms of Y those would be the two functions I'm comparing if you set them equal to each other I'm going quickly through this because this is exactly what we've done before you're going to get the same exact points that we did before Y = 2 And1 are you still okay with that mhm honestly raise your hand if you feel all right with that cool so now that we have these functions in y we have y^2 here we have y + 2 here is there one function that's completely not on top of but to the right of if you turn your head like this it would be on top of if you have one function that's on the top or on the right of another function okay now from from this way where does it start where does it start where's my integral start it goes from bottom to top where's my integral start where's my integral n so my area is from1 to 2 notice that's from C to d-1 to 2 that's why I had my y's it's in terms of y-1 to 2 the function on the right was y + 2 the function on the left was y^2 Dy yes no feel okay with it so far just use the Y AIS as we would the X you're exactly doing that you just turn kind of but you can't go from left to right you're going from bottom to top so that is that is wrong you can't go from 2 to 1 you have to go from 1 to two so you can't just turn your paper that doesn't work for your balance it works for your functions doesn't work for your balance so be careful with that did did you see the point what I'm trying to make there why is this nicer hey how many integrals two one integral one integral if you do the integral parentheses really don't mean much here you're going to get y^2 2 + 2 y - YB 3 and you evaluate it from 1 to 2 if we do that work it out but you're going to get exactly exactly the same answer you plug in your two uh whatever you get there you plug in your two you plug intive one you subtract them you were going to get nine yeah easier yeah it is it is easier because we have one function over one function in terms of Y but we didn't have that in terms of X so sometimes it would behoove you to really look at your function before you get started you follow me on this how people understood that example feel okay with it so can you switch your variables and deal with this in terms of why then in in terms of X absolutely just be careful be careful with your bounds especially if we're solving for uh functions and Y have your y variables if you're doing in terms of X have your X variables plug them in accordingly and you should have no problem 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 5.2:  Volume of Solids By Disks and Washers Method
so we're at the point of of our of our series here where we do get to talk about applications of what you can do with this today we're going to discuss how you find the volume of certain figures and how you do it with discs and washers now I know you're probably thinking discs and washers what in the world does that mean what do those little washer doughnut looking things and discs have to do with finding volume or even integrals but I'm going to show you that it does it actually does so here's the idea I'm going to try to build this up for you so you kind of understand where this stuff's coming from instead of just give you the formula just like I did for derivatives just like I did for integrals I'm going to do the same thing for volume you follow me now do you remember the raan sums where we took a whole bunch of rectangles and found arbitrary points and then added their areas together yeah okay we are going to do the same thing with volumes you ready for it so I'll try to break it down again it's not going to be too too bad but we're going to talk about first the the volumes by slicing and what that means is what if we did the same thing we did for areas areas we we had this figure the one I draw the time and we sliced it up right and we made lots of little rectangles we made lots of rectangles we added up the widths times the heights of all those rectangles there by getting the areas of the rectangles that's basically the idea that we're going to use only on a volume type application so let's talk about that so right now we'll discuss the volume by slicing is it different liid solids as as a solid figure okay solid figure uh you have we don't mean we don't mean a piece of cake is different than Jello that's I was thinking that's what I mean Jello goes like this putting like this cake sticks together no not that kind of solid I mean like you have this this threedimensional shape that doesn't have any holes through the middle of it okay that's a solid so it could be liquid it doesn't matter what it is it's contained and it does it's not changing shape you understand that's all no holes in the middle of it either so here's the deal let's take some random fig that I'm going to create right now that so that that's maybe the side view of this figure and let's make it three-dimensional is that threedimensional enough for you can you see it okay okay so that's my my figure here's the idea what if we could take and make slices of this this thing if we can find the volume of a slice then we should be able to add all the slices together and find the volume of the whole figure do you see how this kind of parallels the area under a curve idea so we're going to try to find s let's let's make a slice so some random slice of this thing I'll take it here you guys having a hard time doing the whole threedimensional thing M okay yeah it's kind of difficult you get used to it after a while do you see the the slice I'm trying to portray right there so basically this is a weird shaped cake you did a bad job on your cake but takes two planes right two pieces of paper or laser beams or something we have this Nice Slice of this this cake you're going to serf someone your crappy made cake you got it no icing even what kind of a host are you but anyhow that's that's what we're going to do so idea is let's cut this into thin slabs we'll call it a slicing or a slab and we're going to try to use a rem sum use our sums that we used before to set up some sort of integral so this is our idea I'm going to write it out I'm going to try to walk you through this so you understand where is coming from so idea cut into thin slabs then we'll use a remon sum or or our summations so we use our summations to set up an integral you make a little side note here this is much much like the area problem very much only it's in three dimensions so in order to do this though well how do we find I'll kind of break this down so you understand it do you let me start over then do you understand what's going to happen with this slab what's going to happen that slab if it's much like the area problem what's going to happen to that slab to get very very thin very very thin very thin now think of a volume a volume area for you guys typically is base times width time height right but that's only of an of a rectangle it's only of a rectangle and things don't have to be rectangular so I'll say it this way volume is typically the surface area times its length does that make sense so whatever the surface area is or the in our case the crosssectional area times its width so if I found the cross-sectional area so I cut it this like I cut it this way I take my slab out I turn it towards you that's the cross-section can you picture that three dimensionally you cut like here I'm cutting it I pick it up I turn it this way what you're looking at right now is the cross-section if I take the cross-sectional surface area times its width that's going to give me a very good approximation of its volume right if the width of that slab goes like this that gives me an exact interpretation of that volume because it has very little width does that make sense to you very much like finding the area of those rectangles say hey I can find the area now take it to zero that's now an exact area if I add them all together and that's what we're doing here except in terms of volume so in order to do this we need to find the area of the cross-section to do this I mean that we got to find the area of crosssection well in general we would do this I'll try to break down so you see where all this stuff's coming from if we had just a a basic like rectangular prism if we had just a basic do you see the rectangular prism if we had just a basic rectangular prism and it was I don't know going through through some axis like that like maybe the x- axis if we wanted to find the cross-section well what we would have to do is take a slab or take a slice to find the area and we' slice it like this oops that's way off there we go we do some sort of a slice now tell me something if this distance is X it's on the x- axis and this distance is let's say oh what did I call it I think I call it y for that and this distance is y and this is z could you find the surface area of the cross-section would it have anything to do with X what would it have to do with Y and Z just Y and Z for the crosssection so so check this out if I asked you to find the volume of this whole thing here's how you do it you'd probably say oh well I know the volume of a rectangular prism the volume of a rectangular prism is just the base time the height time the width so so basically it's the y * the Z times the X do you follow me on that now I'm going to kind of prove to you that this is the cross-sectional area times the length you do you agree that this is the volume of this figure no matter what what's y * z y * Z is the surface area of the crosssection that's that's what that is so basically this says oh that's the surface area of the crosssection time x the length so this is surface area of cross-section and that's a length well now now here's the idea if that's the case then what we're basically doing here is making a whole bunch of these things do you see it making a whole bunch of those things and then adding up all the volumes very similar to making rectangles for areas oring rectangular PRS for volumes and we're going to add them all up so what the idea I needed to get across to you was that a volume is basically a surface area time length how many people feel okay with that surface area time length gives you the volume good deal now we can solve any volume where the solid is bound by planes that are perpendicular to the x-axis here here let me let me explain it to you if this was like this and it was not straight up and down could you cut it into slabs it wouldn't work right it wouldn't be a slab to start with that would be a problem here slabs yes slabs that are perpendicular that's very nice and easy we can do that so now we we we've got it down to if our sides are perpendicular to the x-axis we can start cutting it into slabs and approximating approximating our rectangular prisms do you see that the point if they're not perpendicular x-axis then this method is not going to work for us we have to do something else but if the sides are perpendicular we're good to go so now we can find the volume of any solid that's Bound by planes that are perpendicular to the x-axis you know I probably should say at points A and B so at at where we're starting and where we're stopping so if we only wanted to find the volume between here and here it would just have to be perpendicular at those points the rest of it really wouldn't matter just like the area under a curve doesn't matter if it's undefined it's just between the two intervals that that we talk between the interval that we talked about are are you foll me on that one so be at points at points a [Applause] basically where you start where you stop would you like to see how to make this integral up it's kind of cool it's kind of fun I think you'll enjoy it there's going to be a lot of picture drawing well to start off with a lot of picture drawing you ready for it sure I'm going to go back to this because I really don't want to draw that anymore are you guys all right with that I don't want to draw that uh it's kind of annoying so let's just say that from this picture I'm going to go back and you already know the idea I'm going to be cutting a whole bunch of slabs out you know maybe a little redraw it darn it yeah I'll redraw it cuz I have to talk I talk about other things plus I'm going to reverse it because it's easier to draw the top of it as at an angle so let's say that I do same idea but I do this one that's a little off there and I'm going to try to give you every step along the way so my first goal I'm going to cut into slabs okay slabs okay there's one I'm going to cut another one there's two I'm going to cut another one you see my slabs yes no I'm gonna cut all of these so dot dot dot all the way down my figure I'm going to cut this into a whole bunch of slabs and I'm going to do it this way I'm going to cut the slabs so that they're the same width this is going to make it easier to add together just like we did with the area problem I hopefully you're seeing the similarities between this and the area problem so I'm going to cut into slabs the same width how did I represent the width of my areas and how am I going to represent the width of my slabs yeah do you remember that we used Delta X to represent the width of that that little sub interval so I'm going to cut this into slabs Delta X yde so all these little little intervals all those little Cuts those slabs are all Delta x what you still so far so good yes no okay now would you mind if I took one of those slabs and just kind of blew it up not like but like made it bigger guessing some of your wishing we could just blow it up huh yes no more math too bad for you this is two dimensional you cannot blow it up maybe you could I bet you want to anyway I'm take one of these guys one of these slabs and make it quite a bit larger oh ran out space let me RW pretty close do you see it but I'm trying to get across to you oh this is going to be difficult not too bad so I've taken one of these slabs right here and I've made it just bigger so you can see a better picture now can you remember what we did on the area problem I cut each one into intervals what did I do within each interval someone tell me what did I do wasn't necessarily in half but you're on the right track arbitrary Point arbitrary Point great you guys both had the same time so I'm going to pick some random point I could put it in the middle it's going to look like it's in the middle but it doesn't necessarily have to be in the middle explain to me why the arbitrary point doesn't have to be in any particular Point taking limit it's going to do that yeah so wherever it is it's going to be within there right but it's going to be so darn close to everything else it's not going to matter where it is so I'm going to pick an arbitrary Point what did I use for arbitrary point do you remember X XK dot or c subk one or the other I'm going to use XK do because that's what I grew up with so arbitrary Point XK dot or C subk doesn't really matter um on the interval okay okay so that means that down here I'm gon to go all right on my width this is my sub interval that's Delta X this width is Delta X do you guys understand that this Delta X on this let's see Delta X all the way to the bottom Delta X on this little sub interval I am going to pick some arbitrary point now Sarah said the middle I'm going to put in the middle it doesn't have to be there just so we can see it easier I'm going to pick some random arbitrary point XK dot now think back to the area on the area problem when I found my XK dot what did I do with that XK dot remember the area problem you had the width right the width was very easy what were you missing what did I do with the XK dot the function and that gave me my height height now what I'm looking for here please please watch this I hope you're you're seeing the parallels here what I'm looking for here is not the width the width is going to be easy the width is going to be from A to B because it's it's bound it's bound by planes like this it's going to be from A to B this is not what I'm worrying about what I'm worrying about is this part this part is my cross-sectional area so what I'm doing here the width is easy the W width is Delta X in general it's going to be from A to B that's easy part in an integral that's very easy A to B no problem what I'm caring about is how in the world do I find the cross-sectional area because when you think about it this is not a rectangular prism prism this is going up at an angle right so what I need to do is find some place to get the cross-sectional area the place I choose to find my cross-sectional area isn't this far right right one or this far left one necessarily it's some arbitary point XK dot we just talked about how XK dot really doesn't matter cuz I'm going to smash them together so XK dot simply allows me to find my cross-sectional area of each sub interval say that one more time so you get it arbitrary Point what we're doing with the arbitrary point is finding the cross-sectional area right there that's the way that we're going to find the well the cross-sectional area surface area that way I can multiply it by its width again the arbitrary point doesn't matter because when I take a limit of it it's all going to smash together anyway so this point says hey find cross-sectional area at XK dot so pick an arbit Point arbitrary Point XK dot on each sub interval and find cross-sectional area at that point cool that means to me that I'm going to go down here and I'm going to do this my purple line my purple line that goes around that that's my cut at XK dot do you see that what that's going to create is just some surface area for me yeah you know so we're going to find the cross-sectional surface that's cross-section cross-sectional surface area at that point again it doesn't matter where it is since Delta X is going to become really small doesn't matter so let's see oh we're about ready we're about ready can I work over here so I don't get all bound up you don't want to get bound up in calculus calculus constipation then you're bound to get a brain fart get it that was pretty funny come on brain fart lose it on I just made that up that deserves more than your courtesy that was good just think about that later watch the video again it'll be on I'll leave it on there for you so you can enjoy that over your two-day break what's uh V subk arbitr Point nope that's XK dot what's v subk what's v volume volume subk means of whatever little interval I'm talking about you get it so this is every little interval so the volume at the first interval or second interval is going to be equal to well the area at x k Dot times what do you think times what what am I doing up here how do you find volume again what how do you find volume what are you what are you doing for volume we're we're beyond that yes it's length time width time height for a rectangular prism we do not have one of those here surface area times width or length yes that's what we're doing so the surface area is the area at XK dot do you get it that's what I'm trying to represent here the area at XK do the surface area times the width how long is the width very good Delta X this is cross-sectional area times length just like we thought of it cross-section are times L now how many intervals does this stand for one arbitrary interval very good so the this is just one interval how do I find all of them so basically I'm just talking about one slab right now how do I say I want to do all the slabs a sum let's add them all together so if we say okay this is one SL then this if I drop the K I say oh if I want more than one slab I'm going to have to add them all up starting at the first one and going through the nth one that should look familiar it's just like ARA right now only inside of it says oh find the area at XK dot time Delta X hey that's just for each one what this says is take every slab that you have every slab find a random point for each slab find the area of the cross-section at each random Point multiply each one of them times its width and add them all up that should give you an approximation for the volume approximate volume okay now you use your Calculus how do you make it better take liit as very good did you hear him over there said take the limit as n approaches Infinity that's going to say instead of a finite number of slabs which would be a pretty good approximation making an infinite number of slabs if you pack an infinite number of things into a finite space it moves it really close to zero doesn't become zero because you have to have some sort of length don't you if Delta X were zero you get a volume of zero that wouldn't make any sense you have to have something there but it's so small that it's not going to be an approximation anymore it's so small that that's going to be exactly what the volume is so yeah exactly take a limit so this is an approximation how I make it exact is I go all right take a limit as n goes to Infinity of the same thing that we had and I'm hoping you can figure out what what comes of this I think I told it to you before what's a limit of a sum what's a limit of sum that's what it is it's the interal we'll be we'll be doing these through using interal through well I'll explain that in just a bit okay just understand that this is going to give you an integral from where you start to where you stop where A and B are the starting and ending points of your volume and they have to be perpendicular to the xaxis otherwise you can't make slabs follow me a of x k dot becomes a of X the area function of your of your function and then the Delta X becomes DX and a of X is the cross-sectional area over the interval from A to B would you wish I feel okay with what we talked about so far now are you going to have to do ran sums no I'm just proven it to you why would you do Ron sums that's way easier shoot don't go that whole process but I proved it to you didn't I showed you how this all works that way when I give you this you're like that doesn't make sense well yeah it does it actually does it says this is cross-sectional area with whatever the width is and you're adding them all up from A to B that's all it says it's just a different way to say this right here easier to calculate though because you know how to take an integral don't you yes awesome U by the way does it have to be along the x- AIS no oh yeah did you have any questions on this I don't do it on purpose I think IW it yeah no see me after we could probably do the same thing according to the y- axis except except instead of being perpendicular to the the X it just be perpendicular y turn your head it's got to be that way so we do the same thing with respect to y so in our case the volume would equal hey where would you start where would you stop C or D C D C small to big of whatever the H whatever the area of the crosssection was according to Y and then you'd have D yeah that would be it s DX just checking sure sure you're awake good yeah Dy it's such a habit to put the DX isn't it you always want to put that but watch watch your variables so basically what this says in English is the volume of a solid is found by integrating the cross-sectional area from A to B that's what that says in English the the volume is found by integrating the cross area area of that cross-section of a threedimensional space from well C to D in this case or from A to B would you like to see an example about how this is done it's kind of cool it's not not too bad let give you this one sorry for those of you who are not thre dimensionally inclined these are probably really hard to draw so my bad well actually your bad I'm not the one screwed up I really am kind of a nice guy out of class but you wouldn't know it would you all the jerk things I say uh this is a one here and a five one and five now would you like to see how this is done appropriately firstly we're going to have to find now this is kind of a these are simplistic examples to start with just so you know very simple why are they very simple might make it complicated I'm going to make it complicated yes why is this simple does the function ever change no it's a uniform function the whole way okay it's going to be uniform U aerial cross-section the crosssection cross-sectional area the whole way through so what we know is that the volume is going to be the integral of the cross-sectional area from where the function starts and from where the function stops now first thing does this qualify do I have planes that make 90° of the xaxis or the Y axis one or the other yeah this is this is 90° and that's 90° so that's that's great that's what we need can you please tell me what's the area of the cross-section how are you getting that well you got to Circle at one end and that's your sure so if we cut this thing right down if we cut this and then turn it and look at it that's going to be a circle do you see the circle so the circle is pi r s cool okay in our case what is it how much is the pi r s what's the r uh the radius sure one the radius is one radius go well can you see the radius is one diameter is two radius has to be one so for us it's Pi 1 2 would you all agree that the cross-sectional area of this figure is simply Pi yes and it doesn't change there's no X involvement because it doesn't change it says it's a constant it's a it's a circle stacked up right next to each other so what our our Theory says here is that the volume should be equal to an integral from where it starts where does it start along the x- axis where does it start I'm start okay one to where of the cross-sectional area DX because we're going along the x- AIS that's an X so P how many people feel okay with this so far cross-section area it's just the area of a circle that's Pi in this case radius is one that is crosssectional area that's a constant there are no X's because it does not change if it changed we would have X's for sure it' be a function in terms of X now we're going from 1 to five because it's a restart there a restop there where our planes are perpendicular no problem hey can you find integral of Pi DX not too hard what's the integral of Pi DX Pi with the little thing that's the evaluation symbol from where to where so this says Pi * 5 - < * 1 what's < * 5 - < * 1 4 Pi that's kind of neat we just used well it is neat Until you realize you can do this without calculus but it's kind of neat that you're able to find the volume using calculus now let's just be clear that this is true because this is simply a cylinder right what's the volume of a cylinder High squ height hey think about think about what you're doing okay think just think the volume of a cylinder is the base area times the height you basically Stack Up circles that is literally exactly what we're talking about here it's the area and you stack up all the circles that's what we're doing same thing so it should work out the same thing volume is 5 * 1^ 2 * height the height in this case is really the length was 5 - 1 that's four huh 1 s is 1 * 4 is 4 45 this might not seem so impressive to you but getting the same answer is kind of neat right now unfortunately for unfortunately these don't always happen right you're not always going to get that formula now he's going to get that did you understand that so far though now we can just take it a step further we're still kind of basic basic okay we're going are we going slow enough for you yeah you understand everything right this slow up then we're going to start talking about some more unique shapes not just cylinders but we're going to get some some other things so what we'll do now is say let's suppose you have some function and you start revolving it around an axis do you see that it's going to create a solid The Sweep out area is going to create some sort of a solid you with me let's let's get a picture of those before we do anything too drastic let's see what they're they're making and what we're going to call this subsection is a solid of Revolution a solid Revolution means the solid you get if you take some like a piece of paper or solid shape and revolve it around an axis you're going to get a solid of Revolution let me give you a for instance here if you took that shape and you what is that shape this you took that shape and you revolved it around the x-axis what's it going to make so basically you do this you'll sweep it out that's a horrible idea in see if I can find something better this is much more there now you see it take it revolve it that's just created a cylinder in space do you see the cylinder in space open right to the right page too awesome so this if I did yeah that's going to create exactly what we had right here this is basically a rectangle that's sweeping out an area an a solid Revolution sorry a volume out volume so this would create this shape basically I didn't draw it very nicely but it creates that cylinder that we were just talking about well I really jacked That Thing Up forget this hang on I got to make it nicer for you guys than that that's basically the shape that you get what about this so what if I took that yeah if I took a half circle and I revolved it I'm not going to get a half sphere am I full sphere which means that to get our our solids you can still deal with a function because if I took a full sphere and revolved it sorry a full circle and revolved it it still make the same exact shape actually some people would say Well it sweeps out twice the volume because have twice the sides but it makes the same exact overall shape it makes the sphere still so this if I did yeah sure I'm going to get GL not an egg if it's a half circle I bet hopefully it's a it's a sphere what if I took this figure what would I get if I swep that around [Music] mm sure it's going to give me a cone absolutely I about one more it's kind of a fun one yeah I'll [Music] how about that a donut what do you think another with the hole so a paper towel roll you basically get a paper towel roll that's what you get you're going to take this solid thing and sweep it around but there's a hole in the middle of it so dut I couldn't say yes because Donuts have it's actually called a Taurus they have curved sides you can't do that this will have the straight side still because you're sweeping that out it is rectangular but it's going to have this hole right in the middle of it so this would be basically a cyinder within a cylinder you sweep out this you leave this you see the figure I'm trying to draw for you it's that threedimensional the solid space is actually this and this and this empty the empty cylinder in the middle doesn't contain anything you have to swept anything out for that now the reason that we're going to go a little further is these shapes are pretty easy these These are easy these we have standard formulas for this this would be hey cylinder this is sphere we have formulas for the volume of the sphere we have formulas for the volume of the cone we have formulas for this it's a cylinder minus cylinder that that's all that is what we don't have formulas for as a Where I Leave You is this what if I said now what I'd like you to do is take my favorite function from A to B and sweep that thing out now that's not a regular shape that actually has a curved Edge so I can't use any of those geometrical principles but what if I did that well do you see the picture I'm going to get kind of weird looking that's kind of like that isn't it basically a base basically this and it's also a basee from A to B now two questions before I let you go number one thing is it still a solid yes cool number two thing are the sides still perpendicular to the x-axis which is cool which means that we're going to be able to use this stuff that we talked about to do something like this and that's what we'll start next time all right well we're going to wrap up talking about volume of these threedimensional objects which is a really cool idea what it says is that if f is firstly continuous and if it's bounded between a and b bounded between a and b and we rotate it around the x-axis well if you think about that picture as bounded by by A and B another way to say this by the way if you get this on your homework notice that you could get instead of bounded by A and B it could say say bounded by y = sorry x = a and x = b are you okay with that x equals A and B are vertical lines are they not that would be bound between those two vertical lines vertical lines are perpendicular to the x-axis so if we have a continuous bounded function between a and b and we rotate about the x-axis it will have sides that are perpend to the X and this implies that we have a solid that's been rotated around the x-axis using that we can talk about our solves of Revolution we just talked about those last time we talked about cylinders we talked about the uh rectangle rotated around the xaxis Mak cylinder we had that paper towel looking thing right toilet paper looking thing where we rotated a rectangle that was hovering above the x-axis we had a cone we had a sphere we had those shapes now it says well if you have just some random function f ofx as long as it's continuous as long as it revolved around the x-axis in such a way that sides are perpendicular to the x-axis we should be able to use some method in order to calculate that volume would you like to find out what it is sure it's kind of cool and I don't think it's going to take too much for you guys really to get did it um what I'll do first is draw you a picture of the Revolution so I'm going to draw this in three dimensions or try to at least that's close enough feel look with the shape see where it's coming from so rotating that solid sweeping out the whole volume question so the sides that are think there the the front the back that's what you mean I mean the front and the back that's exactly right so right here this is perpendicular it looks like it's a little curve but that's just because I want to throw the show the three dimensions but if we had this thing here it'd be it'd be completely fat flat just like a vase sitting on a table right it's it's flat and it's flat it's the plane is perpendicular to the x-axis right now are you all right with that now questions I have for you uh first question put something right in the middle what's that point say it again yeah exactly if we have something starting a ending in b the threedimensional space should also start at a and end at B that's sure for sure next question I have for you oh this is a little off isn't it that's a little better if I were to take this figure and I were to slice it because that's what we're about to do is find the volume by slicing if I were to sliced this just right right in the middle like this slice right there what is the cross-sectional shape going to be Circle why a revolution and both sides are perpendicular okay very good so we have a circle you understand that right now let me ask a question is this some random function or is this a specific function have I used like x s have I used any specific function here I just took a general curve so my question is if I take any continuous curve between a and b and I revolve it what's the cross-sectional shape always going to be Circle always going to be a circle you understand that if I take a a shape and I revolve it it's going to give me some Circ circular or C yeah circular slicing that's kind of interesting right so every one of these if I look at the slice it's going to have a distance what do we call that distance if this is my my shape what do we call that say what radius that's right now what we're going to do is we're going to find the volume by slicing here is the idea that we came up with last time what we came with last time is that the volume should be some integral of the surface area from A to B across my interval do you remember doing that from last time refresh your memory on your notes or or the video that's what we came up with from our Sol Revolution we said hey length time width time height is great but we don't always have the same length time width time height so what we're going to do is say hey let's just find the the surface area of a cross-section and we'll integrate it from A to B what that says is that the surface area can change shapes and sizes because we have a variable in there we just need to find a function that represents that Sur liate again we need to find a function that represents that surface area and then we can integrate it integrate it is just adding up all those little slices from here to here do you follow me on that so we'll slice them all up real fine like real nice and then add all those things up that's adding all the surface areas of each little slice from A to B that's what that means tell me will feel okay with that so far all right that's the idea now we're going to get a little bit more specific I'll walk you through every step firstly note the a ofx represents the surface area of the cross-section you okay with that area equals the surface area of the cross-section that's what we mean there now we just talked about this this is the cool this is the cool part oh my gosh this is a really cool part actually the surface area of the cross-section what is the cross-section what was that shape that we just talked about ccle ccle very good that's PK r s that's a circle note that anytime you revolve something around the x-axis the cross-section will have have to be a certain you're not going to do this you're not going to go uh revolve Square no that doesn't work right when you revolve something you're you're evenly re rotating it around so it's going to sweep out a circular pattern that's what it's going to do whether it's really big or really smaller changes the cross-section at one cutting is going to be a perfect circle you follow me and the area the perfect circle is going to be P Pi R square whatever the r happens to be now let's talk a little bit more about R from here how in the world are we going to find R because we would definitely need R up here wouldn't we definitely need R what is our R don't don't think overthink the arbitrary Point thing we're a little bit past that that's how we came up with this idea was arbitrary point at each sub interval and then taking it to Infinity so we have very little width between there it's the the r is okay think about r as being perpendicular to the xaxis then R is the same thing is the height of your function at any given point x right so that you know that your height here is just F ofx if this were some point and now maybe I see what you're saying if you pick some point x sub one then the height of that one point is f of x sub1 or the same thing at the as the radius at that point so here's what I'm going to say if this is a circle then the radius of that Circle has to equal F ofx at any point x yes no the is is the is the radius the height of your circle at this point the radius is the height of your circle right and changes depending on where your X is the radius would be here the radius would be here that also is exactly the same thing as the function the height of the function so what I'm trying to get at is just just look at the board here real quick the height here which is the function's height is the same as the height here which is the radius is that true therefore the function equals the radius that's another way to look at it so radius equals the function well that's kind of cool that let us make a substitution if we have a subx which doesn't make sense right now because that's not in terms of X is it and we needed it in terms of X so a ofx = PK r² a ofx = < not r because R is not in terms of X right now we need to make it in terms of X what's going to do wi in there and then what very good how many able to follow that hey guess what you're done you're done that is the method cuz look what we were looking for is a of X the area in relation to some variable X and now we have it this is in terms of x what it says is in order to find the volume by slicing you go from where the interval starts to where interval stops of Pi FX s DX and it says you know what it's not even that hard it says you take your function you plug it in you square it and you multiply by pi now someone tell me something about the pi what can you do with the pi you can always bring it out because that's a constant that will always be there I show it here so you don't forget about it but you can easily pull that out of your integral this right here this is called the method of diss why are they called the meth method of diss do you think making SES in a circular object yeah which is a disc you're basically adding up adding up discs circular you're adding up discs that's why they call the method discs now would you like to see an example yes okay let's do a couple of them first one's going to be real basic basic here's how some of these things are worded find the volume of the solid of revolution where I'm going to give you some function let me give you some interval is revolved around the x-axis so we're going to find the volume of the solid Revolution that means we're going to be revolving something of Y = 3kx on the interval 1 to 4 and that's being revolved about the xaxis so we're going to be making some circular shape it's roled around the x that means it's can have perpendicular sides which means we can do the slicing thing if we had this we couldn't do the slicing thing because we won't be able to make circles we have to be able to make circles for this to work you got it that's what where the perpendicular comes in now also this could be this could be worded a little bit differently I need to be prepared for that I'm not going to write out but you can you can hear the difference this could be worded in a manner such as this find the volume of the solid of revolution of the area Bound by y = 3 < tkx x = 1 x = 4 and the X AIS does that make sense to you it says take it between this function whatever this function happens to look like it looks like that about the x = 1 x = 4 and the xais that comes up with the same exact area that you're going to be sweeping out you see the point so it can be worded differently don't let the wording Jack you up it's going to give you balance it's going to give you a function and we're revolving that so again this could be written just like this how I'm going to hopefully word it for you or it could be written find the the volume of the solid Revolution that is bound between this y x = 1 x = 4 those are your vertical lines and the x- axis that's your horizont or yal Z could be the x-axis as well you okay with that so far so that's the picture we're going to have we're going to take this thing and spin it around now we go real slow and see if we can do this together so we know that volume volume is some integral from A to B of Pi fx^ 2 DX let's see if we can fill that out appropriate thing where is my integral going to start do you think very good where's you going to stop what's going to be inside of my integral first thing oh yeah you're certainly going to have a pi for sure that doesn't change and then you're going to have the function f ofx now in our case what is f ofx 3 rootx very good so we'll have 3 rootx and what do I do with that 3 rootx do I know mhm notice how the three is with that rootx in this case because that is part of your function right you're squaring the whole function so we have our PI we got our PI we got our F ofx that's 3 rootx got our Square don't forget the square last people forget the square can't forget the square don't forget the square you feel okay with this so far notice how the integrals are going to be not so bad well sometimes they are a be I'll give the honesty sometimes they're nasty because you're squaring function I mean if I had given you like x^2 - 3x + 4 we had to square that that's not that fun uh but this one's going to be at least a little bit nicer you can see it right so don't forget to square it what we'll get is 1 to 4 Pi tell me about this what happens there say what now both parts not just the square root but also the three so what are we going to get that was pretty nice see how nice of a guy I am today told you I was in a good mood yeah we get 9x see where 9x is coming from tell me something else I can do with this integral good I'm going to pull up both the nine and the five from 1 to four of X DX no substitution necessary nothing hard don't make these harder than they have to be if you can do an integral without a substitution and it's fairly easy do it okay do that don't trick yourself on these problems you're going to get 9 pi times what so we'll be evaluating from one to four you know I'm going to show you a slightly different way you can consider this this is another way you can do this problem instead of having the the two here with the four and the one you know that's a constant right you can pull out those constants before evaluation so here I could write this as 9 piun / 2 * x^2 from 1 to 4 that's also an appropriate way to write it so you could just look at something a little bit smaller there you just have to not forget about the 9 Pi / 2 but when you do you're going to get 4 2 - 1 2 that's going to be 15 hey it works if you do it that way of course it works if you do it that way it has to be the same yeah it's going to work either way don't forget the pi too I don't want 135 over two don't forget that Pi that changes things what did we just find by the way volume that space I drew before that's being rotated around the x-axis it was it'd be easy to find the area but now we can find the volume how we're doing is we're saying okay all we're basically doing is this finding the height of the function at each point revolving that height around it's making a dis and adding up the surface area of those disc that's what that's doing how many people understand this example now would you like to do something a little bit cooler this is pretty cool already but what I want to do now I want to see if we can come up with the formula for a sphere by doing some of this calculus stuff you ever found out you ever know I mean I'm sure there's many ways to come up with a formula for the volume of the sphere but have you ever thought about actually how they did it how would you do it take take this sphere and say hm well that's got to be uh 4i R Cub over three obviously I mean clearly if you have a sphere that's going to be the volume right which is the volume of I think it is 4 pi r Cub over three should give you a volume of a sphere so how do they find that how would you find it would you actually cut up a sphere and try to organize it into rectangles and add them probably not water displacement you could do that you could definitely do water displacement as long as you know the exact value of Pi which no one does but then come with a rectangle that has that exact thing it's going be hard to do probably estimate it yeah probably estimate it but to get an exact wait why don't we use some calculus and figure that thing out let's see if we can find derive the volume of a sphere you ready for this sure this is good stuff to me the first time I saw this I was like dang that's pretty cool I thought that was really interesting now let's think about how you would get a sphere what shape would you have to revolve around the x-axis in order get a sphere half circle why not a full circle because be redundant it would be redundant it would say well I I don't need that extra part just a half circle would do it wouldn't it take a half circle revolve it all the way around it's going to create a sphere so let's start with that all right try to do it twice and look about the same must be the way I'm going to do it okay so we don't need this bottom part we don't we don't need this but that's what it's going to create is this bottom section when I sweep it around it's going to create some sort of sphere how far is this and how far is this from each other no I mean how how far what's the coordinate of that x coordinate Z z r would be I'll give you that z r is this one that's R how far is this one how far is this one Whatever the radius is That's How what it happens to be so notice that the the only the only two things you know about circle is where the or where the center is and how much the radius is and we know the center is at 0 0 these that's what we're implying and the radius is R whatever R happens to be I can't say one I can't say two cuz it's would only be the volume for that specific sphere I want to find the volume of any Sphere for any radius and that's what we're doing right now so we know this is netive R to R and this is R High whatever that happens to be at its highest point oh question how do we find a function see we need to find a function don't we to be able to integrate this thing we got to find a function what's the function for half of a circle what's the function for half a circle do you know the equation of a circle what's the equation of a circle then you mumbling you're guessing it you're guessing think I know say what now X Y squ yeah you kind of need to know that one how you get circles X2 + y^2 equals radius squ very good now what variable denotes our function in terms of X here what what variable what variable would you need to solve solve for to say hey here's a function you solve for y yeah very good to say here's a function of X you solve for y right R is going to be a constant for whatever type of sphere we're going to have okay so we're not going to be dealing with r as a variable R is just going to be whatever radius is so in our case we'll solve for y hopefully you can see this we're going to subtract x s and then what are we going to do now if you square root it you would get that yes no tell me something about this which one don't we need yeah actually you could take either one of them but you don't have to have both if you had both it would have the whole Circle so what I'm saying is that the solid one that we have is the plus version the dotted one we have would be the minus version do we need the full circle to make the sphere no we don't no we just need one of them so take either one the negative one or the positive one I prefer the positive one because well that's easier to deal with so we're going to go okay even though it has this plus minus we'll consider this to be the upper half circle you know what that's about all the all the setup we're going to need to do do we have a function that has x's in it do we have a starting point and a stopping point yeah let's set up our our integral we know the volume equals let's do this where's my integral start ladies and gentlemen where does it end R okay what needs to go on the inside of our integral remember that well now here's an interesting interesting concept do we have planes that are perpendicular to binding my yes or no it actually stops doesn't it and at that point so this point consider the tent you could consider a tangent at that point yeah but it actually stops it it stops right there it doesn't go it doesn't lean in do anything like that but it tangentially yes we have those those ending points as well so it touches that one point is perpendicular so it does fit this it means we can slice it into little bitty circles is the limit of it no it it could it could be angled downward as well as long as it doesn't do this here's the difference it can do this could do that what it couldn't do would be this it could do that it can't come back on itself but it can't as long as it's going outward yes because you'd be missing this this volume okay that's what you'd be missing do you see the point there literally do you see the point she be missing you'd be missing that piece the little would get locked off because it takes it to the perpendicular so this one when you went down like this it's fine you're not missing any everything's encompassed it's all in there yeah it's cool uh you can create little little slices but this one you'd need a separate uh way to do that and that would be with washers as we'll talk about a little bit that would be two different integrals you see the point okay so yeah this one works because yes technically it's you don't have planes which incorporate your function and a perpendicular but if you have perpendicular uh boundaries of your function which is great that's what we need now okay what's on the inside let's go quickly Pi I'll give you the pi what else do we have in there parth bracket okay bracket I like the bracket why do we need the bracket we're going to square something we're not going to forget about it so we're going to square it right now and have a DX on outside of it saying whatever's in there whatever want to put my function it's got to be squared what's my function told you I'm a nice guy today nice guy good numbers so this is an integral from r to R of Pi great what happens here do I sell any parentheses I'm still multiplying by pi so yes I do still so far so good okay what now you could pull the pie out sure if you'd like to do there's a couple options that you have right here on doing this intergral one of them will be to distribute that and separate your integrals into two integrals and then pull the pi r s out and pull the pi out of the the second integral with the x s or you could treat it this way doesn't really matter show hands how people can make it down that far right with it now here's where you got to be careful what is the variable that we are integrating with respect to so that means we treat r as a constant value that means you do not do R Cub over 3 that's not the case here x is your only variable are you are you with me on that that's the variable so what you do you you don't pull that out NE you can't pull that out that would mean that you you'd be multiplying right you're not multiplying by that X you're not so that's why I said you have options here you either separate this into two integrals you could do and put a big old bracket around it because you're multiplying by pi that's one way you could do it or you just consider it this way and this is the way you guys L me down so I'll do it this way you have the pi you're multiplying by this integral what's the integral of R 2 well think of it like a constant if that was a three what you'd get over here would be 3x wouldn't you I hope so integral of three would be 3x if that was a one you would get X true this is not a three it's not a one but it's a r 2 we treat that like a constant so you're going to get R 2 x it's a constant integral of a constant you just add an x to the back end of it think about it what's the derivative with respect to x r s so that works that works remember we're just anti- derivating here differentiating whatever that is minus now this one that is a function of X it's tied to the DX so go ahead and do that you're going to get X Cub 3 and we're going to evaluate from R to R now I'm going to move over here for this one but are you okay with that so far yeah yes no people can't hear you yeah okay are there any questions on that one so far so you can take an integral of this R 2 x integral of that super easy now let's just plug it in where do I plug in my RS to my RS or to my x's clearly my x's that's my variable I'm dealing with so quickly we're going to have Pi we're going to have R 2 * r - RB over 3 minus don't forget with the minus you got to plug in the negative R r^ 2 * r - R Cub over 3 are you okay on where all those things are coming from we got our R 2 R here and then R Cub over 3 no problem then subtract the Whole Thing r^ 2 Rus R Cub over 3 now be very careful with the signs don't lose anything don't mess anything up that's the real key with these definite integrals I got negative R cubed I got positive RB 3 because that's still going to be negative negative negative is plus don't forget any brackets yet not done RB - RB 3 + RB - R Cub over 3 2 R Cub - 2 R Cub over 3 yes no common denominator would make this well if you multiply by 3 over 3 you're going to get 6 rb/ 3 - 2 RB over 3 now they have a common denominator hey check it out what's 6 R Cub over 3us 2 R cub over three or what we know and love ha falling with the spirit Isn't that cool I love that one that's kind of fun so nice and precise and interesting that we were able to find it took us this long this long in calculus to be able to find the volume of the sphere isn't that neat but by slicing up and using little bitty circles spere how many people understood that feel okay with that good all right so we've already accomplished how to find the volumes of these solids which have been rotated around an axis we we said basically that if we rotate a solid around an axis the cross-section is going to be a circle if we add up all those circles in other words diss then we're going to get the volume of that figure does that make sense to you so to add up the surface area of all these discs this infinite number of discs you're going to get a volume out of it the idea of vol my washer stems from this problem what would happen say if I had my famous function called f ofx from A to B now here's where started okay this is what we were just talking about if you sweep this around the x-axis it will create a volume create a solid we'll be able to find the volume by taking slices of with our our discs that that's true however what happens if there's another function between F and the x-axis namely let's call it g of X what if I swept that thing around rotated about the x-axis it's also going to create some sort of a solid do you see it only the solid is going to have a hole in the middle this is actually the idea of a vase the other one that looked like a vase but it was a solid vase it' be like a vase out of concrete you couldn't put flowers in it this one would really have be a vase if I sweep this around it's going to be like taking this piece and Rota out there's going to be a hole in the middle kind of like a toilet paper roll almost like that but it's going to be a fancy shaped toilet paper roll I mean that'd be kind of cool but that's what it would similar that's what it would be like let's see if I can draw it for you so you get a threedimensional picture this might be hard for some of you to draw do you get the picture at least the idea of what I'm trying to portray here does it look can you see that that's the rotation if I rotate that out what it makes is some outer surface yes and then some inner surface where the the inside of that inner surface is actually Hollow let's think about what's going on here first thing that I want to talk about is the crosssection still a circle circular in nature sure still circular in nature if I take a cross-section bam but let's think about this for a second if I think about it well if it's circular in nature then then this should work for us the volume should still be some integral from A to B should be some integral from A to B how we did the volume of any solid is we integrated the surface area of our crosssection remember that we took the surface area of cross-section we integrated the surface area of our cross-section from A to B that was basically it so we still have this idea integrate from A to B the function a of X DX where a ofx is the area of the crosssection that seems pretty easy now all we got to do is find out how much is the area of the crosssection well let's think about it for a second a the cross-section well that should be think about think about the crosssection here what's the bigger disc you see the two discs that we're going to get out of this we're getting a disc made by F ofx and inside we're getting a dis made by G ofx what's the Bigg one so what if we did this what if we took the area of the cross-section of F ofx and subtracted the area of the cross-section of GX would you agree that that's going to give us the surface area the cross-section of the the piece that's actually filled in I I'll try to explain it with the picture again the area of f ofx remember that this is F ofx this outside one and this is G of X this inside one so if I take the area of the cross-section of FX and I take the area of the cross-section at G of X and I subtract them basically what I'm taking is a big disc from F ofx minus a small disc from G ofx and it's going to give me the region that the difference between those those circles basically and that's going to be the area between f ofx and g of X we if you understand that you okay with it okay cool well let's think what that means then oh how do you find area of a circle Pi r s p r 2 so if area is PK r s for a circle can you tell me what our R is here the r is for my f ofx my outside one okay I'll give you it's going to be y it's going to be Y at the value X wherever X happens to be what is y wherever X happens to be FX remember FX is the function right so how do you find out the height right at this point ah well you just take your function the function's value at that point remember F ofx says the function's height at the point x you with me on that so wherever I'm at I'm given the height by just plugging in X to F ofx that will be the function f ofx so the height here is f ofx that means the radius is f ofx what's the height here so here's basically all we said I'm going to try to recap this for you so you understand where the form is coming from we take this figure that's created by F ofx minus G of X that that that's basically the area we're going to sweep that area around the X AIS it's going to create some sort of a toilet paper rule uh that that's the idea a fancy one because it's not uniform in shape it's not rectangular but that's the idea here so we we sweep that out we have this volume it's solid but it has a hole in the middle of it what we're thinking is if we can find the cross-sectional area then we can integrate if we can find the cross-sectional area we can integrate across our notice how we still have perpendicular sides perpendicular to the x-axis we needed that remember for the discs you need to be able to get actual discs so we had to have those that work still so this is still true we're integrating all those discs adding them all up adding them up from A to B of the function a a ofx that's all the surface areas of those discs no problem whatsoever you just got to find the surface area of the disc the surface area of the disc of the I should say washer in this case because we're going to make that transition of the washer is the F ofx Circle minus the G ofx Circle that's that's what we're talking about here the area of the F ofx minus the area of the G ofx well we know areas pi r squ our R in any case of these cross-sections is f ofx or G ofx respectively so radius of our circle of our cross-section that's just the height of the function let write F ofx it's just the height of the function it just says G of X so if we put put in these areas we should get p r 2us pi r squ hopefully you're seeing where these things are coming from I'd love for you to understand why these formulas actually work what are we what are we really doing what's this stand for no this whole thing oh the area for the first function good whatever the outside one is the top we'll say the top one in this case the top one that's the radius the height of the function is the radius square it times it by pi you get an area this is the the inside second inside whatever you want to call it the G of X in this case radius square * pi that's the area area of the large disc minus area of the small disc gives us the area of a washer the surface area of a washer uh if we want to be a little bit fancier about this we'll probably just factor out the pie just back to the pie out and what that says is we actually have the expression for a ofx that we're looking for we're going to do the volume is an integral from A to B Sure Pi is going to be there we're just going to integrate the surface area of a washer from A to B that way right there is called the volume by washers that's what we just found would you like to do an exam okay I was hoping so otherwise the lesson to stall out be like okay so what do we do now party time not so much should e okay that's very wordy but I wanted to make sure you understand exactly what we're doing this is what we're doing we're trying to find the volume of the Sol that's created when the area between two functions f ofx and g ofx in this case between the interval on the interval 0 to two is rotated around the x-axis that's the whole idea now we should be able to set this thing up and find the volume of that um you're subtracting a few functions it Poss compose them can you like of mean likeus plug G of X it's not a composition no you can't do that sure you might be able to but it's not going to give us the volume that we're looking for okay now oh what's important for us to know before we start this problem top say it again which one's on top why would that be important if you subtract them incorrectly you are not going to get the right answer you're going to get some sort of negative can things have a negative volume no that's crazy to think about but no you can't have negative volume well maybe the opposite of complete vacuum I suppose that's not even black hole still has something in fact it has a lot of mass actually the center of black holes so no we can't have negative volume uh what we could have is positive volume but we need to make sure we set it uppr right in order to get positive volume so it says you need to find the one on the top you need to find the one on the bottom that way when you do subtract them the S said correctly when you subtract them correctly you get the right answer we need to know which one of these is our F ofx and which one is our G of X that we said a problem right so how would you do that not quite because I'm already giving you the you make it harder than it is if you set them equal to each other you're if you set them equal to each other you're going to find the places where they intersect if they do intersect these don't intersect I don't think they intersect someone do the math real quick in your head I believe they don't uh but X2 + 1/2 that goes like this x goes like this they're not going to intersect okay so even if you set them equal to each other you get x2 how they do- X don't know I don't really care but no that's not the way do they M CU you have one F right there X is let's see I got to see I got to see no they do not intersect discriminant tells us that you get b^2 - 4 a c that's negative true so b^ s - 4 a c is negative that means you do not have a solution for a quadratic formula which means these things can cannot except intersect in real numbers therefore no these don't intersect shame on you people for saying yes not a shame it doesn't really matter uh but no they don't your se but that's what that would be T doing for you so if you set them equal to each other you're going about it the wrong way that's too much work for this problem again you'd be making it harder than it needs to be this is not hard to set this thing up all you need to do is figure out what's on top for the given interval how do you figure what's on top for the ah I gave you the interval if I didn't give you the interval that's when you would set them equal that's when you solve to see where they intersect you get me on that so what do you do here plug the number yeah one's always going to be on the top of each another one that you might check by by seeing if they do intersect send them equal to each other do they cross over that's what that would do for that interval here I'm just telling you I told you already this one is going to be one function this one's going to be another one one's already going to be on top of the other for the entire segment so between zero and two One's On Top otherwise I would have worded it a little bit differently so if one's always on the top plug in a number what number you gonna plug in one I picked something in the middle of it one I don't doesn't really matter but plug in one if you plug in one here you're going to get one and a half you plug in one here you're going to get which one's higher so this is going to be higher than this one right it's always on the top I drew the picture for you but that allows you to set up even without a picture can you tell me where we start on this where whatever we going to have in here good Pi then a big old bracket because we're going to have a couple functions being squared in there and that that Pi we can even pull that out of our integral if you'd like to it's a constant it can do that what goes in the inside first tell me tell me first okay good what are you going to do with that function then what are you going to do uhhuh subtract what now now I'm going to put it in a bracket just so you see that this is the second function so notation wise I want to want to be consistent let's see if we can get it we've got our our formula here which says you have the pot no problem that's going to give us the well that's basically our formula from area to Circle we have the outer disc minus the inner disc but we got to square them because they're the radius squared how many people feel okay sitting that problem did you feel com this side do you guys feel all right with that you feel comfortable getting that this one was on the top of our G ofx this one's first this one's second now what probably go for it see if you can pH that out so fing all that out if you doing your head great if you want to write off the side great just get the right get the right answer make sure you fold it correctly uh this is going to be 1/4 plus X2 + x 4 and then you have this - x^2 I would like to know if you got the same thing on your paper that I got my paper did you get the same thing yes no good okay good what happens here cancel each other out which is kind of nice see the thing about it you could do this to two different ways if you really thought about it you could find out the volume of F ofx and find the volume of G of X and just subtract them couldn't you which that's another way to derive this formula by the way it's the same exact thing you'd have the same balance right put them together it'd be subtracting integrals between the same bounds with the common Pi you'd Factor the pi same thing you could do it however you're creating more work because when you do an integral of f ofx or the area of F ofx and do the integral of the area of G ofx you're doing two different integrals and doing all the bounds when sometimes you get this situation where you can combine like terms sometimes things go away so it's nice to do this rather than two separate integrals do one larger integral you seeing the point on that that's why I give it to you this way so X s's gone love that what do you say we pull that Pi out we got 0 to 2 1/4 + x 4th DX the pi is going to stay there can you take your integral of 1/4 + x 4th what are we going to get say what now X okay X over 4 that's great 1/4 x doesn't really matter it does need to be in parenthesis though has to have a bracket plus what and we'll be evaluating that from 0 to two so I'll have my Pi out there I'm going to do 2 over 4 plus 2 5 over 5 and then I'll subtract but when you plug in zero you're going to get zero so I'm just going to show it this way just to make sure I don't have anything wacky going on with that zero make sure I have it up there that's going to be our our volume when we multiply by five so 12 plus 32 over 5 69 how much 69 okay I think you catch do that for you but 69 Pi don't forget the pi 69 Pi 10 what did we just find it's kind of cool we actually find the volume of Some solid whatever it was as long as you know the function on the top and the bottom Some solid revolve around the x-axis that we found out how much if you were going to pour this out of concrete how much concrete you'd need 69 pi over 10 yards or feet or whatever cubic feet cont that order right yes hello I need a 69 pi over 10 yards of concrete H unless you know calculat like you got it son I got that you got see see contractors might know how to do that be the greatest concrete contractor ever how many people understood this example feel okay about it now can you do this when we revolve around the Y we've been going around the X the whole time can you do it this way probably I hope so the ideas aren't going to change just says what happens if you have a figure going up and down rather than left and right and the formulas will be very similar the only difference will be well of course the variables will be slightly different yeah so let's talk about volumes that are perpendicular where the I'm sorry where the planes of the interval are perpendicular to the Y axis so volumes where the crosssection is perpendicular to the Y AIS before we had the cross-section perpendicular to the x-axis that's why we're able to take and make all those little discs out of it here we got this way well if we if we talk about it the diss method then would end up looking like this instead of from A to B we usually use from C to D for the y- AIS so we go from C to D we'd have some area function but the area function is still going to be a circle Pi r^ squ Dy where U of Y would be your function in terms of Y not in terms of X where U of Y would be your function in terms of Y hence the Y instead of X that's the idea for the discs for the washers very very similar still from C to D still a Pi still the radius squar some outside function minus an inside function squ hopefully it looks familiar to you it's basically the same exact idea only you're going to the Y AIS to the X I'd like to give you an example if you don't mind on this would you like to see one sure now the process won't be any different it really won't just have different variables but this stems from from this idea what if you were to take by the way I only know how to draw one function like this so that's why I do the same one over and over I took it and went that way basically this is U of Y then the solid would look like this well it's not in proportion but hopefully you the idea we're just going this way with it taking this solid Rota around the y- AIS we'll get that sort of shape notice how we're perpendicular to the Y all the cross-sections will be perpendicular to Y that means we can integrate from instead of a to B we usually call it again C to D we can still integrate from C to d add up all those cross-sections basically let's try it let's do I'd like to give you several examples on this so I don't know if we'll finish this today but I do want you to see a lot of them uh so you get kind of the handle on it so we'll start kind of nice and easy work a way up from there so let's let's say this y = x is revolved around the Y AIS and it's bound by Y = 2 and Y = 0 what I'd like you to do is find the volume now you can draw a picture of this but you don't need to I want to draw the picture so you see what's going on on but you don't need to draw the picture you just need to understand what all these pieces mean okay here's the idea there's x s you with me now bound between 0 sorry bound between y = 0 and y = 2 what is yal 0 and what is yal 2 hor they are yeah in this context they're horizontal lines y remember y equal a constant equal a horizontal line yeah so what this says is when you go up to two it's bound by this and it's bound by this this is Y = 2 and Y = 0 so essentially I'm not worrying about this piece of the graph I'm just worrying about this piece now here's the problem am I going this way or this way it says around the Y so I'm I'm basically taking this shape and making this out of it making that shape out of it do you think the volume will be different if I go this way versus this way that's an interesting question why don't you figure that out later see if it is right now that's not our question the question is can you take this go this way and uh between those basically lines and find the volume of it question when you um we're taking it with respect to Y we want to Fig out volumes the same and we turn it with respect to X our BS change as well if you turn it this way yeah I don't even have any bounds you said Bound by two y y right you have to respect this way okay I see what you're saying so like that right there yeah okay yeah you could do that but I'm not asking with respect to x i I'll give you the the long story short no the volumes not going to be the same one's going to be completely different than one if you take this and roll out this way or this way you're going to have different volumes significantly different volumes okay it's not going to work the exact same way could you do it revolve around X yes but that's not what I'm asking for I'm asking for can you revolve it around the Y it'll give you a completely different looking shape even this if you revolve it this way it's going give you kind of like a bullet point right this gives you some sort of a weird looking cone thing that's the technical term for it at least weird looking cone thing so you have you have this shape almost like a flower coming out at you that's what that's going to be now here's the issue I'll give you a little note as well when you're revolving things around the Y AIS you need to have them in terms of Y which means you need to solve for x don't let that confuse you I'll say it one more time when you're revolving around the Y AIS it's got to be x = y y y y y y y does that make sense when you revolved around the x- axis you had y equal something in terms of X that's what we did I eras the problem but that's what we did over here you had all X's didn't you f of x g of X there're in terms of X that's because we're going around the x- axis and our bounds are in terms of X what are our bounds in terms of here why that you better have y to work with then so the note for you when revolving around the x axis functions must be in terms of X that means solved for y when revolving around the x- axis put functions in terms of X cuz your bounds are in terms of X you have planes that are perpendicular to the X it's all about the X solve for what when revolving around the y axis it's backwards put everything in terms of Y your functions needs to be in terms of Y your bounds are in terms of Y your planes are perpendicular to the Y in terms of Y solve for x that's the idea notice that we're revolving around the Y you're using this thing you really are you're going from C to d u of Y that's why I put U of Y over here guys so that You' see it has to be in terms of Y not X you're going around the y axis got in terms of y d y so for us let's see about our function if y = < TK X is this in the right in the right form to go around the Y AIS this would be around the xaxis perfect oh my gosh it' be awesome for the x-axis in fact if you want to right now you can probably figure well you have to do a little bit work for bounds because your bounds would change I do a little bit of work for that you'd have the square root of two kind of awful no you have to you have four that wouldn't be so bad so you could do that and figure out that the volumes are not the same uh but that's not good enough for going around the Y how do you make it go around the Y get xal y get x equals very good and you get that by square on both sides sure we're going to get if you square both sides X = y^2 what's the function that we're talking about X or y^2 M look what this does this says no no no I don't want the sare RO of X anymore we'll consider it y^2 from here to here just that little piece though just that little piece so we'll have let's see if we can do our our integral where are we starting ladies and gentlemen zero somebody else where are we ending what function goes on the inside oh you know what I forgot a couple key parts of course we want to fill that out right I get so excited just doing this got this we do mean this of course we got to have a pi what else are we going to have in there what do I put in for my my function what's my function and then what squ mm so these are in terms of y yal 0 Y 2 that's not a problem we put this one in terms of y That's our y s we fill out our our formula that we got now why do we have discs and not a washroom yeah we only have one function there's nothing between that so we can use the dis method just fine there's not another function to take away volume from it can you do that integral that's actually pretty basic let's go ahead and do that we'll get PI from 0 to 2 y 4 Dy that's Pi y the 5th over 5 because we know how to do integrals real well from 0 to two Pi will do 2 5th over 5- 0 what we're going to end up getting is 32 pi over five if I show a hands how many of you will feel okay with that so far would you like to see if the volume is the same go another way if you want to it's not hard I mean why don't you try on your own what that'd be a good practice for you right now set up if I switch this to going around the X and leaving the bals the same nope got to figure out the balance do that way don't just give up on it come on try something try something this part should be pretty easy right if we're going around the x axis we got the pi we got the r that's our function squ X and we got the square orig have you set up just like that that way yes guys over here too okay the problem is our balance how do we find our bounds up if we have y if we have y's right now how do you figure out plug plug them into x what are you plugging them into if y equals the sare root of x and you know Y is 2 and Y is z can you figure out X's that's doesn't this look similar to a u substitution when you're changing balance yeah very similar idea so this says plug in 2 for Y 2 = x 0 = x square both sides x = 4 and x = 0 you follow me on that so now we'll have an integral from 0 to 4 this is going to be a pretty easy integral it's going to be Pi 0 to 4 of X DX s < TK of X2 is X that's kind of awesome that's great then we'll have Pi x^2 over 2 from 0 to 4 Pi 4^ 2 2 - 0 equals same way different yeah quite quite a bit different actually not quite a bit different I guess it's off by just 1 30 second U but anyway one one that's huge P 32 it's off by P 32 huge difference huge but it well is different not the same so now that you see that I'm satisfied hope you understood both these examples is the calculus hard no really you know integrals right you know them and they have to give you nice ones to be able to do them so they're they're nice uh just remembering how to do it how to set it up and being prepared don't worry we have time still uh being prepared that you need to know what variable you have to have the function in terms of all right I I get to forewarn you here in the next section I'm going to give you a different way to find volumes it's going to be volumes by cylindrical shell and in that case your variables can of switch if you're going around the Y you want in terms of X and if you're going around the X you want in terms of Y that switches so be careful on on these two me on these methods if you're doing discs and washers your axes match up around the x- axis in terms of X around the y axis in terms of Y for the next method it will switch around the Y in terms of X around the X in terms of Y so get really comfortable with this that way you don't forget about it you got me now we'll stop there today we'll talk talk about a few more examples next time all right so we're in the practice stage of whatever section Ron 5.2 I believe we're in the practice stage and just doing some examples so the questions are normally worded something like this find the volume of the solid that's contained between a couple lines they'll give you boundaries or not contained between these two functions and revolved around they got to tell you which axis we're going about so basically this says find the area that's between there and revolve it around the x-axis that's going to make some sort of a solid that's going to have some sort of a volume do you find you with me on that now just as refresher if we are revolving around the x axis note that your equation should be so solved for y they should be X in terms of X so y equals and then a whole bunch of x's that's what solve for y or in terms of x mean so around the X must be dealing with x's you got it around the Y must be dealing with y's so my question is if we're going around the X are these okay absolutely okay yes we're going around the X they are in terms of x in terms of X means solve for y and these are solved for y so this is in terms of X and in terms of X which says it's all the terms have x's in terms of X the terms are based on X you get it so those are perfect for us now the problem is do I give you any bounds right here do you know which one's on the top right now do you know which one's on the bottom right now so those are things we're probably going to need to figure out in order for us to set up our integral remember that the volume the volume is I think I gave this to you last time a to B Pi fx^ 2us g ofx 2 DX did I not give that to you but this implied that F ofx was the top function G ofx was the bottom function so we need to find those things out we also need to know well it says the the volume uh in which the area contained by contained by we need know where to start and stop so where the area starts and stops according to the Y or the X in this case because with x's that's right according to the x axis now your headphon you're okay with the the idea of this so far so how do we find out this goes back to our area problem very similar idea how do we find out where these things are contained where the area is contained say it again that's exactly what we would do to find the area between two curves right well hey all we're doing now is finding the area between look at that the area between two curves and then taking the circles when we rotate them around that's all we're doing here so this really says take the area between the two curves and revolve it around that's what we're doing so what we need to do first is exactly what you said let's set these things equal to each other figure out which one's on the top so what we want to find is the intercepts where they intersect where they intersect by they I mean the functions and also which one is on the top okay so let's find out where they do intersect if we set them equal to each other this is kind of nice because it's already Sol for y basically we have y = x^2 and Y = X Cub set of them equal to each other gives us X Cub = x^2 still okay with that so far solving that well we get what what would you do to solve that probably because you're going to be using some sort of factor X Cub - X2 = 0 now what if x^2 * X - 1 = 0 can you solve for my x's please Z perfect not so bad in fact it's very similar to what you did for finding an area because that's exact the same idea that we're doing only revolving around some sort of an axis now do you know where your integral is going to start and stop that's pretty great so we can already start filling this thing out the volume is going to be from0 to one not a problem that's where these functions intersect therefore the area must be contained between those two things okay they got to be between there somewhere now what we need to do is find out which of these functions is on the top for the interval and which of these functions on the bottom for that interval how do you do that remember doing this remember doing that I gave you the graphic organizer I said plug a number in there plug it into X cub and x2 in this case figure out which one's on the top and which one's on the bottom what number are you going to plug in between zero and one 1/2 be great .5 whatever something between there it doesn't really matter as long as it's not zero or one so plug in 1/2 to both of them this gives you 1/8 this gives you one4 which one's on top x s is a bigger number than I'm sorry 1/4 is a bigger number than 18 therefore X2 is on the top X Cub is on the bottom is this coming back you at all do you feel okay with our setup thus far well we already know where we're starting where we're stopping let's go ahead and figure out the rest of this thing the rest of our integral we already know what our f ofx is going to be in this case the top function and the bottom function is going to be in this case so let's continue what's the next thing I should write here ladies and gentlemen yeah they're all going to have a pi that's from the circular nature of revolving around an axis then we have a big parentheses what goes next just X squ now you don't have to use brackets you can use parentheses as well just make sure you have the right idea we take the top function we Square that's what it says take the top function Square it we have that take the bottom function Square it we have that top bottom now we're set we're ready to go you feel okay with doing all this so far not bad do you see how similar it is to find an area very very very similar can you do the integral sure what are you going to do first probably pull the pi out square this you're going to get X to 4th Square this you're going to get x to the perfect perfect now when we do the integral remember to actually do the integral what this means notice how I'm writing these these things I've seen some notation problems in some of your work uh notice that when I do the integral firstly I actually do it I do x to the 4th and I don't plug in numbers to X 4th I first need to go X the 5th over 5 of course also notice that when I do the integral I've stopped writing the integration I have the bracket sure but I've stopped writing the integral that's not appropriate if you take an integral you stop writing the integral - x to 7th 7 and this is how you show you're going to evaluate off to the right hand side between 0 and 1 also there's a few people who have forgotten that sometimes zero is a number you have to plug in is not going to give you zero in this case if you plug in zero yes you're getting zero no problem but if I had like an xus one and you plug in zero that's not going to give you zero so be very careful on that so let's go ahead and do the rest of this if we do hi plug in one here and one there you're going to get 1 15us 17th and just to make sure I'm not forgetting anything I'm going to check to plug in zero 0 over 5 I know that's zero 0 over 7 I know that's zero so I'm going to write the zero just to show that I've done it that I haven't forgotten about it you don't want to forget about that thing so basically we have 1/5 minus 17th do 1/ 15 - 17th for me please 2 35ths or in other words 12 35ths wait yeah should be 735th - 535th should give you 2 35ths it's all good you guys able to get 2 35ths 2 pi over 35 don't forget the pi and that's important right I want to leave that hanging that's going to really change the answer any questions on that one before we go to the the next one remember this is practice you you you know how to do all the stuff at this point we're just kind of practicing get get a real good feel for it are you ready for another one or do you have any questions okay let's switch something up a bit and talk about a different type of problem uh maybe not around the x- axis maybe we go around the Y AIS so the same idea I'm not going to write the whole thing out area contained by y = x^2 x = y sared that should be fun around y AIS now could you please tell me something would you please tell me that if I'm revolving around the Y AIS what's what must my functions be in terms of so solved for X solve for x means in terms of y means your terms are y's that would be solve for x so in our case which one is okay for revolving around the Y AIS is this one okay for revolving around the Y is this one that's perfect this is what we want for revolving around the Y for the method of discs and washers that's what we want this one not so much if we're revolving around the Y change it how are you going to change it y very good now I think we're neglecting something here really when you take a square root you should have a plus and minus right however this function is only going to intersect the positive version of that if you if you think about that you have well I could draw it I suppose y = x^2 you have X = y^2 that's the only intersection that's happening so we're going to neglect the negative version of that xal y^2 just because it wouldn't intersect anyway do you follow me on that and you could show it by actually setting it equal but you're not going to get a real solution out of it it's not going to happen or you get some false solution so are you okay solving for x in this case take a square root plus and minus yes but the the positive the negative really isn't going to affect us in any way before so we're going to ignore it for us now what do we need to know after that to set remember our our whole goal is to try to set this thing up what's on top we need to balance remember terms of Y so everything's got me terms of Y nice and neat someone said bounds how do you find bounds now check it out do you see why you need this in terms of Y if I set the the functions in terms of y equal to each other I will be solving for y's right and this is along around the Y AIS it would be useless to solve for X's if I'm going around the Y AIS that wouldn't make any sense that's way I have in terms of Y all right well set them equal to each other I know X = Y I know X = y^2 therefore if x = aunk of Y and X = y^2 that means < TK of Y = y^2 so far so good solve for y how would you do that H not yet without just by looking at it how both sides Square both sides might be the best way to go how do you get rid of a square root square not square root a square root but Square it if I Square both sides it's legal to do you can do pretty much theary anything you want to to an equation almost anything you want to to an equation as long as you do to both sides which means that even if even Joe if you had change it to a 1/2 power to get rid of the 1/2 you'd still multiply by two correct that would be essentially the same exact thing as squaring it so Square both sides notice you're going to get y = now say what you said Alan what do you do next bring there you go 0al y 4us y now what would you do sure we we can Factor as much as needed here y = ybus 1 now when you do this problem you're going to get y = 0 and Y Cub - 1 equal 0 Can You Solve for y yes yes you can add one and take a cube root and you're going to get still one the only way this is working is if yal 1 that's the only way that happens with Cube not negative 1 because it's not a square it's a cube so the only way you're getting one from cubing a number is with positive one negative 1 cubed is negative 1 that's the only thing that that would work if you want to show it explicitly you'd have y = the cube root of one and that is one but I show of hands how many people feel okay getting that far yes yes it is just some algebra but it's kind of nice to review that so you don't get stuck on the algebra when you're trying to do calculus that's the biggest problem of calculus hey do we know where our integral starts and stops where along the y or the X very good because this is in terms of Y we solve for y so already we know that V equals 0 to 1 in terms of Y now H the idea which one's on top changes when I'm talking about the Y on top doesn't mean this way anymore on top means this way right now do you get that so really we're asking which one is on the right and which one is on the left you still do the same way though you still I mean basically you don't even have to draw a picture or think of it you just have to plug in a number and figure out which one's bigger that goes first which one's smaller that goes second that still works only bigger this time means right smaller means left and then you'll be revolving that now your head you're okay with that I know we're talking lots of theory here not lots of theory but it's it's abstract because I can't draw a lot of the stuff very well so how do you do it same thing we just did here same thing 0 and one we'll take a number and we're going to plug it in to right here what number are we are we thinking about you could do 0.5 I might do uh 1/4 because I can take a square root of it very easily and I'm going to have to take a square root do you understand maybe take 1/4 so if I plug in4 just do it to both this gives you a half this gives you 116th and we can clearly see which one is bigger and which one is smaller by using some numbers that we actually understand so which one is a bigger one so thenare root of Y goes on the top nice graphic orer huh tells you which one exactly goes where which one is on the bottom now of course bottom means left top means right but you set it up the same the same way same way so which one in other words is going to come first the square Ro of Y or Y squ okay fill out the inter for me so what am I going to have Okay C get the pi square root of Y I heard squared very good and then yeah don't make the mistake putting a plus right we're actually subtracting volumes here subtracting uh I'm sorry surface area and then revolving that so I'll make that bracket what's the next one I heard you I'm going to write it this way feel comfortable sitting up the integral notice really the setup and the plugin in numbers is the hard part here hard part the integrals most of them are going to be very doable for you because otherwise we get stuck you know maybe I'll pull that Pi out of here we got a constant anyway we may as well pull that out square root of y^ s that's kind of nice I just get y minus this is going to give you y 4 Dy not such a bad integral to do after all we get a pi we're going to get y^2 / 2us y 5 over 5 and we're evaluating from 0 let's plug in the one first that's what it says to do so we're going to do 1^ 2 over 2 that's just 12 - 1 5 over 5 that's just 1/5 I'll check the zero but I know I'm getting 0 - 0 that's still Zero 12 - 1/5 should be three bam not too bad not too bad as long as you understand the idea here that find out what they they actually intersect set up the integral appropriately make sure you find out which one comes first which one comes second and then it's all about the formula just plugging it in by a show of hands how many people feel okay with what we've talked about so far now I'm going to give you one more uh I would consider this to be kind of a tougher problem but it's going to take us a little while for me to explain it to you but I want you to see it I don't think I've given you any homework on it I might I don't think that I have I don't think I changed the assignment but I will certainly give you something to do with this so see if you can comprehend the idea here what if I ask you to find the volume of the solid contained by this and that is revolved around y equals 3es that's interesting question it says right now we're not going around an axis right now it says imagine this you have some sort of an area right and instead of revolving around a y AIS or an x- axis you're saying pick some line revolve it around that can you still do it answer is yeah we can as long as you understand what the concept is that we're doing here now I'm going to draw the picture of what this is what this is you don't necessarily need the picture to do it uh you can do it the way I showed you as long as you understand what's going on so I'm going to illustrate it so you do understand the way it's going on first thing I want you to get picture of is what taking place now that's a pretty easy function that just says y = x yeah and this one says y = x Cub which looks essentially like this for this interval and if you really want to find out where they intersect where where could you do it or how could you do it okay so if I set them equal I would get x = x Cub I would get 0 = x Cub - x I would get 0 = x^2 - 1 for the sake of sorry for the sake of keeping it easy I'm just just going to focus on the positive here we're going to get 0 1 and 1 I'm going to just so you make a note of this I'm going to ignore this one to keep it easy for us also you can think back to odd and even functions if I were to Revol well no that's not true because we revolving around something that's not XA disregard that statement to keep it easy I'm going to keep between zero and one just so we make it easy on ourselves you can do another you you could also do this with the negative portion of this but it would be a different integral you'd have to do two different ones no that won't any of the volume area of course it will if I remember that this is going to this would also do this right I'm saying let's just to find out what this is going to be let's forget about this for a second because you'd have to do a different integral anyway you have to set a completely different integral anyway cuz they cross over one's not onp top of the other one the whole way so you have to do it a different one anyway let's just focus on this one for right now and see how to do the problem in the first place do you understand what I'm trying to do here so all I'm really saying is this is zero and this is one that's what I'm saying now so we see the area what are we going around this no this are we going around this no what is yal 3 house that is it a oh come on you should know is it this way or this way it's this way y = 3 y a constant just gives you a horizontal line Y = 5 would be at 5 Y = 2 would be at 2 y 3 over2 would be at one and a half so if this is one which it is one one what we're talking about is can you revolve this figure around that treating that like the axis now that's a really interesting question isn't it it's kind of kind of crazy can you can you do it well we're going to think through it as to how in the world we might do this and it's going to stem from this formula but we're going to change it just a little bit by the way questions on that I asked you that though already I think oh yeah this way so we're ring around that one now let's think of what what actually is going on here um what does this represent in our formula the top sure but what is this well let me let me I'll kind of split it apart for you again A to B Pi FX 2 yeah minus G of X2 DX you know before I go further I better make this clear also what should our variables be in terms of x's or y's xes because we're really going this way around that it's almost like an x- axis that's been moved up a little bit do you get why we're in terms of X and not y if it was this way yes why basically goes uh where is the where are the planes perpendicular to that you're going to find the area of and then consequently the volume they're perpendicular to the xaxis still so they're they have to be this way in terms of X well what does it mean when I do this what what are those things what do those look like C they're circles so what is f ofx say it again it's a radius what is g of x a radius now that worked very well because F ofx can be considered a radius if you're going from the X axxis can't it this would be the radius of that figure being R and this would be the radius however I'm not going around this now I'm going around this so if we can find out the area of those cross-sections remember doing the cross-sections by washers if we can find out the area of those cross sections incorporating this y = 3 we should be able to do very similar thing let's think about it if I'm to revolve so this is FX is basically your radius if I'm going to revolve this thing around the three halves can you tell me what the r it's going to be so hard for me to draw I don't know if I can do it um I'll try for it's hurting my head too many circular shapes there's so many there's so many going on but it almost looks like an eyeball eyeball but that's flat this is flat the end this is flat the end uh and there's this little space that goes around you see the space that goes around that oh you know what this would make it a little clearer um this right here there we have that space that's going around that what we want to figure out is like a sideway B kind of like that yeah very much with the open bottom and open top if this is y = 3 here was basically the idea for going around the axis look find the radius square it times it by pi find the other radius inside radius square it times it by pi and then subtract them that's the surface area of the outside one minus the surface area of the inside one and then we integrate the surface area that was the idea do you get the idea well now this is very similar let's just think the outside one is or what the inside one is when when you go back to here what function is this steming from look at the function execute what function is this one stemming from okay would you agree that the outside function is X cubed yes and the inside function is X yes let's find a radius that's based on three halves how would I find out the distance oh this thing for a second at any random point x okay how would I find the between a constant line 3 let's say right here 3 and this is what I'm looking for how far is that say it again it'd have to start with three halves wouldn't it because three halves a little bit higher have to start with the three Hales CU that's here three halves and then you said minus minus what ah would you agree that at any point the height of this function is X cu therefore at any point the distance between here and here is 3es are constant minus X cubed and that's exactly right can you do the same thing for a random point from here to here how much is that 3 Hal it's where we start that's our constant minus X that the height of the function at X so right here says this whole thing from here to the xais is 3es the thing from here to here is X so if I take 3 minus X I will find the radius now that's kind of hard for some people to grasp do you grasp it how people do it feel okay with that now is that for the entire thing like if you were to do above radius is the radius right so we use the fact that this is apart from the xaxis to figure out the radius whether or not this is above or below that's the same distance it's still 3- did you get that you sure so radius is radius doesn't matter how you get it that's the radius now we're going to go ahead and fill this out this out actually using this idea this was the radius that's why I had I walked you through this this was the radius this is the radius correct so for us when we have a y equals a constant line and we're going around that that actual axis it's going to augment this just a little bit it says well really what we'd have is the y equals a constant minus the in this case it's the outside function not the top function the outside function that's weird to think about outside function inside function outside inside now I don't know if they give you that form in the book or not I don't think that they actually do uh but they expect you to understand the idea that all you're doing is taking a sliver of it a slice a washer finding out the radius look at that the radius here and the radius here squaring them times them by pi and then subtracting them you find the surface area of the outside Circle minus the surface area of the inside Circle in this specific case why moving its point of Revolution Chang the area of this of the actual area wouldn't the area still be the same it's on x-axis it's just location space no think about how much further away you are this is actually touching the x-axis right okay and you're just going right around it this is sweeping out think about if you're this far away you're this far away out here too right but the inside part is not being swept out cuz the shape of the object hasn't changed this whole thing is being swept out though so if I do this it cover I go I'm going to take this little pan right here and I'm going to go like that how much space is it covered I don't know this much whatever that is uh 37 pi over4 no I'm just kidding awesome if I could do that then how much is this with the sound effect does it sweep out more volume or not because it covers more space of course it covers a lot more space it'd be easy if we could if we had could just do the same thing but it's not the same thing this goes all the way around something that's further away than the x- axxis right now yes that formula is it FX or oh you know but uh I just forgot this no no no no no what did I do to you guys goodness me no I was right I was right but and C get sare radius that was where my mistake radius squared and radius I just had too many little brackets sorry I got confused radius hopefully you understand the idea I just Jack it up for you good catch Scott radius squar and radius squared you got it this is the radius of the inside this is the radius of the outside you're squaring it subtracting them and Times by pi that is the surface area of the cross-section of the big one minus little one that's what we're talking about and then we'll integrate that let's try to fill this thing out where do you start take your integration where do you no where do you start sure it's still zero right still one zero two one what do you have [Music] inside now inside the pi you can put P outside that's fine it doesn't really matter inside inside there what's next what's our C in this case yeah so when you think about it's just 3 - XB squar sure square of course but that's saying the outside function that's the larger of the two radi the outside function minus inside function give me that M keep going yeah perfect I would love it if you would understand where this is coming from do you understand where it's coming from radius of the outside big one radius of the little one no problem this is the surface area after you subtracted those two things can you do the integral sure yeah sure we can what's the first step in doing the integral what would you do deal Roots firstc sare yeah probably Square them keeping our signs correct is crucial for you also I I'd like to encourage you to combine start combining like terms if you have them I don't know if you're going to have them here or not but if you do have them my goodness combine them U with before you start doing integral some of you guys are are doing integral you're setting up a problem and you have like five terms three of which can be combined you're doing the integral of all five terms why why I'm why why not combine your like terms before you do it saves you twice the work it saves you so much work okay I'm off my little so box now let's go ahead and figure the rest of this uh if I do this this is 94s minus top minus the bottom say what oh you know what it really is but you can't see it here it is the top minus the bottom all right but it's just a different axis you just have to set you have to set it this way yeah kind of reverse Think Outside Inside okay uh good question 9us 3 X Cub I believe plus x 6 very good that's the first one hope I don't run out of room here next one gives you 94s notice how it's still in parenthesis I'm not dealing with that yet I'm not doing in my head I'm making sure I have the signs right even I do this take your time and do the signs right- 3x plus X2 and I need a DX don't forget about your DX it says what you're integrating okay get double check on my work make sure that I've done that correctly yes yes yes can see that far 9/4 - 3xb + x 6 then minus in parentheses 9 4 - 3x + x^2 dist yeah you know what we are going to do that we're going to distribute negative we're going to look to see if we can combine anything after that we have 94s we have - 3x Cub + x 6 - 94 + 3x - x^2 DX I'm going to move over here do you have any questions on the picture that I drew firstly okay wow okay so Pi 0 to one oh that's nice I like zeros to on those are those are real cool what happens here simpy this is why you'd simplify before you do integral because otherwise you'd integrate 94s and you have 9/4 X twice and you're going to eventually get rid those numbers anyway why not get them now and and don't waste time integrating the other things you can't combine any of that I'm going to write in the appropriate order I'll write x to the 6 I see a - 3x Cub I see a - x^2 and a was it a plus 3x can you do the integral of course yeah it's actually not bad right it's the setup that's hard to understanding [Applause] that let's check your ending roll it with my integral to make sure we both did them right did you guys get it right as well same thing same same now we're going to plug in one first we'll plug in zero next if I plug in the one if I if I evaluate I'm going to get 17 I love 1's two man they're nice 34s 1/3 and 3 Hales I'm going to check the zero but notice how every term is going to go to zero so I'm going to write at the back end of this yeah I did check zero it's just going to be zero so far so good notice please stop for a second notice how if the zero had come first it would be zero minus all this stuff you follow making it all negative that would be the case for the other part of this the between negative 1 and zero you follow now if that went around three halves notice that that volume is going to be huge which is why I almost made the mistake of remember the odd function how you just double it that's not the case for volumes because you're taking something way lower way above that three Hales it's going to be much larger volume you'd have to do a completely different integral for that did you get it so we set up the same but it' be a different volume Al together so combine all those has anyone done 1 7us 34s 9 84 how much 89 17 - 34 - 13 okay Pi * 47 84s is 47 pi over 84 I got to be honest gotta be honest your Calculus guys know how to set this stuff up you're plugging numbers in that's so great make sure you plug the numbers in right that that's the biggest mistake I've seen on tests all the time 

Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 5.3:  Volume of Solids By Cylindrical Shells Method
okay the theory part of how to do cylindrical shells I briefly went over this last time it's not on the videotape so don't look for it uh but I briefly went over this last time here's our idea can we take this region that's Bound by our two vertical lines at A and B and F ofx revolve it around the Y AIS and get the volume of that Sol that's created and I just finished saying this we can use the the disc or washer method but notice how if you consider this in terms of Y that would have to be two different functions in terms of Y top bottom and then top bottom that's what you'd have to revolve around so that necessitate two completely different integrals and our question is is there a way that we can do this with only one integral and that's where the cylindrical shells method idea comes in says yeah you know what maybe we do maybe we just consider this to be a function of X revolved around so we have basically this idea hopefully you can see the image I'm trying to draw it's not that easy to draw the Swift Out volume of this this figure being revolved around the Y AIS we get kind of this I think it I called it a Jello mold last time looks like a Jello mold to me it's got that like cavity in there maybe it's upside down pineapple cake even have those oh my gosh so good but anyway that's that's the idea and we said what if we could take and instead of thinking of this as washers cuz it wouldn't work that well for us because again if you thought of this as washers you'd have one two different functions in terms of Y which is the axis upon which you are revolving you got me on that if you're going around y with discs and washers they had to be in terms of Y not X so that says in terms of y That's one function and that's another one in terms of Y that would be two different volumes here that we're talking about it'd be like this perfect cylinder volume and then the top little piece volume that's what you would have to do as if you were to use washers did you get the idea now if we talk about cylindrical shells it says this imagine you have this cake thing right this it has a hole in the middle and it has some some cake around it's perfect perfect circular shape and you take a coffee can and you go and and you you pull it out what you're going to get is a cylinder right the top of it's going to be a little bit not perfectly straight it's not going to look exactly like this it's going to have a little lip to it does the lip actually matter for us imagine the idea of limits what are we going to end up doing to the size of that cylinder the thickness is is of that cylinder is going to go very very very very very very small so we're going to take out these these basically cylindrical chunks of cake coffee C coffee can take it out you get this chunk of cake you got it go a little bit bigger you got another chunk of cake slightly bigger like concentric circles you get the picture bigger and you keep on slicing this cake up up with these larger and larger coffee cans now eventually we're going to say the coffee can is increasing infinitesimally small so they're they're all just little circles that are that have some sort of height to them barely any width at all that's the idea of the limit right taking that width to zero and then find the volume of each of those cylinders so the question comes down can you find the volume of a cylinder I don't know let's think about it we want to P go for each region find the volume would you agree that the volume is going to be the area of the cross-section times the height we've already done that several times if I took a cross-section that's going to give you some sort of surface area the big circle minus the little circle the area of the big circle minus the little circle gives you the area of the cross-section Times by height and we're going to get the volume of that particular cylinder not your have you're in agreement good because I'm right you should you should know that so we know that this is going to be the area of cross-section times height we got to find the area of cross-section what is the figure what's the shape of our cross-section cular it is circle yeah in fact every Circle and it's a washer it is it's a big circle and then a little circle and we'll subtract big circle minus little circle well every Circle has a radius every Circle has a radius let's call this one or doesn't really matter what we call them let's call this one R1 and this one R2 sorry if you can't see that it says R2 so radius one Radius 2 radius one would be the the radius of the larger Circle radius two would be the radius of the smaller Circle how do you find area of crosssection circle area of the circle area of the circle not just radius one minus Radius 2 that's going give us a difference in radi we want to find the area of the first radius minus the area of the radius so area of the cross-section then should be Pi Radius 1^ 2 minus Pi radius 2^ 2 times oh times the height and Joe said what's the height function the function absolutely you're right the height is the function look at this can you see that the height at each little piece is going to be the function's height now we're going a little bit uh Beyond where we're at we're just talking about cylinder right now the cylinder let's kind of imagine that it is flat the height is going to be the function's height wherever that would be you follow me on that now when we get to this point we're going have to pick the arbitrary point in between that's what we're going to do over here the arbitrary point then we'll find the height at the arbitrary point which won't matter because our our distance between point go to zero saying the arbitrary point it's fine so times the height well the height is the function at X so what that means you know what let's leave can I do this later I don't I want to be very accurate about it I don't want to give you f ofx can I just leave it h for now I'll work around it I I'll get you f ofx over here I want to give you H that way I can pick an arbitrary point and be actually really accurate so would you three that this is the volume think about it area of big circle minus area of a little circle that gives you the section or the sectional area cross section area times the height that's going to give you a volume don't you you're all right I'm going to do some fancy math with you ready for some fancy math yeah sure okay fancy first first math not fancy math we're going to factor out the pi no problem here comes the fancy math R1 2- R2 2 is a difference of squares you see it mean you can Factor it as different squares which means I can do that difference of squar says that if you don't believe me distribute it take this times this you will get that true statement now comes a real fancy math nothing's really hard but I'm trying to get this in terms of things that you're going to understand in a second uh what I'm going to do would you agree that if I multiply this expression by two and2 I really haven't changed the value multiply by two and I multiply by 1/2 2 * 1/2 gives you one so I'm going to be multiplying by one in a very special way here what I'm going to do is say I'm going to make it two I use black so you see the change here two PI 12 then all that stuff you agree that's the same thing same expression same value at least I want you to think of what we actually have here if I reorganize this just a little bit what do I want to do I want to do that just reorganized I move this here move the H here and put a bracket around the 1/2 times the the radius one one of plus we're not adding we're multiplying which one which difference of square oh sorry yes thank you good call Shane yeah I made that mistake anything else did you caught are we good pretty sure we're right I've just categor I've just organized these ones put a bracket around it move this here but I want you to think of what this this means H is the height sure what is R1 minus R2 that's the second one R1 minus R2 what's it represent over here the thickness that's exactly right the difference in the radi very good which would give you the thickness of the shell you follow me on that this is going to be the thickness of the shell what's 12 R1 + R2 what happens when you add two things together and multiply by 12 you get the average this is the average of the radi so the average of the radi this is the thickness of your shell so basically what I've got for you here this is what we want to make in general in terms of f of x and x we have 2 pi times the average radi or average radius I'm sorry times the height times the thickness would you wish feel okay getting that far on that this row yes you guys okay with it any questions on on how we got that little manipulation but it really comes out to average radius sure height and then we have our thickness what we're going to try to do now is match up parts in terms of F ofx and these things Joe question um cindal shell both of them are both of the since they're like two different shells in each other does that mean that the same function would just have different radiuses same function okay same function yeah you mean f ofx right right yeah this this this top part is flat right now because I'm trying to get you this idea over here and over here it's technically not flat it does have a little bit of a function to it right now what we're going to allow it to do is come really close to the function doesn't matter what we're concerned about right now is how to find average radius how to find the height the height is going to be given by the function so that's kind of nice and the thickness are you ready to start on on this one sure it's good question good question here's what we're going to do we're going to make a shell within this cylindrical shell one little cut we're going to make a cylindrical cut basically at oh let's talk about where it's at if this is X subk it has stand for a random shell right just some random cut x sub K if this is X subk okay what we're doing here basically think about this we're going to take this is going to be kind of a weird concept but but think about finding the area how we took little Cuts right we took all these little sections like this you with me where each of the thicknesses were Delta X true if I take those cuts and I revolve them also around the Y AIS you see how I'm going to get the shells I'm going to get those coffee can things I'm going to get the shells out of it so this is xub K this one's got to be xub kus1 it just stands for the previous cut what we're going to do is within this solid shell we're going to make another cut arbitrary Point how do we call our arbitrary points what do we label XK dot look I'm I'm trying to make this so you understand from the area idea this was like x sub 1 x sub 2 xub 3 x sub k whatever it was and we took an arbitrary cut in here XK dot remember that if we take an arbitary cut in there we're going to make a cut at XK dot but that Cut's going to go all the way around our figure there don't so not now don't so not now now here's the key to doing this appropriately for us we have to choose XK dot to be the midpoint of that interval you'll see why in a second so make a cut at at XK dot which is going to be the midpoint of our section can you tell me something in relation to x k x subk and x sub K minus one what's a midpoint it's say it again average we're going to use that in a second would you agree that if I put x k dot right in the middle of our section it's the average of those two numbers no matter what they are you follow me on this okay so this is this is basically average average okay only two more things we have to do what is the thickness what's the thickness from here to here it it's XK minus what say that would give you XK minus one very good yeah that's that's right by definition hey what what's the thickness of any cut come on now people think back think back what's the thickness of your cut Delta X or Delta X remember Delta X we took a thickness of our cut always Delta X the thickness of our cut here is Delta X and we're revolving that Delta X around Delta X by definition is x subk - x sub K minus one that's what it is so this is Delta X thickness is Delta X now we can actually talk about height I left it here as H for height but I want to talk about the height is at XA dot notice how I can't look I couldn't really I want to be accurate I couldn't really give you f ofx here because I can't tell you I can't tell you what the function is the height of the function is of this whole thing but as soon as I pick an arbitrary Point as soon as I pick that exact point can you tell me the height of that exact point yes that's the difference so as soon as I pick XK dot how much is our height X very good yeah height is f of xp. sweet love it you know what we're almost done almost done let's look at what we wanted to find and you said you understood this right at least you said hopefully you didn't lie to me 2 pi constant we going to have it average radius that's this okay do we have something that represents the average radius up here yeah in fact if you think about what the radi are they are XK and XK minus one the average of which must be XK dot the midpoint of that interval we chose it to be the midpoint for a reason so that we could come down here and say 2 pi is going to be there average radius x k dot yep that is the average radius times height height we now know that as soon as we pick that that arbitrary point which Happ has to be in the middle of it okay I guess it's not so arbitrary anymore as soon as we pick the midpoint of it we can find the height at that little cutting the little cutting within uh the like cylinder of C of of coffee cake sounds like coffee can cake whatever the that little cylinder of cake we can go right in the middle of that we can find the height of the function at that point did you follow me on that so the height is is f of XK do and the thickness well the thickness by definition is just the thickness of our cut the thickness of our cut revolved around the whole thing revolved around the y- axis the thickness of this piece then has to be Delta X that's not our formula that's our formula for for one individual shell of X subk that's one of them how do I find all of them then youate no not yet not a limit yet this is one of them how do I find more of them I add them all up yes this is one shell this is an approximation for all the shells approximation for all the shells how do I find the exact the exact volume as what good yeah it says basically take that coffee can and make up an Infinity number of them where they go out just a teeny little little bit what happens when you take a limit of a sum what do you get out of that that's what it is so we have volume is an integral from where wherever our integral starts our interval starts A to B 2 pi what happens XK dots when I when I take limits what do they become random arit random arbitrary points become actually just a representation for all X's X so F of XK dot becomes not not x f of x and what do Delta xes become this is called the method of shells also please note it's perfectly appropriate to do this around the other axis going Direction y but you're going to Note One Thing please W this is where people make just big mistakes try to make it real clear it's kind of like the punch line for us we got a few minutes left this kind of like the punch line okay when we did shells and washers the axis upon which you revolve like the x- axis is the terms in which your function must be so in order to go around the x- axis you had to have in terms of X Y axis in terms of Y look what happens here it switches this is around the Y AIS it's got to be in terms of X okay around the x axis would be in terms of Y look it we're revolving this around the Y it's still in terms of X we never switched variables so please make sure your notes are correct this is for I'm not making a mistake here this is counter this is what this is correctly okay I'm not making mistake I'm doing this deliberately this is around the Y AIS this one is around the Y the x- axis true St true story true story now did you understand it yeah I'd like to set one up for you just one you'll find out that they're they're not too hard to set up I I I want to make sure you see it before you go because it's all been Theory today and it hasn't been anything substantial well it's been very substantial but not anything concrete I want to give you a concrete before you go can you guys hang on for a minute man that was a lot of work a lot of work for find the volume of the region inclosed by y = theun x x = 1 x = 4 which are vertical lines revolved around the Y AIS first question I have for you since we're revolving around the Y AIS with this method cylindrical shells method is this okay or not around the Y AIS okay or not in terms of X means your terms are xes solve for one okay maybe this way around the Y solve for y around the X solve 4X okay in terms of X in terms of Y different so is this appropriate for round the Y with this cylindrical shells method would it be appropriate for for uh discs or washers no no it's different it's like backwards so be very careful on that now we'll set this up here's what this says to do the volume is integral from where do we start xal 1 that's line going for down 1 to 4 they're clapping for me we good what goes in inside come on help me out real quick Pi 2 pi look at what happens look what this says it says x no matter what you're going to have an X there so you just tack on an X then it says f of x what's f of x and then so this is the integral from 1 to 4 we'll pull out the 2 pi let's do that we have x * < TK X DX how do you do that integral x * X DX what would you do exponents yeah exactly so 2 pi x * x 12 power DX 2 pi hopefully you can do this in your head we have a one and a 1/2 that's going to be three is the integral really hard set up just set up 1 4 we've got 2 pi the integral would be X to 5 over 5 from 1 to 4 simplify a little bit you're going to have 2 piun * 2 x 5 over 5 here's probably how I would do this I would take the four pi over 5 out of it and I just worry about the X to 5s from 1 to four notice I'm taking the 4 over 5 with the pi and I'm just woring about that piece now do this makes it easier 4 Pi 5 I'm going to have 4 to the 5 - 1 to 5 no no fraction that that makes it nice when you do this now four the 5es I know how to do this pretty quick in my head I take a square root of four and I take the fifth power that's 32 I take 1 to 5S anything to one to anything is one so this is 31 hopefully I did that correctly < TK of 4 is 2 2 5 is 32 so you're going to have 4 FS 4 fths pi times 30 what I say plus 31 * 4 124 your volume is 124 pi over 5 without having to do sh uh washers or disc shells well we're continuing talking about how to do some volumes now we of course we've covered some disc method and washer method we're just getting into the cylindrical shells method which is the idea of I think I mentioned the cake and the coffee can right cutting slices of cake out and find the volume of each cylinder and then we're adding up all those cylinders so it was different than shells and washers because I'm sorry discs and washers because with discs and washers whatever axis you're revolving around that that's what the the functions need to be in terms of so around the x- axxis in terms of X around the y axis in terms of Y the cylindrical shells me it kind of flips that it says if we're going around the Y AIS that's when you want in terms of x if you're going around the x- axis that's when you want in terms of why are you foll me on that it's it's it's backwards almost like it's backwards so that gets confusing for a lot of people so let me ask you this in this question if we're going to revolve some region around the Y AIS are these formulas good the way they are or do we need to change those functions what do you think if we're going around the Y AIS it should be in terms of you need to understand what in terms of X means is this in terms of X this one's good either way by the way if you notice that that's that's fine uh is this one in terms of X yes this is in terms of X get it in your head that in terms of X means the terms should be X terms there are or solved for y so around y for syrial shells solved for y or in terms of x those mean the same thing they have to mean the same thing to you so again I asked this question if we're going around the y- axis which we are here is this okay yeah good now we remember that our formula for the volume was what I give you 2 pix F ofx DX only here well we got two functions so we're going to do something very similar to finding the area between two curves remember finding the area between two curves how you took the top curve minus the bottom curve we can do the same thing here same exact thing we'll take the top volume minus the bottom volume basically the top function will sweep out a bigger volume the bottom function will sweep out a smaller volume if we subtract those two volumes what it will give us is basically the volume between the top function and the x-axis minus the bottom function and the x-axis and that will give us the remaining volume between our two functions so it will look very very similar to area between two curves for us though that means well firstly how do I find a and b and secondly how do I figure out which one is on top how would I find a and b in this case what do you think set to each other okay let's do that let's do X = x^2 we can solve it and what we find is that x = 0 or xal 1 you okay with the zero or one yeah you know folks you okay with it so we just found our bounds of integration that's kind of nice we already have that set up so we're going from 0 to 1 very good does the 2 pi ever change for us so we're going to get a 2 pi does The X ever change for us the X this x the X going to be there no matter what it's always going to be there unless it's a Y unless we're going around the x axis and then that's a a y variable you follow me so the x is going to be there what we care about finding is the F ofx in this case now be careful but set it up just like you would the area between two curves so we're going to find the function of the top the function of the bottom and subtract them and I'll talk about that in just a second can you find the function on the top oh I hope so how would you do it cool so we got from 0 to 1 plug in2 if I plug in 1/2 to X I get 1/2 if I plug in2 to X2 I get 1/4 that tells you X is on the top and X2 is on the bottom raise your hand feel okay with that so far cool so when we plug this stuff in we go all right well F ofx it's not just one function anymore it's the top one minus the bottom one when you think about that I hope it makes sense to you just just think for a second think if I distributed this and I broke those integrals up what would have is the volume underneath this minus the volume underneath this or in other words the volume of the top one revolved around the Y minus the volume of the bottom one revolved around the Y that gives us the remaining volume you got it same very similar idea to area between two curves now let's go ahead and work on how to do that integral what's the first thing you would do go for it oh yeah i' probably pull out 2 pi as well so from 0 to one what else are you going to do definitely distribute don't try a substitution if you can do it easier than that so most of these aren't substitutions most of them are pretty basic just a little manipulation x^2 - x Cub DX that means we're going to get 2 piun I'll do it as X Cub over 3 - x 4 over 4 and we're going from 0 to 1 so that gives you 2 pi if we plug in the one you're going to get 1/3 minus 1/4 I'm going to test the zero just to make sure I don't miss anything but we're going to get zero in this case but you want to have it in mind that way in case you had like a minus one up here x - 1 Cub you wouldn't miss that fraction so that is going to be a zero so basically we have 2 pi * if you do that fraction I believe you get oh what is that how much you said 112 so we're going to get how much six five over six now of course I'm going through this a little bit quickly because you know how to do the integrals you know how to plug the numbers in do you feel okay with our example guys ever here yeah are you awake today so we get the on Mondays on Mondays today last we of school Mondays I know it right I know it so notice that even though we went around the Y AIS we didn't change our variables we had in terms of X this means in terms of X so for the cylindrical shell method around y DX not Dy it's got to be in terms of X on that one let's go ahead and try one where we're going around the x- axis just so you can see it one time I'll talk about one more we'll set it up but we won't do it and that'll be the end of this particular lesson so we want to find the volume Bound by volume B by xal negative what note the negative x = y^2 + 6 Y and X = 0 around the x- axis in our case for cylindrical shells since we're practicing that right now cylindrical shells looks like this oh wait hang on we're not going around the y- axis anymore we're going around the x axis if we're going around the xaxis for cylindrical shells method our function should be in terms of what okay are they in terms of Y yes y's and y's yeah that's great in terms of y means solve for X So Cal for cylindrical shells around the X solve for x or in terms of Y so for cylindrical shells you go from C to d 2 pi am I going to have an X here right now what am I going to have okay so make sure you make that change we'll call it g of Y Dy what's x equal Z this way that's actually the y- axis what that means is that we have a vertical line the y- axis that's no problem we're going to be taking just taking this function in terms of Y and going this way with it now since those are our two functions the second function is kind of nice it's just a zero how can we find our C and our d here what would you do set equal to what yeah here we set the two functions equal to each other right that was that not a problem well here look it you can still do the same exact thing you have xal 0 and x = y^2 + 6 y so let's just set those things equal to each other from here oh how you going to solve it I would do the same thing factor a negative y out you're going to get yeah now by rights you should determine which function is on the top the yal on the right the yal 0 or the I'm sorry the xal 0 or the x = y^2 + 6 y so plug a number in there just to make sure because you notice if you did it backwards you're going to get a negative volume right if you do that can you ever have a negative volume so some of you on your homework who are giving me negative volumes you're doing it wrong you can't get a negative volume it's not going to happen so I'm going to take like a a one just plug in one if you plug in one here you still get zero if you plug in one here you're going to get five so that means this function is on the in this case on the right or on the on the top but for for y functions we get on the right so let's go ahead and try to set up our integral uh can you tell me where we start and where we stop if you want to see this again it'd go from 0 to six you'd plug in the number one if you plug in one that's still zero xal 0 if you plug in one here you get five so that's y^2 plus 6 y that's on the top I heard some of you say from 0 to 6 you're absolutely right what's going to come first again tell help me help me out with that yeah you know what don't forget the 2 pi some I was doing this problem quickly earlier I forgot the 2 pi I'm like wait a second pretty sure there's supposed to be a pi in there cuz we're circular so I forgot all about it don't forget the 2 pi that would make a big difference 2 pi and then what else good so this first part does not change what does change is the G of Y depending on what we have first and second uh what what are we going to put for our G of Y can you help me out with that good do I have to subtract off another function here no it would be zero I'm not going to show the zero but if you had a different function right now You' subtract off the second function in this case the zero would be on the bottom now I forgot something kind of crucial what am I forgetting here yeah that's that's huge okay well walk me through it again what are you going to do well we're pretty much good to go as far as intergral inter goes now nothing too tricky about these besides the setup and making sure you have them just rock solid and plugging the points in if we do that integral we're so far along right now I mean I don't even have to ask you for it I know you can do it you're going to get y 4 over 4 you're going to get 6 y Cub over 3 which eventually we're going to simplify that down to 2 y cubed and you're going to be going from 0 to six so that's our 2 pi if we plug those numbers in what you get just make sure you don't do this okay watch this negative that does not go with the exponent you know the difference right if I had negative Y in parentheses yes y 4 no what this means is 6 4 over 4 it means like this it doesn't mean with that negative included that would change your problem drastically wouldn't it instead of a positive you get or a negative you get a positive if you did incorrectly plus I'm going to change that to a two * 6 cub and I'm going to check for the zero still now I know Zer is going to give me zero and zero I'm just going to put it up there to make sure I don't forget it anywhere that way I don't lose track of anything that I might need any fractions now if you do 6 to the 4th power I believe you get 1,296 can someone double check that for me so you got 1,296 6 over 4 plus oh you know what I made a big mistake do you see it that should be a I don't know where I got the two from it but that should be a six I saw that two oh I did oh I did it right oh look at that I was a genius I did in my head my bad you know why because I was going to do 6 to 4th again and divide by three so 12 6id 3 would be easier for me so either way whatever 6 3r then * 2 what do you get out of that 4 now I know 1296 is divisible divisible by four it's like 300 something isn't it 324 so when you combine those thetive 324 and the positive 432 you get 108 so Al together if you get 2 pi * 108 216 Pi is our volume it's kind of a cool thing right finding volume of these these objects so so far we've done two examples in like couple minutes a piece we've done one where the regions bounded between two curves we take it around the y- AIS we note that it has to be in terms of X for cylindrical shells second one it's bounded by two curves but one of them is real simple curved one of them is just xal Z it's going around the X AIS it's got to be in terms of why how people feel okay with these two examples I want to show you one more we'll set it up I'll leave it to you to finish it up because it's just going to be a basic integral but I want to show you one more here um I think I mentioned to you before that you can do many of these with the discs and washer method you can but it makes them harder sometimes I want to show you that that's example so what I'd like to do is revolve the region bounded by this this and this around the Y AIS in order to get a a what exactly we're doing a lot of times it's nice to draw a picture so I'm going to give you a picture to see what this is this actually means okay so I'd like to tell you show you show you the difference between the shells method and the washers method you with me so let's get a nice picture going that's one by the way so we're making kind of exaggerated picture because you're going to see that the area we're dealing with isn't very big now if I do y x^2 + 1 note that that's a parabola just a parabola that is shifted up one unit so we have an x s shifted up one I'm not going to draw the other side because it's not going to be enclosing any uh area for us so I'm just going to deal with half of it then we're going to do Y = X + 1 here's + 1 here's X so I get that line that's + 1 x = 1 we talked about over here what's xal 1 vertical just like xal Z was vertical oh I need to make my Parabola fatter there we go fat Parabola we had anorexic Parabola earlier we don't want those that's bad that's be bad so this is x^2 + 1 this is x = 1 and this ISX + 1 if we're going around the Y AIS do you guys see the area we're sweeping out it's the area that's enclosed by those three different curves it's this right here now let me tell you something you can do this with washers or with shells we're g to consider it with washers first I'll show you why we have the shell method because washers would be a little ridiculous to do for washers but let's talk about washers because you really need to see it because on your test I'm not going to tell you what to do or maybe I will but you're going to need to know it so let's talk about washers if we were going this way around the Y AIS for washers would you notice that the washers would have to be in terms of Y if we're doing the washer method around the Y in terms of Y for washers around the Y solved for y for shells you hear the difference right so if if we went around the Y for washers you'd have to break it up the reason why is because you have three different functions going around the Y in terms of Y you'd have this one uh it'd be 1 - x^2 + 1 and then of course you would have the cylindrical uh the washers method so You' have the pi and this thing squared DX like that for wherever your bounds would be you'd also have to solve those oh you know what I even did that wrong why did I do it wrong explain to me if I'm going around the Y why I did that wrong still in terms of X so you'd have to solve these things for X first even to go around the Y so it'd be a tricky problem you'd have the one that'd be easy but then you to solve this curve in terms of Y then take this curve minus that one for this interval here then you'd have another integral you'd have one minus whatever this is in terms of Y and then you go from your balance of integration there so can you see the washer method here do you see why I need two integrals is really what I care about you see the two integrals if we're doing washer method this one minus this one plus this oneus this one would be the only way to do the washer method for this example or if you understand that one yeah now Shell's method says don't care about that anymore Shell's method says hey that just tells me the end of my balance because for Shell's method I want these in terms of X I want this to look like this with a top function look if I eras the purple in terms of X this one is always on top of that one do you see it oh that's nice so in terms of x if we're taking that around the Y using shells all I need to do is set up my integral from where does it start and where does it stop zero to one no problem what's going to go here well the same thing that always goes there for cindal shells we're going around the Y AIS we better have it in terms of X you with me so we have the X there inside my parentheses I'm not going to have one function right here I'm going to have two different functions you just got to be able to tell me which one's on top which one is on top and then minus like the minus what parentheses oh parentheses are those important what's going to be on the bottom little head not if you're okay with the setup for our W for our shells method we got our in terms of X cuz we're going around the Y that's how works for shells method we have the one on the top yeah great x^2 + 1 subtracting off one on the bottom you can really see from the picture here that if I was going around the volume swept out by this entire curve minus the volume swept out by that entire curve gives me the volume between those two functions between those guys you get that as well cool top minus bottom this is the same mcal shells if we do our integral we're going to have our 2 Pi still have an X in there but we definitely want to clean that up x^2 + 1 + x -1 DX X Cub + X2 DX that's 2 pi if we do our integral we're going to have x 4 4 X 3r over 3 we're going from 0 to 1 we'll leave that 2 pi hanging out there just multiply at the very end that's probably the best way you can do these we plug the one in you're going to get 1/4 + 13 I'm going to check the zero to make sure I don't have anything that that's fishy about this I want to make sure I get zeros out of them so 0 plus 0 okay I know I've got zero we got 2 pi let's see 1/4 + 1/3 should give you 7 12th and that will be 7 pi over 6 for our Volume 7 Pi 6 hey we just did three pretty hardcore examples of cylindrical shells method in about 15 minutes that's pretty good right can you guys do it I don't know that's up to you to really handle it did you understand it when I was doing it how many people did feel okay with it now notice it's going to be easier cuz I'm doing it right I mean I know the setup you can if you didn't have a picture of that if you didn't have the picture you'd have to find out where they intersected or at least draw the picture graph it on your graphing calculator but at least find out where it started and where it stopped and then find out which one's on top very similar to what we did over here then the setup the setup is the most important part you got to set it up correctly if you do really honestly is are the integrals hard know they're really easy the integral part of it plugging in numbers is just plugging in numbers but the setup is crucial for you you got to get the setup right do you guys have any questions on these two before I erase them when can't we use C cylindrical shell we we show this when we can't use washer method or when we shouldn't use it when you shouldn't um we can't why couldn't we just stick with shells and go through almost I haven't seen any problems with any examples we've done sometimes it's hard to solve for the functions like if I gave you something in terms of if I did this um around the x- axis you have to go and you have to solve that for X you have to have in terms of Y you have a square root up there so basically whatever whatever the given is use the unless there's something complicated to it use the appropriate form that makes it easier easiest to set it up do the easiest thing possible yeah you have now two ways right two methods three well two really dis and waser same thing and this I mean notice this and this was the same we subtracted functions but the same thing is dis washer uh this is like the this is like the washer version washer version of cylindrical shells this is like the disc version of cylindrical shells if if you will uh but they're the same so you have washers and you have cylindrical shells use the one that is easiest for you the one you have to do the least amount of work we're lazy people right you don't want to do hard way easy way easy way come on all right how many people feel okay about do you feel all right any last questions before we go on the last words you ready for the last section of calculus for us easy um easy easy is a relative term I'll say that the integrals will be just as easy it's just another formula you have to know really uh of course I will derive the formula for you
