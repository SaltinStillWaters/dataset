Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 0.4:  Combining and Composition of Functions
all right now the last bit of review last section that we're going to cover in this class is 0.4 we're going to talk about how to combine some functions I am not going to spend a whole lot of time on this maybe 20 25 minutes or so uh we're going to go kind of quick on it I just want to make some some key points show you a few things that we can do and that's it combining functions really what I need you to to to know is that we can add subtract multiply divide and compose functions that that's really about it uh what we mean by add subtract multiply and divide if I give you these two functions like f ofx = this and G ofx is this you need to know how to add subtract multiply and divide it's it's not not hard it's not a big deal if we want f+ G ofx what that means is we're just going to Simply add the functions together f ofx plus G ofx in our case that means we'd have 1 + < TK 2 - x - 2 plus x - 3 you get rid of your parentheses by Distributing if you had to and then combine some like terms in our case uh we should be getting -2 + < TK x - 2 plus X can you verify that that's the right answer yeah it's so okay you should be able to do things like f minus G ofx which is basically the same thing except you have a minus in the middle you have to distribute a negative you've been doing this stuff since basic algebra which is why we're not going to spend a whole lot of time on it in our case we'd have 1 + < TK x - 2 - x - 3 notice though this is just a little different than the addition with the addition you can just drop parentheses as there's no negative to distribute however what happens to these sides those are definitely going to change you guys see that they're going to change yes no that's going to be minus X and then the plus three you see the plus three so our answer you can verify this later on your own this is going to be 4 + < TK x - 2 - x if you did F ofx time d ofx That's a same thing only you're going to have to distribute so in our case you get something like x + x < TK x - 2 then you'd get - 3 - 3 < TK x - 2 and there's nothing you can do to combine that that would be it maybe maybe factor that back out but I mean you'd be doing circular mathematics so that's it the only thing we can do with with our basic operations is f over G ofx in this case we just put one function over the other in the appropriate order and make sure we have a new domain restriction uh for in our case right here you knew that X could not be equal to three are you guys seeing the three also one one note that I do need to make um when you're doing these functions and they're asking you to find the domain I'll write this out for you the domain is the intersection of the domains of the original uh functions you can't ever get rid of domain problems all you can do is make more of them let me give you one example of that uh so that you see what I'm talking about let's say that I had this and this and I asked ask you for this first give me a little head on if you're okay on how all these came about all right that's pretty basic stuff if you add the ftimes GX check this out this would be the square root of x time the of X yes no how much is the of x * the of X okay so the question is what's the domain is it all real numbers no no is it all real numbers it looks like it doesn't it it looks like oh I can plug all those things in but the idea is where did that come from what functions did it come from can you plug in all numbers to this can you plug in all numbers to that can you plug in negatives to either of those then the problem is even though it looks like it you can't plug in negatives here do you remember the idea with the hole I introduced it to you a few days ago I said even though it looks like it it was just X Plus two looks like you should be able to plug in or xus 2 whatever it was looks like you should be able to plug in two you couldn't right because the domain came from the original function before you simplified it the same thing happens here make this note uh when you're looking for a domain the domain is actually the intersection intersection is what numbers are common to both functions of the the uh the addition subtraction multiplication or the division of those functions so the domain is the intersection of the domains of the original functions that's that symbol that upside down U of the original functions so for here if you were asked to find the domain the domain is not all real numbers heck no even though it looks like it the domain is not all real numbers what the domain is is numbers that are greater than or equal to zero why because that came from my original two functions that's what those are coming from how many people understand that but you can't just look at the final answer and give me a better domain I I said this it it was actually kind of a key point from a few days ago I said you can't ever make a domain better all you can do is make more problems that's all you can do by combining functions we can't change the domain of this all we can do is make it worse by doing this right that made it worse you actually have a bigger problem here with that three you can't fix domain problems all you can do is make them worse somehow that sucks but it's true does that make sense to you you can't ever fix it all right last thing we're going to talk about uh we can also compose functions this will be the last thing that we do just make sure that you know how to do compositions I I'll go really quickly through this this is an intermediate algebra concept so I'm going to make sure that you know it uh what we need by compositions is if I have f ofx xal like x 3 - 4 and G of X is theun X we're basically just substituting in one function for another so these two things unless they're inverses will have different answers if they are inverses their answer will both be X that's how you tell whether two functions are inverses or not so F of G ofx I'll go through this one time uh you make it f of G ofx or even said the same way then you start your substitution you write F of what is g ofx so we're going to write f of x what this says is you look at the function f what's the function f right now read it out loud to me x- yall see that's x cubus 4 let let me kind of go back a little bit I think I've lost some of you what we're doing with compositions is inserting one function into another function so how you start with it the letters are in the same order here and here F of g ofx f of G ofx then we do a substitution we actually do the composition G ofx becomes what G ofx is so G of X we're writing otk X you with me on that the only letter that's left that represents a function is the letter F agreed so you go to that function f says what was it again everyone say X good you say it again your X Cub - 4 x Cub - 4 you get it then everywhere you said X replace that word with the word parentheses so instead of X Cub minus 4 you're going to do parentheses Cub - 4 do you get that and that's what you write you okay F was X Cub - 4 I'm going to write parentheses Cub - 4 parentheses cub four you okay with that so far whatever was in this parenthesis now goes in that parenthesis and that is your composition that's as easy as that okay we can do it that way for every composition you have the other way you would have G of F ofx that is g of well F ofx is X Cub - 4 the only letter that represents a function is G I look at the G it says Square root of x so I think square root of x square root of x square root of parentheses so I'm going to write square root of parenthesis why because G said square root of parenthesis right there what goes in this parenthesis what goes in that parentheses whatever was in this one and that's how you do your your composition how many feel okay with the composition that's a real fast way to do it last compositions that we need to talk about in the last 5 minutes or so you should be able to do like multiple compositions as well so for instance if I say something crazy like you got three functions compose all of them should be able to do that so let's say that we had like f of x G is 1 /x H is X cubed can you do they used to call them fog and Goff right can you do Fogo ha can you do that one F of G of H what do you think yeah why don't you try to on your own and see if you come with the same thing I get I'm going to spend about 30 seconds doing it so see if you get it I'm going to do it real nice and slow up on the board okay try it let's see F of G of H of X oh my well that's F of G of X Cub cuz that's h of X all right I got that now I can looking on the inside of my parentheses G says 1 /x true so this says F of G said 1/x that's one over parentheses one over parentheses that would be one overx Cub you see where the X Cub is coming from okay now it's the only letter that represents a function left is f so F says square root of x so I'm going to say okay square root of x that's square root of parentheses root parentheses is 1 XB or if you want to be fancy about it the square root of one is one uh X that that's to the the 1/2 power so that would be the square of X Cub like this do you agree and you can write that as well as 1 x^ 3 power remember those fractional exponents power over root you can do that now if I asked you for this question can you find F of G of H of 8 can you do that what's that mean to do yeah it means find this which you already did right you already have that on the board now can you plug in eight plug in eight you're going to get 1 over 8 to the 3es by the way the easy way to do these without a calculator take oh wait did I give you the wrong one no I didn't that's fine uh I guess you would do it just plug in your calculator what do you get out of that do the three halves one over is it a decimal yeah okay well leave it 1 over 8 to the 3es for now if it's something like a four you could have taken a square root and then cubed it uh you would have gotten right the last thing we're going to talk about oh we got 30 seconds perfect you should be able to also go backwards for instance if I have given you something like u h of x = x - 7 Cub can you write that as a a composition F of G of X can you write that as a composition for instance can you define the inside part as one function the outside part as another function and write it appropriately so that when you compose them it gives you that there the answer is always yeah you pick the inside part as a trivial function X or or or I'm sorry you pick the inside part as one function and then you always have like X the 3 so for instance in our case I would say FX would be x 3 that's the outside part remember how we said parenthesis to the what x was parenthesis whenever you see the parentheses just treat that like an X that's x to the 3 and then G of X would be the inside part and that would be your composition so we should be able to go backward as well how many feel okay with what we talked about good deal
