Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 2.8:  Related Rates
related rates what we're talking about in related rates is how to relate a formula to its change according to time it's change according to time um for instance how is cost changing according to Time how is profit changing according to Time how is a volume of something that's expanding or shrinking changing according to time so uh how what's the volume doing at EX actly 3 seconds is it expanding is it uh decreasing at what rate is it doing that that's what we're talking about here does that make sense to you so I'll I'll give you like an introduction here this is basically relating a formula with time that's what related right to mean for us relating a formula with time here's an example we're not going to work all the way through this example I just want to give you the idea on what's Happening Here and and then we'll start with some simpler ones I'm going to this kind of weird I'm going to start you off with one of the harder examples and then we'll make it easier okay just so you see the idea first let's say that I have this cone that's my cone here and what I'm doing is this cone is underneath a a faucet it's my faucet okay and and water's coming out of it it fills it up to a certain level and then we take and we cut the cone right there so the water starts coming out so maybe this is like a uh some sort of a a water container for a city a huge con usually they're probably cylinders but let's just pretend it's a cone it's same idea would apply for a cylinder but it's going to fill it up to a certain level and once it gets to that level maybe it opens up and that's our idea for this this idea for this related rat problem so after a while I'm going to have some sort of a level of water here true and of course that water is going to be as soon as I open up this bot I I shut this off I open up this bottom and start leaking out so probably pretty fast at first whatever whatever that takes place it's going to be leaking out somewhere now our cone has a couple of Dimensions to it what do you need to know to find the volume of a cone because we're going to talk about volume here in just a little bit okay we do need a height for the cone I heard height first yes that's a height and the radius of the cone is probably pretty important so you got height and radius what I want to do is find the rate of change of the volume of the water with respect to time I know that's a it's a horrible sounding question right find the rate of change of the volume of the water with respect to time that's our idea well here's our issue U does the water fill the whole cone up so that H and that R if you think about this the H and the r stood for the whole cone right if it were filled up that would be the the waters H and R as well however as we lose water what's happening to the H sure and the r is also decreasing as well right so at certain times this is going to have different radiuses and different heights and therefore a different volume volum of water so we're going to be able to I'm going to show you how to do this we're going to be able to find out um how this volume of water is changing at any given moment in time so here's what what you need to do the first thing is find a formula that relates what you want to talk about so basically what are we talking about the rate of change of what so we need a volume so we need to know the volume of a cone first so it starts off quite quickly it says find me the volume of a cone now do you know know the volume of a cone do you know the volume of a cylinder oh boy do you know the area of a circle okay okay let's start there that's the area of a circle right notice that a cylinder is just a whole bunch of circles stacked on top of each other for however much the height is so a area surface area of a circle is PK r s therefore the volume of a cylinder is PK R sare time the height to find the volume of a cone you cut that in thir so it's 1/3 Pi r^ 2 H or p 3 r h now here's the deal um this relates what we want it to relate look at the board it relates volume with the radius and the height that's all of our measurements up here are are you agreed on that you got to have that for a related rate problem but the the other problem is is there any time anywhere now here's how we're going to use implicit differentiation to our advantage you can take a derivative of this equation with respect to any variable that you really want to now some will make sense well we're going to take it with respect to time so we're going to implicitly derive this formula with respect to time because that's what related rate does says with respect to time so find a derivative with respect to time implicitly why can we do this why is this allowed for us to do well think about it is volume changing according to time is the radius changing according to time is the height changing according to Time all of those things are then functions of T functions of time just like y was a function of X in our earlier implicit differentiation problems all of these are now fun well pi over 3 is not that's a constant but h and r and v are all functions in terms of time so we can do that but you just have to be careful because since these are all functions of time do you remember that when y was a function of X you had to take a and put a dydx after everything because it was a function of X now every one of these variables is a function of time so we're going to have a d whatever DT after every one of them because they're all implicit functions of time notice how none of these are solved for T right I can't say h equals this t v equals this t r i can't say that so I can't solve them for T explicitly so I have to treat them implicitly just like we did in the previous examples you're going to see this in just a moment so we can do this because V R and T I'm sorry VR and uh H sorry are all functions of time so we're lucky that implicit differentiation was such a good lead in to this uh so let's let's go ahead and do that we'll take the derivative implicitly of the of both sides so when we took an implicit different uh derivative we did a DD something of both sides to start off with right so this would be a d d DD what t t why T yeah what D DT stands for is a derivative with respect to time or in other words it gives you the listen carefully the rate of change according to the time does that make sense the related rate the rate of change the related rate of change because a derivative is a rate of change according to the time so DDT sure of the volume equals equals well DDT of that entire right hand side as well let's start with the easy side easy side's the left hand side what is uh DDT of V what's it remember V is just a single variable what's the derivative of v it would be one but then you have the chain rule why do you have the chain rule here because is v a function of T so just like y was a function of X and you did a Dy DX V is a function of T so look what this says this says the derivative of V with respect to T this says the derivative of V with respect to T V is a function of T so you have to have that it's implicit it's the implicit way to write sorry it's it's stating that V is a function of T you have to have the dvdt here's what this says in English this says this is how the volume is changing with respect to time that's the rate of change of the volume does that make sense to you you see why we need that dbdt it is an implicit derivative now on the right hand side uh Oh what now oh explain why I need a product rule because two separate functions okay so what are my variables over here are each of those a function in terms of T yes I said all of them were so if we're taking this with respect to T that's a function in terms of T that's a function in terms of T and they're being multiplied that means a product rule how many people see the product rule there okay let's do it m you said the prodct rule um you can do it one of two ways you can take the pi 3 out or you can associate with one of the variables it really doesn't matter I think I took it out I don't I don't know why but it really doesn't doesn't matter for for okay let's see when you do this first derivative this part is going to give you 2 R 2 R what else do I need besides the 2 R oh besides the H I need drdt did you guys all have drdt it's implicit so you have to have not only 2 R but and not only the H but you're going to get a actually you know I'll write this way so you see it this gives you the 2 R Dr DT time H that's this piece right here that's what that gives you then the plus this is going to give you r s sure what's the dhdt what's it going to give you D dhdt CH hands how many people got 2 R drdt and then H and then the r s dhdt do you all get that as well so if we pretty this up just a little teeny bit I'll probably put the H in front of the drdt just because that's like that's how we like to write it so 2 RH drdt plus r 2 dhdt now if you didn't pull out the pi over 3 you have a pi over 3 here and you have a 2 pi over 3 there is it any different no it's the same thing what I really want to you look at we're not going to actually do an example of this one I wanted you to get this idea down but here's the here's what we would have to know in order to figure this out if I said what's the how is the volume changing or what's the rate of change of the volume at and inserted this this question to you I'd have to give you a lot of information you see we would have to know not only the r at that time not only the H at that time not only the D we need to know the drdt so we' have the r we'd have the r that's the radius we'd have the H we'd have that height but we'd also need to know what well we need to know drdt what is Dr DT sure but what's it mean change in the radius over time the the how the radius is changing with respect to time does that make sense it'll either be growing or falling depending on whether we're putting water in or taking water out uh but the the radius will be growing or shrinking so we need to know the rate at which it's changing for a moment of time we need to know that that will tell us how the volume is changing in a moment of time we'd also need to know dhdt what's dhdt stand for yeah how the height of our water is changing with respect to time is it going up is going down what's happening to that we need to know all those pieces what the radius is currently what the height is currently that would give us the actual volume but to associate how the volume is changing that's where we need the change in the radius and the change in the height how people kind of understand the concept of our our da our uh related rates now we're going to go a little step backwards and kind of start simply and we're going to build up to problems like this are you ready for it but if you understand this you understand the concept so let's start off real I'm not even to give you any any background on this I'm just say here's an equation find dydt and here's what this implies it implies that Y and X are both functions in terms of T just like this was okay it implies that Y is changing according to time and X is changing according to time are you with me on this so they're functions in terms of T at T = 1 why don't you go ahead and do this real quick for me take an implicit derivative because this has to be implicit Y and X are in terms of T right now it's got to be implicit take an implicit derivative with respect to T right now for me there's no hard project rle there's nothing about this so DDT of y equals DDT of X Cub notes taking to respect to T because we want to figure out what happens here at dydt and at tal 1 so uh what's this side going to become for you on the right hand side I get 3x squ right and that's it y DX DT look look it I know we have an X up here but are you taking it with respect to x no you're not you're taking it with respect to T implying that X is a function of T so unless there's an X there you have to have something after that just like we had a DX of Y we had to have that dydx right it was in terms of X so this says I need a DX DT show hands how people have that good you understand the implicit form of this that's what that means so let's go ahead let's figure out what happens at T equals 1 oh crap where do I plug in the t is there a t to plug in by the way you can't plug in can't plug that in D1 I shk your battles ship that's what that means no there's you get it that was funny no there's no there's no T to plug in so if I give this problem to you I have to give you more things I have to give you stuff I would have had to give you all this stuff right it has to be given somewhere in the problem so here's what I'm going to say find this out if if x = 2 and dxdt equal 4 at T = 1 at T = 1 no something please X and DX DT will change for certain times so at tal 2 this would no longer be the case but look what I've given you I said find it at tal 1 oh what's happening at tals 1 I've also given you that information does that make sense to you so I've G it matches up I've given you the piece for that so why does it say tal 1 and tal 1 it says find this at tals 1 yes but then I have to tell you what happens at tals 1 I can't just give these to you unless I Define tal 1 either because those things will change for other times now do you have enough information to plug this in you got an X got an X you got a dxdt ah I had the rate of change of X according to time that means you can plug in the numbers and figure this out so this would be what is it 48 units according to whatever time like seconds or hours according to whatever T is what does this mean this means that Y is changing at a rate of 48 whatevers per unit of time that's what that says you okay with this cool all right let's intensify the problem just a little bit so next thing we're going to talk about if you guys ever heard of the xon vales what did it do oil SP yeah and oil is crazy right because it usually sticks on the surface of water and just starts expanding just keeps on expanding now we're going to do kind of a simplified problem you see in the ocean there's there's current and there's drift and there's waves and stuff we're going to do a simplified xon Valdes what we're going to say is that this this small it's a small tank here it's not going to be we're simplifying the problem here uh it's started leaking oil and what it's going to do is give us a radius that's spreading at a certain rate uh we want to find out how fast the area is increasing at a certain radius so we want to be able to calculate model uh what the the surface area of this this oil SP is actually going to be do you understand the question here so let me write this out for you real quick oh by the way any questions on this one too late oil spill here's what we know radius is spreading at a constant 3 feet per second this is one of two cases because naturally if you think about an oil spill the radius should actually slow down right I mean because that area is getting massive after a certain amount of time so the r should actually slow down spreading so one of two things is happening either this is for a very small oil spill right at the beginning or for a certain segment of time which that could be the case or an instant of time or the oil is pumping out more and more and more and more okay okay so you start with a little spill and then you get more but in in any case we're saying the radius of this circle of oil is a constantly the radius is growing constantly okay so a constant 3 ft per second do you see why that would probably not be realistic unless you have a massive amount of oil that starts real small and then really grows do you see that CU I mean 3T a second like here's your your first Circle and then after 1 second uh it is now 3 ft more so can't even do that okay big and after another second so probably over a certain segment of time what we want to know is how fast is the area increasing when the radius is 30 ft how fast is Rus increasing when I'm sorry how fast is the area increasing when the Rus is 30 here's what you do first number one you assign some letters to take care of these things so firstly we need this according to time so we're going to put t for time what other things do we need to know about about this are what area so let's pick a for area okay what else do we need know about this well that's our ultimate question right but I mean just the variables that we're dealing with radius we have a radius so R for radius so the first part really shouldn't be that big of a deal just pick out some some letters so T is going to be your time in our case we only have two of the things that are happening we have a radius and we have an area that's it are you guys okay with our letters next thing you got to do after you assign your letters identify the formula that you're doing so this is step one step one is pick your letters step two is you got to identify what formula you're dealing with and it should be given up there somewhere it should have some relationship that relates all of your letters or everything except for T it should have that so what are we talking about here that's going to relate our area and our radius that's what we really want to do because the t is going to take care of itself when we find a derivative we want to relate an area and a radius can you find think of a formula that relates that yeah it's a circle right it's a circle so in this case our formula is not very hard just says can you relate everything up here and that's the idea of a related rates it says relate these these items I want to compare and so for us sure I have an area and a radius let's relate the area of a circle and the radius well that just says area equals PK r s that's what we're talking about you okay with this so far now D DT is going to come about this but that's what we're asking uh how fast is the area increasing that's going to be this Dad what else are we going to get up here do you see the drdt coming about so every variable you're going to get that d a DT is the rate of change of area according to Time Of course and we're also going to get a drdt now your problem is not going to give you specifically what drdt is and I can say drdt is this but it would be worded in such a way that you should be able to understand it what does Dr DT mean change radi good good it means a change in radius a d whatever that's the change in the change in radius by the way um do you know what Dr DT is going to equal for our specific problem right here it should say in the word problem this says the rate of change of the radius what's the rate of change the rate of change of our radius is it 30 that is the radius what is the rate of change of the radius said it should be how the radius is changing up says the radius is spreading oh it's changing at a constant of 3T a second so our radius here is changing at a rate of 3et per second do you understand how to get the Dr DT and and and identify that that's three in this case so it says the radius is changing hey that's a rate of change that's what we're talking about now after this we're almost done the only thing that we've got to do now step number three take a derivative with respect to time implicitly because they're all functions of time and then lastly plug in the values and you'll have it so here's what we're going to do we'll do it very quickly we're going to take DDT of a we're going to take DDT function of time of p r s there's no tricky rules involved here this is going to be da DT on the right hand side we have 2i R Dr R DT do you see where we're getting the 2 pi r explain to me why I don't have a product rule between my pi and my R why not Pi is actually not a variable yeah it's constant so this says bring down the two great subtract one from the exponent got it but I needed drdt do you see why I need a drdt I've got to be able to incorporate this information somewhere do I need to plug anything for Dad no that's my question that's why I have it over here so you're going to have everything plugged in except for the main thing you're looking for in our case we want just Dad you have to have all the other information plugged in are you with me still so far do I have everything else do I have an R what does it say my R is at this certain time so when when this time comes about my radius is 30 I don't even care what the time is do I don't even care my radius is 30 do I have a drdt three so we're going to have 2 piun * 30 * 3 ft per second in fact I'll use the unit so you see it 30t right 30 ft times 3T per second why am i showing you this well we should end in an area right can I say the area is increasing at 15t per second no because that would be linear area should be in square feet right are we going to get square feet absolutely so we're going to get oh what is that 180 what we've just found out is that for this specific oil spill our area is increasing when our radius is 30 ft our area is increasing at 180 unless I did that wrong well I forgot my Pi that's important yeah that's that's a factor of 3.141592 is that an okay answer the decimal this is great yeah now if if it ask it could give you something more realistic in the back your book but this is exact a high would give you approximation says that multiply 180 * pi that's how much a square footage is increasing per second at this exact moment in time and that's what we're talking about do you guys understand the idea of related rates we're going to try maybe one or two next time not a whole lot because this is basically idea it's an implicit derivative just with respect to time the problem's going to give you everything else all right our last related rates problem here's the idea behind this problem and behind every related rates problem basically we're trying to relate a formula that has all of our piece of information together and we're trying to relate it to time so we're taking derivatives with respect to time in order to figure out rates of change and that's our our whole idea rates of change with respect to time so in our problem here here's what's going on you're launching a rocket from the ground and you're going to televise it so what you want is this automated camera and you're going to set it up at ground level and you want to make some computer program that's going to watch it it's a very sturdy camera have you ever seen the people watching rockets and all zoomed in it's like looks like crap right you don't want to be that guy so you're like well you know we're math ORS so you want to set up this automated thing that's going to go and and the angle is going to be perfect to keep that rocket centered in its graphic the whole entire time you get the idea that's the plan so what we want to do is if this rocket is climbing at 600 ft per second when the Rocket's at 4,000 ft how fast will the angle of elev have to change at 4,000 ft to keep up with the rocket well now here's the deal when we start out this distance is going to be fixed and let's say that we're 3,000 ft away from the rocket so our camera is not going to move and the rocket is going straight up did you get the idea now because we have this Rocket's height the Rocket's height is going to be changing are you with me on that so we can't just call this 4,000 right now we do have to call it h because that is a variable that's going to be changed throughout our problem so our Rocket's way up here I don't know how to draw a rocket uh rocket that looks like an I don't know rocket whatever close to Rocket Flying Arrow I'm really a math dork okay so we've got this this rocket fly it's going to be H feet high we're going to figure out when H is 4,000 what we're going to be doing on this but when we when we come with our our problem here I told you there a few things we need to do the first thing we've got to do assign some letters assign some letters to what we're we're working with so of course we like to have what what's one thing that we're we're going to be relating time is definitely one of them so t for time what's another letter that we might use height good height H we've already have that on there so H for height anything else that we need we have the time we've got the height there's one more relationship up there second what was itel not acceleration the what the angle of the television so we have to have something to do with the angle of this let's see if we've related everything in our problem here's where you read through your problem carefully okay if we've missed anything if we left anything out then we haven't assigned enough letters a Rocket's climbing at 600 ft per second when the rock is at 4,000 ft that's a height we have something for height how fast is the angle ofe angle of elevation that's our angle so we needed to have that how fast will the angle ofation have to change that fast that's a rate of change so we need something to do with time so we have our time up there we have our angle up there we have our height up there okay this is back to our height so we have all the letters that we're going to need right here are you with me on this now we don't necessarily have to have a t in the formula we're about to write because we're going to take a derivative with respect to T we don't need the T but everything else must be related that means I'm going to have to have a formula that relates the height and the angle does that make sense so if I call this my [Music] angle my angle of elevation if I call that my angle I need a formula that relates height and angle I I need to have that is it Pythagorean theorem because you know what a lot of people do they go oh right triangle Pythagorean theorem that covers everything does that cover everything no that relates this and this and that but it doesn't relate the angle which is our main question right so if you use Pythagorean theor sure you can come with a formula and sure you can work some of it out but it's not going to have the angle relationship that we are looking for are you with me on this so can you tell me what incorporates an angle with this inverse it doesn't have to be an inverse it doesn't have to be solved for Theta it just has to have Theta in it you just have to has have the height in it okay tan tan would do it tan is opposite over hypotenuse yes oppj no it's not opposite over adjacent yeah what is opposite over hypotenuse what's adjacent over hypotenuse I'm stret you got you yes tangent is opposite over adjacent so does our does our tangent of theta have to do with the material that we have on the board right now are you seeing where I'm getting that from So Tan theta equals okay what was it again what over what which is specifically in this case what does that relate everything we wanted to relate does it relate the the angle and the height basically is what you're asking are you okay on where that's coming from got to have an angle down there somewhere that's typically dealing with some trigonometry doesn't involve an angle you probably don't have to use trigonometry this one we certainly do now the next thing after we assigned our letters and we made our our formula was what what' we do okay so we took a derivative of time actually before that we identified any rates of change U that's what we did as well so let's identify any rates of change that we have can you read any rates of change right any rates of change second that's a rate of change sure what is changing at 600 ft per second is it the angle the height or the time what is it the height here's how you write that if your height is changing with respect to time at 600 feet per second what would the change in height compared to time B what is that dhtt yeah dhtt that works this is the change in height with respect to time and you know that 600t per second actually we get a little more fancy is it a constant 600 ft per second it doesn't say that so this is specifically at 4,000 ft so it's defined at 4,000 ft that it's climbing at 600 ft per second uh Rockets when you have a a source of of propellant they don't climb at the same rate typically those those rockets that take off from the ground increase speed and increase speed and increase speed and keep going and going till they reach their escape velocity and find that they're gone does that make sense so right here at this 4,000 ft Mark we're increasing at 600 ft per second that's our our change in height compared to time AG is 4, right the height at at when H is 4,000 exactly right when H is 4,000 let's go ahead and let's try to find this what we're looking for is okay well we want one more thing how fast will the angle of elevation change that means how can I write how fast will the angle of elevation change what is that D Theta DT that's the change in the angle compared to time does that make sense to you the change in the angle this is how fast will angle elevation have to change that's the change in the angle compared to the time at 4,000 ft this is what we're looking for right there I'm going to kind of recap just a little bit to hopefully one more time go through this with you so what we do usually you're going to have a picture something to do with a picture here we have a triangle because we're launching a rocket and we have this angle elevation where the camera's watching the rocket go up just hopefully nice and keep it centered in the in the camera space you with me on this so we identify everything that we need to do we have our height we have our angle we have our time that's fine come up with a formula that relates those things that's really on you guys the the formulas usually AR aren't horribly horribly bad but you got to find one that works for you in our case we know that tangent of theta is height over 3,000 3,000 was a constant H that's one of our variables we need to relate so that does it for us then we go ahead and we we identify what our rates of change are the height is going to be changing at 600 ft per second this is the change in height compared to time 600 ft per second what we're looking for is the change in angle right there the change in angle with respect to time both of them have to occur when the height is 4,000 ft because we want to maybe that's our our marker we want to make in our computer program that's an important place for us I don't know I don't do computer programming but maybe that would be important for this particular one what do you do now what do you do now we have our letters assigned we have all our rates are change rates of change done and we're looking for this thing we have our formula what do you do to this formula what are you going to do take yeah take the derivative let's go ahead let's take a derivative of this take a d of that with respect to what let's do it with respect to time so this is implicit differentiation with respect to time go ahead and do that real quick or at least get start on it um here maybe is a hint for you if you're struggling with the H over 3,000 you could write this as 13,000 H make things a little bit nicer really wouldn't matter all that much but you could do that you could you could do that as well that'd be fine um now before we get going I didn't get a whole lot of enthusiasm on this side of the board are there any questions over here are you okay that we had to identify H and Theta and T no yes you sure are you okay on seeing where the tan theta equals H over 3,000 comes from by the way the reason why we get this the reason reason why we do this ahead of time is because this is going to be part of our problem you're going to have a d variable over DT for every variable that you have so when we have H and we have Theta you're going to have a d Theta DT in fact that's what we're counting on that's what we're counting on because that's what we're solving for and but you're also going to have a dhdt so you need to be able to identify that and that's what we were looking for so that's why I have a dhdt right here that's why I know I'm looking for a d Theta DT you're going to have one of those for every variable that you have because it's all implicit it's they're all functions of T we're going to feel okay with what we're talking about so far all right good now hopefully you made it just past this just past this would be okay let's take the derivative of tangent Theta with respect to T keep it in mind this is a chain rule every time because it's with respect to T so the derivative of tangent is what squ what good beta and then is that it because you touched the th with a derivative you have to have D Theta DT so far so good all right uh now other side what is 13000 H when I take a derivative of that the constants there still dhdt good why dhdt because it's in respective time okay so H is a function in terms of time so you absolutely must have a DH DT hey by a show of hands how many people got that good if you didn't get that and that some of you didn't raise your hand if you didn't get that are you okay on getting see squ Theta D Theta DT see where that comes from you every time you take a a function of of theta with respect to time you got to have a d Theta D are you okay on the 1 over 3000 that H that's that has a EXT one of one bring down the one take one away from it that becomes that H to the zero that's one but you need a dhdt that's a must you okay with this so far all right well now we're we're pretty much almost done when you think about it which piece are we ultimately looking for this is this is not what we're looking for we're actually not even looking for the Theta cuz that's the angle we're looking for the change of the angle over time we're looking for this piece how fast is the angle change changing over time you follow me at when it's 4,000 ft this is a constant and that we have a relationship at 4,000 ft you with me so far okay so this one's going to be easy we already have that this one might take a little bit more work let's talk about secant squ thet for a second first thing I need you to understand is that secant Square Theta really means see not that mean see Theta squ keep in mind this is all occurring at 4,000 ft so let's go back over to our our picture here and kind of fill in this the blanks a little bit this is 3,000 this H at a specific time will be how much are we looking at 4,000 that's going to be 4,000 at the moment of time that we're looking at you follow me on this that's be 4,000 someone who knows something about Pythagorean triples tell me if this is 3,000 4,000 very good if it wasn't 3,000 or 4,000 you'd have to do Pythagorean theorem to figure out that Distance by the way the reason why we're figuring out that distance is because we have to Now find what secant Theta is is secant what is secant one cosine so if you found cosine here and just reciprocated you would get secant are you with me on this so let's go ahead let's talk about what coine is what's cosine of my angle Theta what's cosine oh come on don't leave me hanging what's cosine here good specifically what's coine 3,000 over 5,000 therefore secant is 5,000 over 3000 does that make sense to you one over cosine right so secant would be reciprocate fraction you're going to get instead of 3,000 over 5,000 secant Theta will be 5,000 over 3000 or 5 don't forget that you're squaring it are you okay with this so far folks do you see where the 5,000 or 3,000 is coming from do you see where the squares coming from now I'm missing something let's do the dhdt right now as well how much is the dhdt that we were talking about because when we're at 4, ft we're saying okay now we 4,000 give me the rate of change of height with respect to time and that's what this is saying what's the rate of change of height with respect to time what what do we Mark that out as let's make this a little bit prettier can we do that make it prettier what happens over here 5,000 over 3,000 I love that that's nice so I'm going to get 53 s over here we're going to get did you notice something here as well look at the board here real quick did you notice how I didn't really divide by secant squ I I just plugged the numbers in that's okay to do you can plug in the numbers whenever you want to you're just going to have one variable remaining right your D whatever DT you're just solving for that it doesn't matter when you do it you could have divided both sides by secant squ thet would have worked that just fine you're just going to get a complex fraction there I wanted to save ourselves some trouble and just do it on the left hand side are you still okay with this all right let's go ahead and square it what are you going to get Square Times D Theta DT which is what I'm looking for equal 1 let's get rid of 25 you do what say what MTI okay very good so if I multiply by 9 25ths on both sides I'm going to get one the 9 over 125 and keep in mind all this happened when the height was 4,000 that's how we came with our secant that's how we came up with this thing as well so it was dependent on that height are you following me on that the 600 ft per second only worked for a height of 4,000 the SEC Theta only works for a height of 4,000 that's the specific distance we were at specific height so that was when the height was 4,000 I know that's small up there kind of I don't want to write it too big to let it take problem right so you can see it 4,000 what now can you tell me what we just found rate of change slope sure but in this context it's a rate of change a derivative is a rate of change so this derivative says the rate of change of the angle with respect to time how fast the angle must change in that moment of time in this specific moment of time to keep up with the rocket are you following that so how fast the angle must grow in order to keep up with the rocket at that moment before that maybe quicker after that maybe slower but in that moment that's how fast it needs to be climbing in that instant of time we have you understand the idea okay now let's make this a little bit little bit more easy to understand do that division how much do you get don't all talk at once here 72 or something like that2 072 this right here what you just gave me is going to be in radians per second radians per second could you please translate that into degrees so because we typically if I say 0.72 radians per second you really can't grasp that can you you know it's hard for us because we don't really deal with radians all that much translate that into degrees for me that means you'll multiply by 180 and you'll divide by pi multiply by 180 divide by pi you get [Music] 421 three yeah that's what do 0.72 radians is 4 13° per second is that more understandable 4° so at this moment of time so the rocket takes off right climbing 1,000 2,000 3 gets to 4,000 ft that camera better be keeping up with it at a at a growing increasing rate of 4.13 De per second so it's got to climb 4° in that 1 second at that moment of time now it's not even going to pass a whole second but at that moment it's climbing at a rate of 4.13 De per second do you guys understand the idea is a math all that hard not really this is probably the hardest part right there and that's what's going to be hard for you is coming up with a formula figuring out how to relate these pieces together after that look what you're doing you're just taking implicit derivative you're just dering it making sure you have a d variable over DT for every variable you have the everything else we give it to you if not you can find it with your relationship and then plug the numbers in and it'll work itself out um any questions on what we've talked about so far do you understand what we've talked about so far I've been doing all the talking today so any questions before we continue s deal the next thing we get to talk about it's chapter three we're going to skip section 2.9 for right now we might come back to it it's called differentials and linear approximation uh at the end of our our class I hope it you
