Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 3.6:  How to Sketch Graphs of Functions
so let's talk about section 3.6 curve sketching this is basically using intercepts like x and y intercepts uh your relative Max relative men which are go to extrema and your concavity to sketch a curve to graph it to see a really good approxim of what it looks like without a graphic calculator now yes your graphic calculator will do it for you but to understand why these graphs are shaped the way that that they are you need the calculus you really understand why they are the way that they are should we do an example yeah let tell you what I'll do I'll give you an example and I'll give you the steps as we go through that would that help you so here's your example here's your example and I'll tell you how to do this problem verbatim just exactly like you should all right with every single step step number one when you're graphing any curve is well you want to find out as many intercepts as you can X intercepts and y intercepts that's always a good thing to do right because in most cases that gives you at least an approximation of what you're talking about where you're crossing the y- axis where you're crossing the x-axis so step number one every time you're going to find the intercepts by the way how do you find X intercepts how do you find X intercepts y say it yal 0 y equal 0 so set the equation equal to zero that's how you find X intercepts you set equal zero you solve for x that's going to give you any Roots that's what a root was right when you said function equal to zero and you solve for x you're finding out where it's costing the x axis that's the whole exact idea should make sense right because if you set yal to Z that means you're going to find out everywhere you cross the x axis you believe me now the Y intercept is quite a bit easier by the way you only do this step if it's easy easy easy means it's quadratic or lower or it's already factored for you okay so cubics don't spend your time factoring them um if I give that to you on a test I'll just give you the X intercepts I'll say here are your three x intercepts you follow me on that so if it's if it's easy do that easy means so I know this is recorded so you don't cheat me easy me easy means quadratic linear or if it's already factored for you that's easy everything else cubic or higher is hard unless you can just see a route right off the bat that would be considered easy believe me with be okay if it's easy for y intercepts uh how do you find Y intercept easy really easy to do xal Z so X plug in zero you plug in zero for x and it'll give you Y intercept that's the easy one that's nice you all need to find that for every single one of these if it exists let's try it let's try so this will be step number one I'll try to write every step for you step number one solving for x intercept how do you solve for the x intercept well this is just basic algebra you're going to take your function you're going to set it equal to zero and you're going to solve for x so we will have x + 2 x - 1^2 = 0 can you find your X intercepts from right there that's great that's great because it's already factored for you can you tell me what's one of your X intercepts you'd have x + 2 = 0 x - 1 = 0 because a zero product property so x = -2 very good and x = 1 you have two x intercepts orig I feel okay with that if this been factored for you you just skip it i' give them to you okay uh part two of Step number one is find your Y intercept Y intercept says you need to plug in zero for x and see what you have so I'm going to take 0 + 2 * 0 - 1 squar don't forget to square before you multiply uh what is 0 - 1 1 2times is two you get two the Y intercept is two do you feel okay for for this so far all right step number two step number two applies only to rational functions it does not apply to pols because pols do not have this I'm going to put step number two in a little asteris the as means for rational functions only for rational functions a lot of times with rational functions you're going to get some ASM tootes right you're going to get some holes so for rational pols don't have those it's continuous everywhere you don't have ASM tootes you don't have holes so this is why it's only for rational functions you're going to find all the ASM tootes vertical and horizontal and any holes do you remember when vertical asmp tootes exist denominator equals what and you can't when do holes exist okay so denominator equals z gives you ASM tootes or holes if you can cross it out as a whole and you can't TR out ask to vertical ASM toote denominator equal Z non removable whole denominator equals z removable how do you find horizontal ASM tootes good thing we covered that stuff horse Al Asm tootes occur that's what we the whole last section was about it said can you find the ASM tootes as we go to the right as we go to the left that's what we were finding we're finding horizontal ASM tootes at zeros or at ones that's what that did and so what we're going to do here for horizontal asmt you take the limit some more you take the limit as we go X approaches infinity or X approaches negative Infinity you have to do both of them because you know the limit could change remember that one/ thir right it could change so you got to be careful on that take the limit so do we need to do step number two for that problem is it rational so it doesn't have a denominator we're not going to be able to do that if it had a fraction you had denominator with a variable down there then of course we would be doing that right here we don't so now we're going to go on to step number three step number three is you finally get to do some calculus you're going to do the first derivative test you remember the first derivative test you had a whole homework section on that right first derivative test you said equal to zero it will give you two things critical numbers and increasing and increas and decreasing and that's what you care about right you care about where are my Maxes my mens how am I going up how am I going down that's what you care about first test why cuz it's going to give you critical numbers and increase and decreasing or areas where the graph will increase or decrease hey let's try that now we'll get you know what maybe I'll give give you all the steps and then we'll we'll go through it step number four sorry I'm kind of backwards uh 1 2 3 Just Pretend We're reading a book backwards or something step number four after you do the first derivative test what do you think you're going to do next Geniuses the second derivative test what does the second derivative test give you yep the reason why you do it just like Scott said you're going to do for concavity and for inflection points step number five remember a table ah had you make that has the first derivative on the top second Dera on the bottom that tells you increasing decreasing increas all that stuff and tells you con cavity so basically it gives you a picture of your graph right there that's what you make so make the table these problems you know they're very long problems especi oh my gosh especially with rational they take a long time a very long time uh they're not easy well actually they're not hard they they're very time consuming so they're going to take a long time not going to lie number six at this point you're going to have everything you need all right you're going to have your intercepts that's huge you're going to have any ASM tootes you put those on your graph you're going to have any holes you put those on your graph you'll have your critical numbers and your inflection points what you won't have is the actual points right you'll have critical numbers plug them in find all possible points relative relative Min and inflection find your points from the original function the last if you get the points you get all the areas increaseed and decreas concavity grab it okay we're going to get at least the first first two tests done on this thing we already have the the intercepts we got X and Y we don't need to do step number two CU we're not rational we're going to do the first derivative test now don't fool yourself here yes that looks pretty nasty that you say oh my gosh that's a product rule with a chain rule or a general power rule in it that could get pretty hairy and then have to set equal to zero or maybe be a little bit smarter about that probably easier to distribute that right maybe distribute some of those easier ones first that way you don't have to do all those rules if it was to the six power or something firstly that'd be insane but secondly um you wouldn't want to do that so just go ahead and maybe distribute that so why don't you try that right now hopefully you got that did you get that okay keep working step number one we got step number two we don't need it step number three first thing were you able to get that that's your happy were you able to get that yeah yeah take the first derivative do the first derivative test go for it by the way that a whole lot easier to take the derivative than that right try that on some of those graphing ones right that's usually going to be something doable for you at least doable so try some of that so take the first derivative let's do that together uh everybody what is the first derivative when I when I do that what was it what do I do for first derivative test if I set that equal to zero I'm going to get x equals well I'll show the work on that if you really want me to this will be 3x^2 = 3 x^2 = 1 x = + orus < TK of 1 x = 1 and 1 you okay with that so far okay hey that's the first derivative test that's not too bad let's do step number four step number four is can you do the second derivative test second derivative test says well take the second derivative go ahead and do that now take the second derivative how much is the second derivative oh that's beautiful I love that what do you do with that 6X when you solve for zero what are you finding here inflection points you're trying to find possible inflection points so when you divide by 6 x = 0 these right here are your critical numbers this right here is a possible inflection point let's recap for just a second before I start making the table for you and then we we'll do the table next time how many people feel okay on finding X and the Y intercept feel all right with that good that's that's our basic algebra do you feel okay with our first derivative test and our second derivative test raise your hand youart with that now step number five this is where all your work happens okay all your work happens right here in step five you're going to have what you got from your first derivative you're going to have what you got from your second derivative and you're going to put all of it on something that looks almost like a graph it's a number line what were our critical numbers that we needed soga 1 positive one zero goes on the bottom why does zero go on the bottom second okay so critical numbers critical numbers went on the top that was our first derivative that's what we got right possible inflection points that's from our second derivative that goes on the bottom of our table it has to be in order 1 01 do you feel okay with that so far what do you do now start testing numbers on so every single interval here you follow what number you going to check here and where are you going to check it in the first derivative what are you going to check here what was itative one would work right doesn't matter negative 1 you're going to check it in the okay why don't you go ahead and do that fill that table out for next time because that's where I'm going to start next time if you want to hang out for a second I'll do it right now okay uh for this one if I plug in frime of -2 if I plug in frime of Z I can do that and frime of one I'm doing my first derivative I'm going to get positive I'm going to get negative and I'm going to get positive that means increasing decreasing increasing you follow me on that yes or no okay second derivative I'd try fpre of negative 1 i' try F Prime of positive 1 remember it's just this inter it doesn't mean you can't plug those in for your second derivative that's okay1 gives you negative concave down positive one gives you six that's positive concave up show hands some feel okay with their concave down concave up that right there is a picture of our graph we're done with step five this basically tells you up down up we just have to find some points and we'll graph that next time let's finish that problem we're dealing with basically just a polinomial uh we know that we can take a first derivative pretty easily if we distribute we've already done that we found first derivative test second derivative test we have our intervals of increasing decreasing intervals of concave concavity up and down we also have our relative which one's this Max or Min relative Max relative and good Reflection Point what we don't have is actual points right we need the points now so the steps that we haven't done after you've done your first and second derivative test you've made me the table what I want to see is your your points now I know the X intercepts automatically give us some points basically 1 Z -2 0 those are my X intercepts my Y intercept will give me another one 02 so x intercept Y intercept but then all of my critical numbers my critical points like my relative Max and Men that's more points my inflection point that's another point so you need also give me are you okay on the 1 0 and the -2 0 it's my X intercepts my Y intercept is at 02 that's what we we got those from we did that last time right if you don't remember that look back at your notes or look at that video we did that last time now those were X intercepts y intercepts we also have relative Max we have relative Min and we're going to have an inflection point just one in this case can you please tell me what's the x coordinate for my relative Max the x coordinate for my relative max1 would be the x coordinate from relative Max you follow how' you get the zero plug the original good the original one is what gives you points so to find our points out you take the negative one plug it back up into here or or this one would probably be a little bit easier and that will give you out the yv value you follow me that gives you your your points so this is going to be 1 let's see 1 + 3 two two I think so I don't know tell me it is happens right it's all good what's a little point between friends huh a moot point right right okay - 1 + 3 + 2 4 uh find your relative men what's the x value for your relative Men Please what is that so I'm going to put a one here how do I find the Y value ah look it in that one's going to be that one's inflection point can you please tell me my x coordinate for my inflection point zero Z comma that's an interesting point isn't it not only is it the Y intercept it's also the inflection point so we have that point twice not a big deal you feel okay with the points here's how to label them on your graph what you're going to do just work your way down just like we did with the process start with your X intercepts 1 Z put a point -2 0 put a point those are my X intercepts my Y intercept is 02 put a point relative Max happens at -14 put a point relative Min happens at 1 Z put a that's already there now here's how I like to label these points are you okay on firstly the four points that we get I mean we have 1 2 3 4 we have six of them listed but two we have two pairs of points here's also what I like to do when you have the inflection point you need to label it inflection point that way you see the change in concavity so which one of these is inflection point well it was the 02 one so I'm going to label that inflection point just IP just so you know it's IP for your relative exema your relative Max and relative men what I like to do I like to draw a little dotted line so for my relative Max which is at4 I like to do that that says I can't go above that for this one this this one zero that I know that was a relative men right I'm going to do this I can't go below that I know that my graph is going to bounce off of those those dashed lines do you follow me on that that's what's going to happen here it's going to it's going to we'll follow in our graph go up bounce off hit INF Flex Point bounce off and then keep going forever does that make sense to you so label those things with something like that do the inflection point changes concavity do your relative Max relative Min do little Dash lines that way you know you're not going to go past that you're going to be changing at those those values so let's see if we can graph our our graph if we follow this table and Associate them with these points we should have a pretty good looking graph it says you're going to start out you're going to be increasing which way is increasing this way or this way this way so we're we're increasing how are we increasing concave concave down so increasing concave down increasing this is concave up this is concave down you follow we're increasing concave down it says increasing concave down we're going to go through that point so increasing concave down it's going to be hard to draw that way I tried to do it increasing concave down are you follow me on this I'm going to hit that what it says a relative Max increasing concave down relative Max then I start decreasing how am I decreasing look at the board here real quick how am I decreasing for this interval it says you're decreasing but you're doing it concave down you follow me so for this little interval right there it says xals 0 right says from to1 on the x-axis you're increasing concave down from negative 1 1 to Z 1 to 0 you're decre you're decreasing concave down that's this way decreasing concave down you still okay with that yes no after zero after zero it says I'm still decreasing but now I'm concave up that's that's like this decreasing concave up so that was my switch in concavity I'm still decreasing from 0 to one from 0 to one I'm still decreasing but I'm concave up as best you can after xals 1 that's why I made the point earlier in the class that you have to follow the x- axis right you got to be on that so you go okay after xal 1 I'm increasing again and I'm concave up increasing concave up looks like that that probably should be a little bit more narrow but that's the idea can you get this graph from this picture of the graph how many feel okay with that so follow along the x-axis start from the left work your way right increasing concave down till xal 1 right there we have the point for that for that little interval decreasing concave down right there for this next interval decreasing concave up right there last interval one from xal 1 on increasing concave up and we have our we have our picture now of course it's just an X cubed so we kind of have the picture of that anyway but the double Root's interesting right we were able to find that we able to find all these points that's a pretty accurate graph fairly accurate how many people feel just fine with it all right now we're going I'm going to eras this because take us a long time a lot of lot of board space to do these problems we're going to graph some rational equations you ready for rational rational are harder first because the derivatives are harder and second because you have ASM tootes that's what makes them harder so I'm going to try to get through two today we have about 40 minut uh 30 minutes or so 35 minutes right now so they they take a long time uh we're going to try to get through two oh yeah were there any questions on that now the question is do I do that on purpose H you'll never know I'm not going to rewrite the steps because I gave them to you last time they're on the video if you need to check those out again the steps were 1 through seven Number One X and Y intercept number two ASM tootes if it's rational that's why we didn't have a number two up here three first derivative test four second derivative test five is make the table up six is makeing points and seven is graphed so we're going to follow the same seven step process the whole way through by the way we are going to be deal with some roots on this so if you take get your calculator out I'm going to need some help calculator words um from you on this okay so x^2 - 1X Cub step number one hopefully the algebra type stuff you find your X and your Y intercept so we're we're going to do every step together here x intercept would happen where you set your function equal to zero you follow me set your function equal to zero and then you you solve it well if you set your function equal to zero basically that's just where the numerator equals z the denominator if equals z it's undefined so we really just say okay well even if you want to think this way multiply both sides by X Cub you still get x^2 - 1 = 0 what are my X intercepts say what and one and negative 1 very good you add one take square root or factor either way you're going to x = 1 1 are you okay with that so far you sure so numerator equals z no problem that's how you find your X intercepts for any rational function numerator equals z you got it now Y intercept Y intercept says you plug in xal 0 and you find out an answer what do you get when you plug in xal 01 over that's a problem that means there is no Y intercept and we're going to find out why in Step number two but does not exist I'm going to erase little parts so we we save space but this is from x^2 - 1 equals z that gave us the one and negative one step number two oh step number two is a good one step number two is a good one step number two is where we find out all the ASM tootes now you might be thinking who cares about ASM tootes don't we have increase and decrease the ASM tootes tell you most of what you need to know for your graph they really say here's your your sections here's what you're going to do in those sections basically if you knew the asmp tootes you can almost guess what this graph is going to look like with just a couple numbers so we're going to find our ASM tootes both vertical and horizontal how do you find vertical ASM tootes no not derivatives we don't do calculus till step number three by the way denominator equal zero good when the denominator equals zero you're going to have discontinuities right those discontinuities are either holes if you can cross them out or ASM tootes if you can't so you'd say x Cub equal 0 and x has to equal Z zero can you cross out the X Cub with anything so then what that says is there's a discontinuity a vertical ASM toote occurs where X Cub equals 0 or in other words x = 0 that's going to give us a vertical ASM toote at x equal Z now just careful if you were able to cross it out you would do that okay you cross out that discontinuity you just keep it in your mind that there's a hole there all right you'd have to identify the hole so it's it's a little bit easier in ASM toote you cross out the problem you say there hole exists at this point and you put a hole on your graph does that make sense to you that's what you would do I think I've shown you how you do holes uh I think I gave you x^2 - 4x + two the hole would exist actually minus two the hole would exist at uh I did plus two at two and then you would find that value you put a little circle there and it would just be an undefined little point you follow me on that okay so that's what you would do with holes most of the time I'm going to give you ASM tootes most of the time you will have some holes most time astes how do you find horizontal Li yeah you're right a limit as what as xes so really there's two of them right you got to check both don't just assume that it's going to be the same a lot of times it is but we've seen cases where you have different horizontal Asm tootes hey do you remember how to take limits of uh of that stuff I hope you do because I think that's what your homework was on right hope so how do you take a limit as we approach positive infinity or negative Infinity don't Mumble it say it div by the B div by the highest power very good in the keyword denominator not numerator denominator so we would be dividing by X Cub both here and here if we did that it's going to look identical to this you'll get x2 XB - 1 XB all XB xB can you see that this is going to go [Music] to zero yes no yeah if you want the rest of it here it is I I'm just going to do I'm doing this one right here you got 1X - 1X Cub all over 1 true yes no okay 1X 1X Cub 1 tell me something ladies and gentlemen you need to know this when X goes to Infinity what's this do what's this do what's this do stays at one that's 0 over one that's zero now just think through it think through it is there going to be a difference if we go to negative Infinity this would still work right you still do that you still have exactly this thing you follow me now take it to negative Infinity what's one over negative would be over here right now what's 1 over negative Infinity it's still zero What's one over negative Infinity it's still zero this would still be zero and that's still a positive one cuz you're dividing X Cub by X Cub no matter what it is that's going to be a positive number positive one you follow me on that you sure yes no I see some not like questions are you okay that this is equal to zero yeah okay if it was going to negative Infinity so let me just change the problem here now let's say aha aha ah does anything change is it still zero so where are our horizontal asmp tootes zero both left and right both left and right so horizontal ASM tootes occur at yal 0 both positive and negative Infinity would you mind if I erased this do you need it so I I've taught you how to do the limits you do the limits um also you're going to hate me for just telling you this but you can see it just by looking at the limit where's the power bigger top or bottom that's something over infinity right that's going to be zero where's the power bigger top or bottom that's something Infinity that's going to be zero however you want us if I want you to show it yeah I want you show it but at least you can check your work really quick right so this means as we're going to the right we're going to zero it's going to to left we're going to zero how many people feel okay with what we've done so far any calculus not really just limits let's start doing our step number three what step number three do our first test now I know you all know how to take the first derivative so I'm going to start doing these first derivatives a little bit quicker just stick with me on these derivatives once you would do take your quotient Rule and you're going to have this minus this all over that square still okay so far I I'll show the work if you really want me to low D High minus high D low Square the bottom and we're okay y XB * 2x - x^2 -1 * 3x^2 all over X to 6 yes no yes okay so basic derivatives actually uh the what you do with them later kind of sucks but basic derivatives so far y Prime equals 2x 4 - 3x 4 + 3x^2 over x 6 so far so good distribute deal with those signs you see where the plus is coming from I hope y Prime = x 4 + 3x^2 all over x 6 can you keep going can you factor simplify yes factor out an X squ that is going to make your work later easier would you agree that that is your first rotative l J are you okay on your first R did I've gone kind of quickly through that but I'm assuming that at this point you can do a quotient Rule and simplify it you follow me now have you feel okay with it so far what is this I know it's a first derivative what is it increasing or decreas it's going to give us increasing decreasing because this is a it's a slope and if slope is positive you're increasing slope is negative you're decreasing if slope is zero you have a potential relative Max in you follow me so what we're going to do for the first derivative test is you go okay now I want to set this equal to zero and what we're going to do on this is pick out all the points that are undefined and all the points that have a zero so can you please tell me for my critical numbers that's what we're talking about here for critical numbers critical numbers the first one I see is xal 0 where am I getting x equal 0 ladies and gentlemen that tells you that right that says xal 0 is an undefined point for your slope that could mean that you're changing between increasing and decreasing does it have to no but it could it could mean that do you follow that so you have to have the x equals z make sure you have where the denominator equals zero on your critical numbers and for your inflection points later got to have that secondly you're going to set the numerator equal to zero that's the same idea as over there it's very much like finding Roots numerator equals z is going to give you the actual numbers that makes your slope equal to zero you follow me on that one okay so if you want to multiply by X to 4th you would see the same thing wouldn't you wouldn't you yeah okay how do you solve that I would probably add x s and then divide and then take a square root and you could subtract three divide by1 take a square Ro just more work um but you're going to get some somehow you're going to get x^2 = 3 3 true well that means that more critical numbers occur at plus orus < 3 so I have x = 0 x = < tk3 which is why I had you take your calculators out because I can't do that and negative root3 those are my critical numbers you okay with your critical numbers yes no take a square root of three you have 3 and < tk3 1.7 something what's next now the reason why we simplified this as much as possible is for our second derivative let's go ahead I'm going to do the second derivative why don't you try on your paper as well U see if we can match up the right answer so step number three sorry set number four is our second derivative okay for for oh that's not was bad as you thought huh hopefully not as bad as you thought did you get that far if you're still going still go that's fine um distribute combine like terms Factor simplify you're going to get down to that point let's all let's all make it down to this point are you okay that that is your second derivative you know how to do the second der already that that's that's not the issue with this this problem okay I know you know how to do that your point now is let's find our possible inflection points or the the numbers where we are going to change concavity can you tell me from here the numbers where I'm going to change concavity I'll tell you one of them so possible inflection points I'll tell you one of them one of them is xal 0 how am I getting x equal Z yeah in fact you know what that's kind of a key point for us that was an undefined point from the very beginning right if you take a quotient rule look at that it's going to come back again because you're just squaring it take a a second quotient rule it's going to come back again because you're you're you're just squaring it so that's going to be undefined it's going to be a critical number it's also going to be a possible inflection point where we change concavity it shows up a lot in our problem you okay with x equals z now the factoring is nice for us cuz it's says if you set this equal to zero which is what you're supposed to do you can clear out the denominator we had to include that point because it did make an undefined second derivative so we do have to include it the x equals 0 but now you can say ah 2 * x^2 - 6 = 0 you set the numerator equal to Z are you with me on that one yes no yes okay but the the two does the two do anything for you so if you divide by two basically you're going to get x^2 - 6 = 0 you're going to get x2 = 6 and you're going to get okay yeah I understand not very nice numbers I get it but can you find them yeah now the point is as soon as we do our first and our second derivative we're going to make our table up from our first derivative it said you're going to have something special happen at zero maybe you're also going to have something special happen at the sare < TK of three and the negative < TK of 3 are you okay with the points that we got from the the first derivative everybody are you all right with that negative root3 0 Z especially and the root3 are you okay with that one now the next one says okay you still have from our possible reflection points zero then you have Root 6 Root 6 to the left or to the right of root3 it's actually pretty important to put this in the proper order right so you have to have Root 6 over here somewhere andun 6 now we're going to do what with this after you find those numbers are they hard to find not really not really what do you do now after you you have the3 03 what do you do plug them into theives wait plug that in yeah that's going to give you zero test them original function if I plug that into the original function that will give me points which I'm going to have to do in Step number six interal look you need to know what happens here you know what happens here here here here here here here all those little intervals right got to know which area to plug him into where am I going to plug in points from all these four that's why we have that first Riven and these are going to go into the second derivative so let's go ahead and try that for this one I'd plug in -2 I'd plug in 1 1 and positive2 we do it in the first derivative so if I plug in -2 here so frime of -2 frime of1 frime of one frime of probably pos2 I don't really care about the actual value all right I really don't I care about the sign positive or negative so we're going to take -2 plug it into the easiest one to work with that's this one if I take -2 I know I'm going to have -4 + 3 that's a negative number over a positive number did you get a negative as well yes negative hey hey what's negative mean in relation to this decreas decreasing very good because it's a slope negative slope means decreasing plug in 1 if I do negative 1 I get remember that you don't Square this negative right that says negative x^2 so this will be -1 + 3 that's 2 over it's posi what's positive me increasing increasing don't just say up because that could be misconstrued as concave up I want to say increasing or decreasing how about one let's try one if I try one do you see I'm going to get the same exact thing as negative 1 CU that says1 + that's positive over that's positive so is that a relative extreme this one no that zero actually didn't change right we're increasing and increasing again that's interesting how about that the two negative it's going to be negative yeah for sure you plug in the two you get Negative over positive that's a negative now let's try our our second derivative if we do for those of you who really have the hang of this can you do me a favor right now can you start finding points I think I can pretty much take care of the zero but I'm going to have a hard time plugging in The Root of3 < tk3 6 andun 6 um so if you want to try this as I'm going through the second part if you really get the grasp this left side of the room my left side you guys try the root three and three root3 um you guys try thetive root6 and Root 6 in the original original okay can you do that for me give me to like the first I don't even care the first decimal is fine to.5 or whatever now for our our second derivative we're also going to try some values in these intervals but you're going to plug them into the second derivative so F Prime of that's going to be like -3 double Prime of1 double prime one dou prime positive 3 if I do that if I do that if I take the3 over here that's going to be a positive over a negative I have a negative what's negative mean by the way when I'm talking about second derivative concave down if I plug in negative 1 notice what we do we've got 1 - 6 that's over a negative that's going to be a that's a positive concave up if I try positive one here I'm going to get a negative over a positive that's going to give me a negative and if I try three I have a positive over a positive that's going to give me a positive by I show at hands how many people feel okay with our concavity at this point right are you guys okay with this you guys here yes no so we checked this in the second derivative we got this was a negative interval positive interval negative interval positive interval concave down up down up were these inflection values does concavity change here and here and all all of them actually we had different concavities step number six is you have to find all of your points so right down here I'm going to write my points I know for my X intercepts I'm going to be at 1 Z and 1 Z my Y intercept I didn't have any so that just came from my X intercepts now I also have all all this junk over here so my relative Max and relative Min can you tell me which one of these is going to give me my relative maximum my relative maximum is it going to be the negative root3 or the positive root3 positive this one's going to be a relative minimum so relative Max relative Min the relative Max will be at < TK 3 comma something I don't know what it is of 3 comma something uh someone who plugged in the < TK of 3 about how much did you get 38 38 yeah yeah okay so let's say 04 is that negative4 okay are you okay getting those numbers do you do you remember where I'm getting these numbers from where do I plug in the root 3s the not the first R not the second but the original function is going to give you points are you okay on that so far you sure we're almost done almost done now let's do the root sixes the root sixes are my inflection points < TK of 6 and the square root of six someone who plugged in the negative square root of six how much do you get now this is everything that you need in this little block to graph this so I'm going to erase this cuz we don't need anymore get everything well almost everything I'm going to leave the asent toes because I need those that's going to be important you're going to kind of see what I want from you on this the first thing that you should do put out your asmp tootes wherever those things are so my asmp tootes are at x = 0 xal Z horizontally both right and left and I'm sorry uh y equal Z both right and left and x equals z for our vertical so we know we have some ASM tootes next thing you do put down your points your x intercept is at 1 Z and negative 1 0 your Y intercept ah you don't have one because you have an ASM toote there you don't have that your relative Max and relative Min Square < TK 3 the square OT of 3 is about 1.7 somewhere around there so the relative Max occurs at okay so there's a slight error in class um the numbers that some of the students gave were a little bit off uh here's the correct numbers now we went through this a couple times so of course if you if you watch the video you're like whoa what's what's going on here why are these numbers changing here's where the numbers changing um when you take the root three and you plug it into the original equation which gives you points what you actually end up getting is 38 if you take > 3 plug it into that original equation you're going to get 38 now when you take the square root of 6 you plug it into the original function what you're going to get is34 and.
34 they're very close points now the graph's going to look somewhat similar but you'll notice that on the video I have that as 1 and -1 if you just change that to 0.5 and .5 and just extend that graph even further this is about what it looks like uh the the the picture of the graph on the on the video is just fine um so here's what you you would end up doing you would still have your same X intercepts you would have your relative Max and your relative men you would have your inflection points they're just really close together so our graph as you can see we're still decreasing that's what this means right here decreasing concave down so we're we're dropping and we're concave down that's that's this way also we have this horizontal ASM toote that's that's what that was so important for was to tell us that our function is not going to be going way up like this I can go way down like this it's going to be riding along this x- AIS so it must look about like that not exactly like that but pretty close to that then from this point to this point that's this little interval it says you're still decreasing but you're concave up you're starting your slope is starting to increase your function is still decreasing but your slope is getting more and more uh it's getting larger and larger so we're going to decrease concave up and then right after that point right here it says you're still concave up but now you're starting to increase and what that does is in increases all the way up until you get to zero now at x equals 0 you have a vertical ASM toote which means that you're never going to reach this y- axis all it's going to happen is if you're still increasing as you get closer and closer you're going to shoot up to positive Infinity so that's what the horizontal asmt said it says you are increasing you can't be decreasing you're you're increasing all the way up until x equals 0 that says horizontal ASM toote and you're concave up the whole way now the other picture is it's going to look very similar to this only kind of rotated a little bit uh starting from zero you're increasing and you're concave down that's this way increasing concave down now because again you have this vertical ASM toote the only way you can be increasing and concave down and have this veral ASM toote is by shooting up just like this you can't come down that would be decreasing so you're coming up like that coming up just like that now we reached this point that is our relative maximum it says at your relative Max you switch from increasing to decreasing but you're still concave down for that whole interval so increasing to decreasing but concave down that's that little point right there after that point it says you're decreasing for the rest of your graph you're decreasing the whole way but now you're concave up the only way we can decrease the rest of the way and be concave up and Associate this horizontal ASM toote is by putting it right along the x-axis just riding that thing all the way out and that's the same picture that you have on your graph that's an inflection point now how in the world does this graph look that's why I have the table this is pretty interesting because we're going to associate all the stuff with our ASM tootes now check it out you know that this has to go close to this one this has to go close to this one has to go here somewhere and there somewhere right now here's what it says it says you're going to be decreasing decreasing is like this and you're going to be concave down that's this way does that make sense all the way until you get to this point that TK 6 that looks like this decrease concave down do you follow me that's the only way you can have it if you're decreasing concave down up here you fail the ASM toote you have to be with the as that's why ASM tootes are important it says you're going to be at that ASM toote right there you see what I'm talking about okay from here to here this little little interval says you're decreasing but you're concave up so this part decreasing down this little part decreasing up that's the inflection Point coming back at us that's this that's concave up you see the the decreasing concave up then this part says increasing concave up that's this way and you actually do that all the way to zero now how do we go all the way to zero where do you think this is going if it's increasing and there's an ASM toote does it magically go back down here otherwise we have another relative Max wouldn't we it's going to go all the way to Infinity there's an asmt folks an ASM toote it has to go to the ASM toote so if it says increasing concave up to zero it's going like this for is there any other way that it could be and still have the ASM toote nope now the rest of it the other side of the graph the side of the graph says for this interval up to rooot three you're increasing you're concave down that's this way you follow increasing but you also have an ASM toote so you have to meet the ASM toote increasing concave down that's increasing concave down until you reach a relative Max you know that's a relative Max then it says for this little interval you're decreasing you're decreasing and your concave down decreasing and concave down that's this way so for here you're going to go up oh down and then from here on out after that Root 6 remember that's our Root 6 you're going to be decreasing put your concave up that's this way and you have to meet that ASM toote that's there as good as we can do but that's a pretty darn good graph for just having some for no graphing calculator that's pretty good how many people were able to follow that now you got to be careful be careful with these numbers you messed me up but that's okay be careful on your numbers on your own now we only got through one example if you want to hang out just a little bit I'm going to try to do one more all right we're going to do one more example how to graph some rational functions I'm going to try to go all the way through it but I'm going to be erasing things as we go so it might help you to write this down as we're going through it that way when I race it you're not like totally lost so I'm going to save some space I only have a limited board to work with so let's start with our x and y intercepts that's always step Number One X intercept says where is the numerator equal to zero that's the only places where this function can actually equal zero if the denominator equals zero then we're undefined we have either holes or ASM tootes so in our case X intercepts are add 8 IDE 2 take a sare root plus and minus 2 that a little bit lower okay y intercepts you plug in xal 0 what you have is 0 - 8 0 - 168 over6 is positive2 vertical asmp tootes those occur where your denominator equals zero and you can't cross it out you can't simplify if you were able to simplify it would be a whole but if you're not able to simplify that's a vertical ASM toote so when we have this denominator equal to zero again well it's different squares you can Factor it you can add 16 take a square root either way you're going to get x = 4 and -4 now x + 4 and x - 4 they do not simplify with our numerator that means they're not holes they are in fact ASM tootes all right now as far as our horizontal asmt go that says what happens when we take X to infinity and negative infinity and that's that's deal with a limit if you notice that we have our leading terms polinomial here polinomial here the powers are the same so when you do that whole divide by the largest power in the denominator thing you're going to divide by X2 what that's going to give you is 2 0 1 0 so basically you have two over one that's going to be two also notice that it doesn't matter if I have negative Infinity either you'd get the same exact thing what that means is we have a horizontal ASM toote at 2 to the right and two to the left so I'm going to erase this now we know our horizontal ASM tootes are at two either way Y = 2 now as far as our our first derivative test second der test here goes our derivatives try to follow along again I'm going to erase this when I'm done m that's our first derivative now what the first it says is slope where slope is positive you're increasing where slope is negative you're decreasing where slope is zero you have the potential for a relative Max relative men or something interesting could change maybe around an ASM toote or something change from increasing to decreasing we've seen that before so the ideas are find all the places where the numerator and the denominator equal zero so in our case the numerator equals 0 when X is or when - 48x is equal to Z that says xal 0 that's going to be one critical number that possibly is a relative Max relative men now where the slope is undefined it's not necessarily a critical point but it could change from whether whether the graph is increasing to decreasing or vice versa so in our case here hopefully you can see this denominator equals z when X is 4 and -4 that's it's not coincidental that that's our vertical ASM tootes those points can come up again especially with the quotient rule when you notice you're just squaring the denominator so three critical values that we're going to be putting on our first derivative table we've got our zero our four and our -4 take a look at this hopefully you've written this down I'm going to erase this right now and write it right up here that way I can work on my second derivative and what we got out of that again was 0 44 okay second derivative test was going to give you concavity so let's take the second derivative see what we get again write this down erase it when I'm done is this is going to be the fourth power since we're squaring that square notice the plus I'll change it right now just make a negative negative into a plus also I'm gonna take a shortcut here I know I tell you not to do this but we're going to take a general power rule times the derivative of the inside and that should be our derivative now we're going to do a little fancy math here we're going to simplify a couple pieces but I'm going leave a couple pieces alone because I want to factor it I want you to see the factorization so hopefully you seen what I've done um I've multiplied the 2x * 2 and this x to make it 4x^2 I've leaving the 48 alone because I want you to see that factor ation it just makes things a little bit easier for us so I'll be factoring out my 48 from right here also I'll be factoring out x^2 - 16 from here and one of them from right here so what that's going to leave us with be careful on your signs check this out factor out your 48 factor out one of your x^2 - 16 what you're left with is negative x^2 - 16 negative and one of those is remaining plus the 48 is gone we have 4x^2 the x^2 - 16 is gone check it with distribution if you really want to but if you distribute this in that's -48 x^2 - 16 2 plus 48 * 4x^2 and then x^2 - 16 so that's the correct factorization almost done one last little step what we're going to do is simplify this a little bit if you look at that that's x^2 + 16 + 4x^2 that's 3x^2 + 16 also we're going to simplify out 1 factor of x^2 - 16 So Gone Part of that's gone that's our second derivative that's about as good as we can make it now what the second derivative is again it's concavity it's how your slope is changing or in other words the curvature of your line of of your of your graph if you will so whether it's increasing or decreasing we can have two different types of that we can have increasing concave up increasing concave down we can have decreasing concave up we can have decreasing concave down just like that so what this says is to find those points where you change where you possibly could change concavity set your numerator equal to zero and your denominator equal to zero the numerator gives you the possible inflection points like the actual numbers the values where you can plug them into actual function and get a point the denominator says where the second der is undefined well it could still change concavity at those places but you probably won't find a point because it's most likely an ASM toote so here if you try this well notice that 3x^2 + 16 is that ever going to be is that ever going to work for you 3x^2 + 16 = 0 well 3x^2 = -16 x^2 = -16 over 3 can you have X2 equals negative the answer is no not in the real number system so here that's not going to give us any possible inflection point so that the numerator pretty much doesn't give us anything the denominator you're going to see again those same points keep popping up even from the beginning of our our function we had four and4 is being undefined that happens here as well so again we're going to have the points four4 okay again take a close look that's our second derivative all worked out for you nice and pretty set equal to zero numerator nothing denominator same points we've gotten before I'm going to erase it and then we're going to talk about step number five we'll we'll plug all this stuff in we'll make a nice table we'll have some points from our original function in uh step number six and then I'll graph it for and what this gave us was 4 and4 again now when we make the table hopefully you remember this from classroom from previous videos if you're watching this on video we put our first derivative up top second der on the bottom it basically gives us a a kind of a a concise version of our graph of our function on a graph so we're going to put all of these points on the top got to be in order and these points on the bottom and what we do is we test specific points in each interval and what that's going to tell us is where our graph is increasing or decreasing for the top that's our first derivative or concavity for our second derivative so I would test the points like5 1 1 and 5 and we're testing them in the respective derivatives so here we'll be using the first derivative on the bottom we're taking second derivative so concavity and we'll test some similar points but make sure you putting them in the second derivative not the first not the original original function gives you points on a graph first derivative gives you increasing or decreasing second derivative gives you concavity so let's try this if you want to try it at home plug in your own points but we're going to try frime of5 that's a negative time a negative this is our first derivative again remember first derivative negative * a negative is a positive that's a positive because it's squared that means that this is positive you don't exactly care about the whole value of it you care whether it's positive or negative increasing 1 well that says * negative is a positive over a positive again that is positive increasing next up we have one negative * a positive is a negative over a positive that's going to be a negative decreasing five negative * a positive is a negative over a positive it's still a negative decreasing second der is tell us some more things it'll say plug in5 but now do it to the second derivative second derivative is right here this is well let's see -5^ s well it's going to be positive plus positive positive oh that's positive oh you know what I made a mistake I think I drew that wrong if you were watching at home you might you might have notic what's Mr L thinking uh that should be a power three I was kind of thinking through that thinking wait a second that uh that doesn't make too much sense so let me change it to positive three and then we're going to we're going to check this point again I think that one's going to work out for us but make sure you have a three right there because that would be a big mistake I I forgot to I erased it before I copied it down so bad mistake on my part uh let's check it one more time let's check the5 so5 squ that's well that's positive * 3 is positive plus 16 still positive * 48 that's positive now let's check it down here we have -5^ 2 that's 25 - 16 well that's still positive and when you Cube it it'll still be positive so we're okay on the concave up it's still going to be concave up this is the one that's going to be changing for us if we plug in zero Zer well that's 16 times a positive number so positive but look what happens down here 0 squ is 0 - 16 well that's a negative what happens when you cube a negative well it's still a negative so this is going to be concave down and it's concave down for its entirety notice how we didn't get that zero in our second derivative so it's not going to be a place where we're changing concavity five same thing's going to happen as neg five we're going to have a positive up here we're going to have a positive down there that's concave up well that takes care of Step number five for us so so far we've found our X intercepts our y intercepts we've gone ahead done our first derivative and our second derivative we made up our table we have all of our intervals of increasing we have decreasing we've got concavity up there we're almost done what we need to do right now is find out some points what our points are plot them on our graph and look at how this is going to be graphed for us so points well our points are already on the board we have our X intercepts we have our y intercepts and we have our ASM tootes you're going to notice that all those points come back again at us we have zero well if we plug in zero you get 1/2 that that was our Y intercept so all of our points are basically listed we've got 2 0 -2 0 those are X intercepts we've got 0 one2 keep in mind what that is though that's our Y intercept and it's also if you look at it it's also this which is increasing to decreasing increasing to decreasing that's a relative Max relative Max is there a relative men no this says increas and increasing decreasing decre there's no way we're having a relative Min here doesn't happen also in in lection points we could try for inflection points we could try for some of these points but you'll see what when you plug them in plug them into your original function You've Got 4^ 2 - 16 you got -4 2 - 16 that's undefined that's how we got those ASM tootes in the first place so these things are all ASM tootes what it means is we only have three points to graph now I told you in class or on the video video that a lot of times you can actually graph these graphs just by looking at the asmp tootes and increasing decreasing I'm going to try to show you that right here so you can kind of visualize what what it's going to be even without the second derivative sometimes so if that's what you're looking for this is the part that you that you want so number one do your ASM tootes ASM tootes are vertical 44 hopefully you're okay with our ASM tootes horizontal says two in each Direction now keep in mind horizontal ASM tootes only work as you're going to Infinities so could you cross it here you could it doesn't mean it's like a a wall for you well that's a it's a wall for the Y yeah for our for I'm sorry for our vertical but horizontal not necessarily so horizontal says two in both directions but it only starts out here the next thing you do after you take care of your asmt and your graph you're going to plot all of your intercepts so our intercept says 2 comma 0 -2 comma 0 and 0 one2 we're going to label what they are too I've showed you that when you label these points well they're intercepts those don't do much for us besides say you cross the x- axxis here but that said you have to be a relative Max that's what that said we listed it as now just think about it even if you don't have the second derivative so let's just pretend I didn't even do the second derivative what's the only way we could fit this information on this graph with just the first derivative so hint hint on that test if you're if you're looking at how do I do the graph with just the first derivative sometimes you can do it this is one of those cases sometimes you can't you need the second derivative but a lot of times if you have ASM tootes and you have increasing decreasing you can picture what this graph looks like here's what I'm expecting from you if you know that your ASM toote goes this way and this way there's only two scenarios you're either going and you don't have any relative Maxum in notice you don't have any of those in this interval you don't have any of those in this interval you do have one in this interval but other than that there's no change in increasing there's no change in decreasing so unlike the previous example we can't do things like this otherwise we'd have relative Max we can't do things like this otherwise we have a relative Min it's either going to be up or down that's it it's the only thing we can have so when you look at it if there's no relative Maxes or mins there's no change in increase and decrease look at the first two intervals it says you are increasing all the way to zero you're increasing all the way so from actually to4 that's where we really looking from infity to4 you're increasing can this be increasing no no that that would be decreasing increasing says this way so to fit this on a graph if you have a horizontal ASM toote and a vertical ASM toote that's the only way it can be that's it now what about what about this section this section says you're increasing from -4 to 0 you're increasing from -4 to 0 and then you're decreasing from 0 to 4 well what's the only way that you can increase and then decrease and have one relative maximum and touch these two points the only way could possibly look is going up and coming down that's it I'll talk about concavity in a minute just want you to see the idea of fitting your graph to ASM tootes first now after positive4 it says you're decreasing decreasing mind you like this no that would be increasing like this yes that is decreasing there's no relative Max no relative men that means you're decreasing throughout means you have to go from left to right downward the only way you're going to fit this ASM toote and this ASM toote is with a picture like that now I have gone ahead and done the second derivative for you and I gave you the the table as well if you want to go that far that's fine in fact most times you really should should I'm just trying to get you to think outside the box here but if you if you compare the concavity with this let's see if it works it says you're increasing and your concave up all the way from negative Infinity to4 increasing and concave up looks like this Ah that's what we have increasing concave up then on this interval from4 to 0 that's here says you're increasing but you're concave down well look at that if you have these ASM tootes increasing concave down that's exactly what we did and we fit it to our points -2 0 and 0 1/2 we had to do that from 0 to 4 you're decreasing and you're concave down decreasing concave down looks like this so from here we're decreasing 0 to 4 and concave down hey that works last section from four onwards we're decreasing and we're concave up decreasing concave up looks like that decreasing concave we got it that's our graph do all seven steps you have your picture but sometimes with these rational function if you if you have those ASM tootes handy you can sometimes take your first derivative and just look at that graph and put it in the right places and the concavity does work out for you
