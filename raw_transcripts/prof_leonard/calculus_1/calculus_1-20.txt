Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 3.4:  The Second Derivative Test for Concavity of Functions
tell me something if the first derivative has to do with slope and the slope has to do with increasing and decreasing what does the second derivative have to deal with good because the second derivative is how the slope is changing whether the slope is increasing or whether the slope is decreasing that's going to give you the shape of your curve concave up or concave down let's just recall how how that works uh so little refresher if your second derivative is that means positive your second derivative is positive what's that mean concave which way up oh that means your slope's increasing right slope increasing does this or well or does this if you're going downwards but it's going to be concave up well that means that if your second derivative is negative your slope is decreasing that's going to be a concave down shape what would happen if your second derivative equal zero good not necessarily an your second derivative equals zero it's a possibility that you're changing concavity there if you're second R is positive you're definitely concave up right your second R is negative you're definitely concave down what do you call that when you well if you switch from concave up to concave down which we can do right concave up to concave down that's a switch and somewhere in there the second gr of must equal zero right that's a that could be a switch and concavity does it have to be not necessarily you need to check for it but it's a possible concavity change and what do you call that right this is a possible inflection or a p at a possible inflection point so let's find out right now how to find some inflection points that's our whole goal for the rest of our day and then tie these things together so how to find inflection points we're going to be using the second derivative test the second derivative test is going to very much mirror the first derivative test what do you think the first thing you're going to do in the second derivative test is second we find the first derivative yeah and then second Geniuses all of you very good yeah you're going to find the second derivative so second derivative test says of course find the second derivative why are we looking for the second derivative that kind of tells you right that tells you it says if you if you set the second derivative equal to zero and solve for it you're going to get all the places where you could possibly change concavity you follow me where that equals zero then you're going to test some intervals just like you did before where you're positive means you're concave up where you're negative means you're concave down that gives you the way that you're changing your curve whether you are down or up so we very similar thing you take the second derivative you're going to set it equal to zero for your possible inflection points set equal to zero for your Pips it's fun to say too pip classic and then you're going to make your second derivative table here's what the second derivative table looks like and you're going to see why it looks this way when I when I put them together finally you're going to have a number line that represents your graph just like you did before with your with your first driv of test just like this and I left this on the board for reason so you could compare this first driven test goes on the top of your graph right the second derivative test we're going to put right below it on the same number line that's going to give you two things at once it's going to give you increasing and how it's increasing it's going to give you decreasing and how it's decreasing it's going to give you relative Max and Min and your deflection points it gives you everything right there so second Dera of test looks like this the possible inflection points go on the bottom of your number line on the bottom of your Gra gra basically you put all of your possible inflection points and then just like we did for our first derivative test we're going to check a number in each interval here and here and here we're going to do that where are we going to do that in the original function in the first derivative or the second derivative this is the second dtive test right we better use a second der because that's what's going to tell us the concavity so we're going to find the sign of each interval by using fime of X I'll write that out for you find the sign I don't care about the value but the sign is important find a sign of each interval by using fpre of X second gr would you like a couple examples on this are there any questions before we we do that does it make sense why this is going to work firsted gives you relative maximum second gives you concavity so inflection points will tell you the distinction between the concavities that's how we're going to use it so let's do the second derivative test let find the the points of inflection if there are any for this next function find inflection points what does it entail finding inflection points what are we going to have to do for inflection points second so let's all take the second derivative right now go for it take the second derivative once you've taken the second derivative set it equal to zero solve for it hopefully you all got that for your first derivative did I do that right do you get the same thing okay then we take a second derivative what would this give you by the way what's the first derivative give you SL increasing slope it would give you a possible relative Max in which is increasing decreasing that's what that would give you not talking about that right now we will in the future but for this I'm just talking about inflection points so second derivative is where we need to be you get 12x^2 - 24x as well what are we going to do with that what now pull out 12 set it set it okay set equal to zero first yeah then we're going to factor do whatever we need to do to solve this by solving this we're finding the places where the second der equals zero that means it doesn't have a concavity that's going to give you every possible inflection point yes no how many possible inflection points do we get not just one right not just that one you also have that zero so x = 0 x = 2 now we get to make the second derivative table looks very similar to the first derivative test we only have a second derivative here and we're going to put both of our possible inflection points on that graph it's got to be in order it's in the order of a number line because the graph is in the order of a number line so the zero has to come first and the two next and these are our Pips remember that's a possible inflection point how many intervals do we need to check three let's check all three we're going to check them in which one the original function the first derivative or the second derivative because that's concavity and we're CH talking about concavity here so why don't you check that I would probably check negative one I check one and I check three so give that a try remember I don't quite care about the the the actual number I care whether it's positive or negative that's what's key F Prime of 1 1 and 3 we're going to plug those into our second derivative we're going to see whether it's positive or negative so negative one looks like we're going to get positive cool how about one how about three what's that tell you in this interval are we concave up or concave down don't say concave up right concave up yeah this is not concave up concave this so we are concave up true shape this way up down up and we're talking about concavity so concave up down up I don't mean increasing decreasing right we talked about that earlier increasing means the function is going up concave up means the way it would be going up or the way it's going down that's the shape of the graph not necessarily the way you're going higher or lower how it's shaped that's the difference now question is that an actual inflection point does the concavity change basically yes from here to here does it change then that's an inflection point what if that had been plus and that had been plus would that be an inflection point that happens occasionally it does uh of not often I mean often it's like this especially pols you get this a lot but if it goes concave up to concave down that's certainly not a possible anymore that is an inflection point is this an inflection point if I look at you long enough you're going to change your answer maybe I don't know I P under pressure concave down to concave up did it change then that's certainly inflection point by the way is that my inflection point no that's the x value for my inflection point let's find the inflection points themselves so I want 0 comma something and 2 comma something because that's my x coordinates of my inflection points I have zero and I have two how do you find points do you still use the second derivative do you use the first derivative or the original function so plug that in and then find out what those numbers are that's going to give you the inflection points themselves so second der tells you concavity but to find the points you're going back to your original function tell you what why don't you guys handle the two I'll take care of the zero sound like a plan be nice to you guys geez I hope I can do it now it's a lot pressure did you get 012 mhm cool those are my two inflection points came from zero and two those are the points we knew there were inflection points because the concavity changes there Rich feel okay with this so far good deal let's try one more then we're going to wrap all this stuff together you ready for it one more but I'm going to have you do most of it so let's start with g of X same question we're going to find inflection points uh x -1 to the 1/3 what are you going to have to do to find inflection points for this nasty looking function huh what derivative first or second why don't you find the first derivative first that might be a good good starting spot find the first right now let's make it prettier and then I'll have you do the second der so go for it so first derivative what do you need to do for the first derivative here Ru chain rule or general power rule how however you speak about it that's fine but you need to know that you're going to do the 1/3 do you change the xus one not right now to which power yeah don't forget the power uh people have notice on your homework you're doing the 1/3 but then you you ignore the power that's kind of a big deal right make a big deal for you so -23 good and then that's it so far so good ends up being that that was actually it because the derivative is one but I do need to show the work 1/3 x -1 to the 2/3 * one because that derivative of x is one so that that's that's done that's our first Der did you make it that far okay now you have an option that was like five people did you all make it that far yeah okay you're getting lazy about your hand raising aren't you you could have the option of moving this down to a denominator right to positive however that's going be a little bit more difficult to take a derivative of so with derivatives leave it that way until you get your second derivative so from right here do you see you can just apply the general power rule again go ahead and do that take your second dtive from right here if you haven't done so already I'm seeing 2 nths you seeing that too to [Applause] the of course that was a general power rule or the chain rule but the derivative of that inside piece that's still going to be just one for you so let's make this thing a little bit prettier how we make this thing a little bit prettier since that's a one this will be -2 over 9 cube root x -1 to the 5th that was a lot of math right there can you follow that you're sure did a lot of stuff in our head we took the derivative and made sure it was one so that's not changing anything that's pretty much gone -2 stays on the on the numerator 9 is on the denominator that negative exponent that's power over root but it's on a denominator power over root you good about that one what do you do for the second derivative test okay so zero now this is interesting when's the numerator going to be equal to [Music] zero it's not it's a constant so you don't get any values from the numerator here that says that nowhere are you going to have an nowhere are you going to have a a point on the numerator that's going to make it equal to zero you're not going to have that value however we do have some some points on the denominator do you see that we're going to have to have that as well since that's on the denominator we okay where is this going to be undefined where do we have an undefined second deriv that could also give us a change in concavity let's look at that where yeah it's nicely facted for you right x - one that's the only thing that could possibly give us zero on the bottom is x - one so we know that from here x - 1 = 0 that's going to give us a possible inflection point do you feel okay with this so far let's make our table up there's only one number so with our one number we've got x = 1 that means there's only two intervals to check we can check zero for one of them we check or whatever you want to check I would probably check two that's a nice number so if we check zero we're going to check it in where the original functions first derivative or second derivative that'll give us concavity so let's let's all try that remember I really care about positive negative that's what I care about so when I try zero into my second derivative I'm going to get oh my gosh negative positive I let's try it what's 0 - one to the 5th power still negative cube root still * 9ga over a negative gives you a positive that's concave up that's the shape of that now let's do the second one do the second one if I do the second one so F of f Prime 2 plug in two give you kind of a nice number 2 - 1 is that's positive fth power cube root * 9 netive positive concave down is that an inflection point is that a spot where we're going to change in uh concavity yes yeah we're going from concave up concave up concave down yeah for sure now find the point all you got to do is plug that number in to find the actual inflection point so I want an inflection point it'll be one comma something where do I plug it in original one that gives you points so plug in one you get 1 - one that's zero can you take a cube root of zero is that okay zero inside of a radical always fine zero that's your inflection point so this goes back to my original function G of one and that's how we did that Z by show hands how many people feel okay with our second derivative test yeah know good all right you ready to put it together do it y let's do both the first and the second derivative test on this next function and see what it actually means it's going to be kind of interesting by the way this is the start of how you would graph a function without a calculator even some nasty looking functions you can do it with this stuff all right I'll show you the the end all of this in section I think 3.6 two sections how you do curve sketching in general curve sketching of anything that you really want to and we'll be able to use all this stuff together this is like the second little baby step we have two more steps to make okay we're going to do both the first and second derivative test but I want you to do most of it so right now can you please perform for me the first derivative test what I want to see is first derivative set equal Z find my my critical numbers and make the top portion of my table do that did you get that for your first derivative okay did you solve it all the way down you able to factor it I hope to me it looks like we should be getting x = -2 and x = 4 by show hands how we've got x = -2 and 4 good you just found your critical numbers that's fantastic the critical numbers stand for the places where your slope could be zero where you could possibly be changing from increasing to decreasing so right here on our on our first year of the test we got okay X is 4 we got X is -2 we're going to get -2 and we're going to get four that's our first derivative test now we get to plug in some numbers so why don't you do that on your own plug in some values for each interval I want maybe -3 here maybe zero here and maybe five here they doesn't have to be those numbers with something in that interval remember we're plugging these into our first derivative not the function that gives you points the first derivative is going to tell you slope which is increasing or decreasing has anybody plugged in3 plug that in yet what did you get positive hey by the way in this context what does the positive mean does it mean concave up concave down increasing or decreasing so the function is going to be going up for this whole interval from negative Infinity to2 it's going up increasing um how about for zero I think I probably do that decreasing increasing yeah show H how many people made it that far did you interpret it correctly for increasing decreasing increasing so here's how this graph look you already have a good picture don't you you know this graph is going to this watch it's going to start from NE infity it's going to go up increasing till it gets to xal ne2 then it's going to stop well not stop reach climax there then it's going to go down till you reach four it's going to go up for you with me on that that's how this graph looks now we don't really know whether it does this or whether it does this something funky you know the shape of that curve is going to be important for us as well that's where the second derivative test comes in so so we've completed the first dtive test told us increasing decreasing increasing we probably have an idea because it's a polinomial that is going to be concave like this and like that but we need to verify that the second derivative test so right now take your second derivative and do the second derivative test I love second der sometimes don't you love second derivativ sometimes so nice except when they're like that I know but uh quotient rules oh my gosh they're horrible but for pols love those things hopefully you got xal 1 as well yeah so we're going to put xal 1 notice how when we combine these ideas it is one number line because it's one graph that means you got to put this in the right spot I can't go xal 1 yay no that doesn't work okay you got to go in between these numbers it's like it's drawn to scale okay it's it's your graph so put it in between the -2 and the four it's a number line after all now if x = 1 tells us our possible inflection that's what that is let's go ahead and let's plug in some values for each interval and find out whether we're concave up or concave down will we plug these into the first derivative the original function second derivative which one second Dera will give you the concavity so take some numbers here probably zero and two plug them into the second derivative and tell me what you get okay negative so we plugged in zero you got6 all that's negative for sure does that mean concave up or concave down this one good because if you plug in something like two you're going to get 12 - 6 that's positive 6 that's positive concave up so we plugged in numbers in the first derivative to give us increasing or decreasing we plugged in numbers in the second derivative to tell us concave up concave down uh true or false we have two relative extrema true or false two relative extrema relative extrema means a relative Max relative men do we have two of those things yeah one's a relative Max where's the relative Max at x equals what number the relative Max at -2 you see thega -2 it's going up it's going down picture that up down that's has to be a relative Max uh where's the relative Min do we know the value of those things not yet but we're going to uh true or false we have no inflection points where is our inflection point one okay here's how this tells us to if you read this it reads like a graph it says check it out you're starting out you're going up right increasing how are you going up concave down wise so you're going up concave down you're going to reach a point look at that concave down going up you're going to reach this point it's still it's going to start decreasing are you still concave down yes until you come to this value then you're still decreasing but you're starting to be concave up you see the change there concave up then you're going to reach this point Ah that's going to still be concave up for the rest of the way concave up but now it starts increasing again so this reads like your graph does increasing but concave down then you're going to be decreasing but still concave down tell you get to here that's your inflection point concave up but still decreasing and then concave up increasing the rest of the way that tells you not only whether you're going up or down but how you're going up or down it would be different if it was like this right increasing concave up that would be different didn't decrease concave up that would be different it would be a different looking graph so this tells you both of them and we'll get a handle on how to do this in section 3.6 all the way through how people feel okay with this so far we've neglected one thing we haven't found the points so I want you to find your points right now do the relative Max relative Min and the inflection point where are you going to plug those numbers into Good original will give you the points see we said max was at -2 something minimum was at four something inflection point was at one something does anyone have the neg -2 yet 50 50 double check on that 50 60 60 wa 60 well it's 10 right I mean who cares okay how about the four the four anyone do the four 4 48 double check yes yeah 48 perfect 48 and the one six six double check six okay tell me what is my relative maximum what is it though 60 60 is the relative Max where does it occur at xal -2 what's the relative minimum good where's that occur cool the inflection point says one six that's where the point is that's where the concavity is changing feel okay about this so far now before we can put all this together we have to talk about one more section it's kind of a long section you see your favorite part we're going to go back to limits for a little bit your fav we're going to talk about limits at Infinity you see we haven't done that we've talked about limits going to a point but we haven't talked about what would happen if well we did a little bit we said what happens if I'm going like this that goes to Infinity but what happens if I take my function and go that way forever or if I go that way forever does it keep going up does it keep going down or does it tend to go to some number we're going to tr we're going to find that out with limits in this section so in 3.5 that talks a little fast so we still have some time
