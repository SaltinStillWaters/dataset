Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 2.6:  Discussion of the Chain Rule for Derivatives of Functions
I'm not a spontaneous person the jokes are scripted you'll never know you're thinking was that scrip we're going to talk about the chain rule today chain rule oh man it's so cool it lets you tie all this calculus stuff together uh this is the last major rule that we have we will talk about implicit differentiation which leads us to related rates something very useful for for you uh but as far as the rules go this is it this is the last derivative rule that you get other than that it's pretty much just applications so that's kind of nice right so basically the rules are product rule equ rule chain rule most of your Calculus rests on that most of your derivative rests on those those rules so what this is what the chain rule does it gives you a way to do derivatives with compositions so let you take derivatives by using compositions and just to refresh your memory on why we might do this I'll give you that example again and it's on the last video so I want to make sure it's on this one as well uh this is the reason why we want to learn the chain rule I I gave you this to you earlier I said can you take the derivative of that thing easily in fact if I if I did this dtive would be 6X and then you're done right and I said I built on a little bit I said okay well what if it's not that what if it is squared could you still take the derivative that's is yeah you probably foil that out right distribute it and then take it turn by term I said okay well what happens if it's if it's cubed and you go I still do the same thing or it could or use the product rule I could still do that distribute one of them use product rule but as soon as we get to things like this and I think this is where I went the O crap right you go come on man are you serious do we really have to do that yeah but if you think you're going to distribute this 100 times I mean that that's just a waste of time so there's got to be a better way to do derivatives of this and as a matter of fact there is it's actually not hard it it's kind of an easy way to do it and you're going to like this so all the times where you had to distribute remember like when you had this squared you had to distribute that right like in the first set of homework you're like oh man this is tedious well and the tedium now this takes care of that so anytime you can see a composition I'm going to I'm going to show you the composition here in a second you can use chain rule so I come with with theme music now all right the question is can I express this thing as a composition which is why I had you cover compositions and had you go with the reverse of compositions looking for a function within a function that's why we did that so we get to this point like oh yeah I kind of understand that idea now so can I express this as a composition and the answer is yeah I can and here's how you do it here's a a pretty basic way to do these things what you're going to do you're going to cover up the inside of your function so what I mean by the inside here is the the 3x 2us 4 you with me on that you're going to cover that up and you're going to go okay I'm going make a function y equal to whatever you covered up becomes an X you know what let's make it a uh let's make it a u a u to the 100th make it a u to the 100 do you see how how I got that do you see that by by holding this part out I get a function it's very basic yal U 100 you see where the U the 100 is coming from but then you have another function to to express you now need to say okay well U is going to be what did you cover up then that has to be your U and that would be a very basic composition do you see if I put the U in for this U this expression in for this U I'm going to get that back again can you see the composition here basically if you cover it up you go okay that's U to the 100th and U is what's under my hand and that's that's how we get those two things have be loated with that so far so sure this is a composition that's not bad at all well could you find Dy du could you find that what's this mean to do derivative of y of Y with respect to what you oh with you okay so so do it what's a derivative with respect to you that should be a very easy one for us you okay with that so far you sure okay can could you find Dux could you find Dux that's the derivative of U with respect to X how much is that going to be that's the 6X are you okay with with these two things so far so we write this as a composition we take the derivative of the first expression that's the like overlying function we take the derivative of the inside expression that's what we chose as our composition to compose into that but the problem is this what we ultimately want to find is dy DX right we don't have that yet we have Dy du we have D DX but you're going to find out right now why we stick with this notation because this is kind of cool are you ready for it if we want to get dydx so what about dydx what about dydx the question is can we put these two things together in such a way that it will equal dydx for instance I'm looking at a dyd I'm looking at a d DX do you notice how the DU here is on the denominator and the DU here is on the numerator and we have a d d y on the numerator which we want and a DX on the denominator which we want what operation can I put between this one and this one so the duus would be gone and I get dydx yeah you know what look at this if I say well let's just take dyd let's multiply it look like an a let's multiply it by DX the beauty of this notation is that those little pieces do act like something you can cross out something you can simplify so what happens to the duus in this case they're gone this right here is the chain rule what it says is that dydx will be equal to Dy * D DX this is changing that's the chain okay so how do we use it in practice let's let's apply it to this scenario okay so when I ask you for DDX of 3x^2 - 4 to the 100th power who cares where you got that from can you do the derivative here's what it says it says take your dyd take your dyd that's this yeah I'll that way take your dyd times your D DX in our case that's the derivative with respect to U of U to the 100 that's where we got this right derivative with respect to U of U 100 are you seeing where that's coming from then it says times the derivative of the inside the 3x^2 - 4 that's the DX do you see that D ydu is this thing it's the derivative of your your function with respect to U that's what this part is are you okay with that the D DX that's the Der of what you call U the derivative of what you call U is the inside part if we take that derivative it says multiply dyd * D DX so take the derivative of the overlying function multiply by the derivative of the inside function that's that's what this says to do uh what was this again times what was that again do you see a problem with this yeah we have x's and we have 's we want which one what X's do you know how much U is equal to sure that's why you had this over here so if we can do that substitution we go okay the X looks great to me but the U doesn't look so great I want to make that U Back Into What U equals so let's do that we'll get 100 3x^2 - 4 because that's our U to what power don't forget about the 99th power don't forget about the exponent time 6X now you could make it a little bit prettier but I want to come back to this and talk about this for a second okay because I want you to see the practicality of the chain rule uh firstly what are you going to do with this this you're going to do something with this what are you going to do with this 6X multiply by what number yeah do that okay don't leave it hanging out there as a Time 6X at the end now naturally please don't please don't do this don't distribute the 100 okay you can't do that because that's an exponent that says in order to distribute the 100 you'd have to foil that out 99 times do you get it please for heaven's sakes don't do that all right don't do that just multiply this number times this number and we get 600x 3x^2 - 4 all to the 9 power that's it that's a pretty easy way to do a derivative is't it not too bad now let's look at what actually happens here because I want you to see this this is going to be in general what we did is there a way that you can get from here to at least well actually probably this step we can get almost from here to here in one step without showing a u without showing a a d DX and a Dy du without showing that stuff I want you to think about what we're doing do you see what happens to the 100 what happens to the 100 power yeah that's basically just your power rule do you see it the 100 comes down to the front you leave this thing alone right that's in the parentheses it says you leave it alone why do you leave it alone because you end up substituting back in the U that's why because with the composition you're going to get that U Back Again do you see that you're going to have some U here you're going to get that so we have a U Back Again that means you don't change inside where's this piece come from where's the 6X come from yeah and this is called the general power rule it's a Cory of the chain rule the chain rule is the overarching idea but what we can do often times with this is something called the general power rule and it says the power rule Works in general if you do this and I'm going to show it to you right now so general power rule so when you ask me well wait I thought you said there's only three rules there there really are there's only the product rule the quotient Rule and the chain rule however the general power rule is like a little piece of the chain rule okay you get the general power rule from the chain rule do you understand so the general power rule says what if you need to take a derivative of some function to some power what if you need need to take the derivative of some function of some power here's how you do it this is called the chain Rule and here's how you do the chain rule I can show it to you if you really want me to this is what would happen you'd say okay what's my what's my function you'd say y equals U to the N true where U would equal f ofx Do you believe me you follow still that's what the chain rule would say well this says okay if I took the derivative of U to the N remember your power rule power rule says you bring down the exponent you subtract one from it true this would say Okay Dy d du would equal n u the nus1 follow me so far du DX would be the derivative of of f ofx that's oh how do I want to write it I'll just say this the derivative of f ofx you could write frime of X you could write that as well are you guys okay that the derivative of U n is n u nus1 and the derivative of FX is the derivative of FX does that make sense to you i' write this way so we have a formula in just a second do you see the chain rule it work we have dyd we have du DX so in order to find dydx we'll have Dy du time du DX well what that says is do a substitution that's n U nus1 times the derivative of your function from the inside how much is U what's U equal to because we did that composition what was u in our case so do that substitution back into there and what you end up getting is n f ofx to the N minus one DDX of f ofx now did we say anything about F ofx at all do we make any qualifications about F ofx so then this should work in general right anytime we have a function raised to some power we could use the chain rule on every single time we led to a formula I just invented this formula for you did you guys see it it's kind of cool right invented the formula for you we we did a composition we can do that we took the derivative here we took the derivative here we know that to get dydx we multiply those two things then we just do our substitution back in for you what that says is if you want to take the derivative of some expression raised to some power all you've got to do is take the derivative of the expression times the derivative of the inside that's what you're doing uh bring down the exponent as usual then multiply by the derivative of the inside that's what the says it in English look look what it says bring down the exponent as usual bring down the exponent as usual then multiply by the derivative of the inside inside that's what that says to do ra have to feel okay with that so do you have to to show me all this to do it no I just proved it for you this this is kind of a proof for you to be able to do that you get it so in English if you want to hear this in English bring down the exponent as usual as you normally do for the power rule that's why it's called the general power rule so bring down the exponent like it's a power rule just multiply by the derivative of the inside you just can't forget about the derivative of the inside cuz this thing matters for sure if you don't have the 6X here does it affect your problem yes oh heck yeah yeah by long shot okay so that does matter bring down exponent and multiply by derivative of the inside would you like a couple examples to kind of work through this and then after that I'll show you some more applications of the chain rule stuff that we can do with some trigonometry which I know you're going to love right uh stuff you can do with that that you can't forget that you need to do with that I'll show you how to work with the chain Rule and then after that uh we'll talk about implicit differentiation if there's a little bit of time okay so let's address this problem if I want you to find the ydx which is what I want you to find could I just do this could I just take the derivative of this and this and this and leave it to the fourth power the answer is no no because this is a composition do you guys see the composition this you could cover the whole thing up and call it U or sorry call it yeah call it U to the 4th why would equal U to the 4th and U would equal this stuff does that make sense to you we could do the chain rule here does this fall into the category of general power rule is it some function raised to two an exponent that's what we're looking for do you guys see the power rule in it how we get the power rule that says here's what we're going to do we're going to do the power rule just like we normally would we'll bring down the exponent we'll subtract one from it just don't forget to multiply by the derivative of the inside so you tell me what to do now that we've talked about it what do I do bring down four good four goes down do I still have an expression here yes what's going to be on the inside of my expression do I change this at all from here to here no that's because that's the U right and you're going to be substituting back in for the U ultimately at the very end of any problem so that inside that's not going to change that's this look at see how we still have a u and we substitute back in the original function to that that's the original function here you're still going to have that so far so good wait a minute right now this is so far so good no what's wrong don't you know what the biggest mistake have people do this they bring down exponent and they forget to subtract from it it's derivatives are not that hard right doing the general power rule you know you're supposed to bring it down subtract people always forget the exponent don't forget the exponent so we do bring it down sure but that four that was a exponent of four we subtract one from it we're going to get three is that okay is are we done now we're good though we bring down the expon we subtract one from it and now you get to do this part the derivative of whatever the inside is the f ofx is the inside of your general power rule it says do this do the power rule no problem leave that alone and then multiply by the derivative of whatever was inside Let's see we got four got the same same thing notice how the calculus is done do you see how what I mean by follow the DDX do you see what I mean by that it's all about where the DDX is that's what your Calculus is so here this is staying the same the only thing we got to worry about is that over there what is it if I leave it just like this am I going to Mark points off from you absolutely why I need to have the parenthesis firstly that says I'm multiplying the whole entire expression now you got a couple choices you can move this thing out front and you can distribute that for into there if you'd like just make sure you have parentheses around it if you do it does that make sense so that you might see a problem end like this you might see a problem end like this or you might see the problem end like this just make sure you have parentheses there or otherwise yeah I'm going to Mark you off because that's a different statement now your question is which one do you want Mr Leonard and I go as long as you need to hear I'm happy with your Calculus now I want one of these two I want one of those two out of you what I can't have you do don't keep going okay there's no way you should ever foil this into the actually be foil oil right outside ins but you should never do that because that's to the third power you can't break the order operations exponents come before distribution or multiplication does okay so you can't break this rule but this is this would be perfectly appropriate how do you feel okay with this so far are you ready to see that we've been doing this literally the entire time with our power rule see general means encompasses all right so check this out if I give you X to 6 just a simple example and I say why don't you take the derivative of x to the 6 you know when that that is 6 x 5th right okay inherently actually wasn't inherent I guess cuz I taught it to you but you know it nonetheless but if you applied if you applied the the general power rule of this check it out if you said oh well that's a function in terms of X I write a little better so you can really see it I said that's a function in terms of X could you do the general power rule to the answer is yeah you could check it out you would do the six x 2 the fth remember that would be in parentheses right because that's your function times the derivative of whatever's inside only this time the inside is X what's the derivative of x that's why we didn't have to show that because the derivative of the inside is always the same thing it's always just X do you get it we've been doing the general power rule we've been doing the chain rule the whole time it just it was simpler because we didn't have that inside so that would become one and you get 6 x 5th interesting we've been doing that's why it's called the general power rule and we had the power rule before you ready to keep going yes okay let's try a few more we're going to start building on this idea [Music] though give me two ways to do that problem dist distribution it's one of them give me another way you have two ways to do this problem right as soon as I do this do you still want to distribute No in fact if they gave that to you before that would be how you had to do that right cuz there was no way to get rid of that three for you without foiling that all out and then Distributing it or foiling at least this out and then using product rule in fact maybe you had to do that on a couple of your examples and it's like darn exponents but now let's look at this for for what it is this is a derivative can you see a product rule in it still can you see a general power rule in it right now yes question is which one comes first well half of you are right which happens the question that's the that's the question uh which one working from the outside in which one encompasses more of the problem you should be able to say this you should be able to say this whole thing has to do with does the whole thing have to do with the general power rule which means is that exponent of three applied to the whole thing right now then that does not come first is the product rule applied to the whole thing right now then that comes first does that make sense to you it' be the same as this question which one would come first a general power rule or a quotient rule what do you think definitely a yeah the general power rule is only applied to this little top part right it doesn't Encompass the whole problem the quotient rule encompasses the whole problem that would come first work from the outside inside now if I did this you'd hate me first off which would come first in this case chain rule chain rule in our specific case this would be you can say CH chain rule that's fine this would also be called the general power rule do you see it general power rule and then you would do the quotient rule then general power and then general power rule inside of that yeah okay that would be nasty one way that you could make this easier if you're looking at it uh you could take both the this exponent say okay this is now to the 10th and that's to the fifth that might make it actually a little bit easier but starting out you would see the Gen this I'm just making a point here you'd see the general power rule first do you see what I'm talking about you see the product rule first here it encompasses the whole problem and that's how you diagnose these things what do you do first whatever is encompassing the whole problem and then you work your way inside and you follow the DDX and the DDX will tell you what to do are you ready to do this problem let's do it so first thing we see okay connecting this thing is a multiplication that means a product rule set up the product rule so [Music] for so now this one the cube root of that is going to stay in with that function just do the product rule right now and we'll talk about the next part later just do the product rule and set it up don't take the derivatives yet to set up the product pool okay set up the product pool I want you to take no don't do the derivative just set up the product rule the product rule should say the derivative of the first time the second plus the first time the derivative second did you all were we all able to do that so this is what I mean by that the derivative the derivative of the first times the second is that the second no okay that's the second yes that three has to tag along with that piece if you're going to do the product rule where have you got that far so far okay good deal you have the exponent right then you do a plus and you do der first * second plus the first times the derivative of the second do you yes for us here's what it said this was the first function X and this was the second function X it was being multiplied right so you have to take those two just those two pieces that's what you were doing here I'm kind of crooked aren't I I'm always like that I think now we feel all right with this so far I'll try to be more straight on the next one now you follow the DDX and you just do what it tells you to do cuz that's your Calculus so just take derivatives piece by piece as they appear so piece by piece as they appear says can you take the derivative of this thing right there yes that's actually quite an easy one what's the derivative of that so this says all right two do I take the derivative of that Heavens no no it has no DDX do I take the derivative of this so I just write it and now we get down to this this piece notice how it's basically the pro R lets you break it up as problems within problems within problems none of it's going to get any harder than this it's just you might have more rules encompassing it so if you can follow the rules down you know the three rules uh the chain rule quotient rule product rule you know how to go from the outside inside just follow your DDX you'll be okay now that's easier said than done or I know some of these problems are very tasking but if you can do that that's the fundamentals here you look from the outside inside start with the big rules and follow the DDX and then use rules within rules within rules so on this one we look at this and you say can I do that piece that derivative it's basically a problem within a problem what's the derivative of x^2 - 5 3r what rule do you need for that chain rule or the cor to that because this is a specific version of the chain rule is called the what general power rule so this was a product rule and inside of that had a general power rule general power rule says well what I'm going to do is so for this piece for this piece what do I do so notice I'm here right now I bring down the three very good what do I have next please good I don't change the inside I don't change that to the what exponent oh don't forget that and then I'm done right okay times the derivative of the inside that's the chain rule that is the general power rule times the derivative and I want you to write it out I want to see this I don't want you doing the math in your head right now we're just learn we're just barely learning it okay I know that eventually some of you are going to be able to just do these in your head in this class for right now wait till you get to 4B to do that for right now I want to see your work that way if you make a mistake not saying you will but if you do I want to see where that's happening do you get me do you get me show me those steps okay uh times a derivative of x^2 - 5 remember that we're multiplying here are there any other ddxs to take care of hm yeah okay oh so yes we do we have a DDX what's the derivative of this little piece so if you follow that DDX down that tells you where to take the derivative of or what to take the derivative of so we're basically all done up until that point we have 2 x^2 - 5 3r let's not mess up any exponents 2x - 3 * 3 X - 5 to 2 time what is the derivative of that little piece notice how we kind of eliminated some of the bigger rules right about we use product rule that helped us down to just have one more rule left we had general power rule now we have just a very simple power rule and we're do together ra I feel okay with this so far your calcul this is over with now we're going to make it prettier by using a little bit of algebra and you're going to see something that happens often when you have have a product rule that involves a general power rule you're going to see some pieces that keep reappearing see how that thing appeared again with our product rule cuz you had the original and then you took a general power rule where that piece shows up again A lot of times that happens when you do the product rule and you have a general power rule you're going to want to factor that at the end it makes things a lot nicer so I'll show you what I'm talking about if we go ahead maybe make this just a little bit prettier we have this this becomes 6X like that are you okay with that so far yes no do you see the factorization what I'm talking about yeah we have this this big factor and this big factor right there we can pull out what can we pull out of that if I pull out the x^2 - 5^ 2 what I end with is two two still there x^2 - 5 to what power good because I pull out two of those things does that make sense to you plus 6X 2x - 3 are are there any of these left I factored that out notice you can get the same thing if you distributed this distributes and give you this this distributes and give you that so that that's factorization right there we feel with that so far the next thing you do distribute this in combine like terms if you distribute this in combine like terms you'll have a much simpler looking polom so in here we get our 2x^2 - 10 we get our 12 x^2 - 18x if I did it right did I do it right yeah if we combine some of those like terms I'm seeing 14 x^2 I'm seeing - 18x - 10 now hopefully it's not just me but this thing looks a whole lot more concise than that thing does it not it looks it looks prettier looks better looks more concise we're wrapped up and that's where we want to end our derivatives if we can make it that far show H how many people feel okay with what we we've done so far at least up to the calculus being done part are you okay with the calculus being done part after that just algebra manipulation that's okay we do that by the way this is the part where people lose track in this class what you're actually doing okay they just get to the they go oh yeah general rule and pro Rule and P rule train rule they lose track of what you're doing what did we just do we found the what slope found that's all we're doing to find the slope this is the slope this is the formula for the slope of that curve at any point that I want so could I still find that equation of a tangent line at a point sure I'd plug in the x coordinate to here to find my slope I'd plug my x coordinate into here to find my point then use y - y1 = MX - X1 that's all we're doing okay we're finding slope or if this is a position curve we're finding velocity or rate of change or if it's cost function we're finding uh marginal cost marginal profit things like that very interesting stuff let's try a few more I need to show you how the uh the chain is going to affect something to do with like a trig function and that will probably be about our day does the chain Rule still apply what do you think do I have a function within a function basically that's what you're asking because if if you do then you have a chain rule do I have a general power rule here oh explain that explain how I have a general power rule because I don't see an exponent right now so in order to do this well hopefully you remember this from the last couple sections in order to do the the derivative you really need to represent Roots as exponents right because we know we we deal with that we subtract one from them you can't subtract one from a square root unless you write it as a 1/2 so first thing to do is go yeah all right I know that this is 5x^2 - 1 in parentheses to the 1/2 power and that right there says aha aha look if you can cover it up you're talking about a composition within within parentheses you're talking about a composition that means chain rule applies in this case it's an exponent so the general power rule applies why don't you go ahead and try it go for it you're you're at that point at this at this stage remember I really don't want you doing the work all in your head I want to see the steps right now I want to see the DDX written out did you make it that far one 5x^2 - 1 to the2 cool inside doesn't change for now and then we take the derivative of the function itself the inside function our composition or the piece of our composition if we take that derivative then we're just about done did you get the 10 X2 how many got exactly that on our paper good for you now make it a little prettier here's how you can make it a little prettier the 1/2 and the 10 that simplifies that simplifies and gives you five so we have 5x and then we have this 5x^2 - 1 the2 how you can write that appropriately would be since you started as a square root you probably want to end with some sort of root we want 5x on the numerator 5x on the numerator 5x^2 - 1 and a square root on the denominator you see where why it's on the denominator firstly that negative 1/2 that moves to the denominator the 1/2 becomes positive that's a square root can I cross out the 5x and the 5x s oh heck no no no no no we can't do that all right I see that all day long andree but no we can't do that are you ready to move on from the general power rule because that's about all I can show you with that I mean it doesn't change after this if you can do these couple problems you're you're okay so far are you okay so far would leaving in an exponential form still be acceptable if it's given to you that way what I'm expecting most of the time is is I if I give it to you as exponents exponents are fine if I give it to you as roots change it back to roots can you do that derivative that would be what folks oh very good you're memorizing it fantastic can you do that derivative the answer is no not with what you know well actually yes because we just talked about chain but not what you knew before today the answer would be no but let's look at it do you have a composition going on in this which means can you cover up a piece of it and get some other function basically if I cover this part up if I say cover up the inside we're always talking about covering up the inside cover up the inside and say well let's let y equal cosine of U and U equals whatever's into my hand would that be an appropriate composition because if I let the U go in for U in fact x to the 4th go for U then I get that back again right well if we find our Dy du what's Dy du here ladies and gentlemen we just talked about it negative sign What U negative sign U and DX what's DX and we knew that Dy DX is dy du times du DX true true St this is sin U because that's dyd that's this time DX which is 4X Cub dyd D DX dyd * DX that's chain rule we just talked about that that's this right here what's the one last thing I need to do SUB why why do I need to substitute different don't want to end with us and X's we'll make it prettier but that's the one I want to talk about this will ultimately become -4x Cub s of X 4th that would be the derivative of that curve are you okay with how to do that we that 4X cub front notice what you can't do oh please goodness don't do this please don't please please don't ever multiply those that's an angle this is not this you cannot make 4X to the 7th if you do that I I'm going to burn your paper I burn it gone what homework I didn't see any homework from you I was just burn it CU it's embarrassment I want you do that just kidding I wouldn't burn it but I will go no with like five exclamation points underline it and scribble on it and stomp on it that's about it kick a puppy I'm not going to kick a puppy not that not that bad but are you okay with this here's what this says in English we'll stop here this says in order to do the chain rule with this type of thing you really don't need to show me this this is just the underlying word here's what it says in English well and a little bit a little bit of calculus it says if you want to take the derivative of a composition the derivative of a composition such as we just had right now here's what this said to do it says I want you to take the derivative look what it does please says take the derivative of cosine right what's the derivative of cosine negative negative sign and leave the inside alone does that look familiar that's exactly what with general power rle right there take the derivative of the outside function the the cosine in this case but then you just can't forget to multiply by the derivative of whatever the inside was and that's what this says take the derivative the inside and multiply it that's what we did with general power rule a lot of people do this they will give me they give me this all day long oh it kills me they say oh yeah answer is negative sign of uh 4X Cub I get that all day long see the common mistake that people would make to get that they go oh yeah der of cosine sign der of the inside 4X Cub is this right no because they have not applied the chain rule chain rule says you have a composition here you need to take the derivative of your function sure leave the inside alone then multiply by the derivative inside so this says you take I'm going to use a kind of combination of rules here or U sorry notation you take frime of X I'm sorry frime of G of x times G G Prim of X that's what you do derivative of the outside leave the inside alone times the derivative the inside and that's exactly do you see that over here do you see what that means for us here okay good derivative of the function times the derivative of the inside that's what we're doing how many people feel okay about what we talked about so far will start here next time with a couple more chain rules and then we'll keep on moving thing right so uh today we are practicing all we are practicing today is applications of the three rules that we talked about chain rule which includes general power rule the product rule the push rule that that's pretty much it uh what you know from the chain rule is this this says in English you take the derivative of the function leaving the inside alone and you multiply by the derivative of the inside if you can remember that for the chain rule you're good to go we'll start simply then I'm going to start building on some nasty looking problems oh my gosh and they'll take us maybe the whole board to do uh but you need to see them because your homework's going to be like that too okay I don't want to leave you hanging on on this stuff so we're going to do examples we're going to do examples pretty much all [Music] day okay s of 4X to 5th uh a couple questions for you first thing is this a product rule okay so product rues apply because this is a actually a function this is really a composition you know a lot of people really don't understand trigonometry they go oh yeah it's sign time 4X 4X 5th which is not really what we're doing right you can't take if I just give you sign that's meaningless that doesn't mean sign that means a sin right now if I give you sign with an angle that means sign okay I'm not going to write sin on your paper you're not going to write sin if you write sin without this you're sinning in math that you're sinning right you have to have this part you have to have something with it if you just have this that right that that's not signed by itself is meaningless it must have something to it so this is not a product rule what this is is a composition of two functions a composition of 4X 5th in the sign what that means whenever you see a composition as a chain rule will work if you can cover up a piece of it and you still have a function that means it's a chain rule you okay with that that's chain rule right there so if we use the chain rule the chain rule says this says in order to find dydx you're going to take the derivative of the function yes but you're going to at first leave the inside of it alone so what's the derivative everybody of s so we do the cosine yes do we take the derivative of 4X 5th right here that's going to stay alone that's that's this part okay that's the G of X that says 4X 5th this says you don't even change G of X and we didn't change G of x times ah the derivative of G ofx that's where you get the derivative of inside you don't match it all together you don't take this derivative and the derivative and put it right here that's not what you do this shouldn't be cosine of 20x to 4th that's not it you take this derivative later and you multiply it and I want to see it written out 4X 5th like that and then you take the derivative what's the derivative of 4X to the 5th that's where we're getting that from so we're going to have a 20 x 4th time cosine don't even need that times of 4X 5th that right there that's our derivative that was a chain rule so on the test you want to see bdx I absolutely want to see that okay the way I'm showing you things in class is the way I want to see them on your test because I'm going to grade each little part I'm look for this I'm going look for this right there's only two steps don't get lazy and not show me your steps you okay with that one yeah that's a pretty basic one we're going to start building them up now I'm going to start incorporating more and more rules so you can start seeing them you ready for it yeah yeah let's do this you know a really good note to write down here or at least think about you want to think about the rules that you're going to have to do before you start your problem uh mostly you think about the most encompassing rule here so when you look at this problem what does this actually mean what is the cosine 2 x 4 write it like that give yourself a chance of this problem instead of just leaving it like this maybe you write it as cosine X 4th squared that's what it really actually means there doesn't it we just take a shortcut and put that square there often times you okay with that so far now let's think start with our rules which rule encompasses the whole problem is it a chain rule is it a general power rule I see two of them right now what I'm going to use a specific I know they're both chain rows all right so we're going to be more specific than that which one is should we do first this part or should we deal with the two first two the two and what does that two say to do general power that's the general power rule now it is a chain rule but it's a specific chain rule it's like a correlated chain rule it's called the general power rule so what this says is I have if you can cover it up remember that it's a chain rule it's a specific chain rule because it has a power it says general power rule general power and then inside of that you're probably going to have a chain rule do you see the chain rule as well if we start with the the largest rule I'll say the largest because it's the one that comes as everything you start with that then you can follow your DDX but it's all about how you start you got to think about that first you with me so let's go ahead and do our our DDX uh what happens to this thing what are we going to do so this two down goes out front all right and I'm going to have what what's next come on tell tell me does this change for my general power rule so I'm still going to have a cosine x 4 uh to what power so do I need a bracket with a little one is this okay on how to get this and then I'm done now what x of just x to the 4 what's the derivative that should come next remember when you do a general power rule you cover the whole thing up right you go okay take the derivative of what's under my hand it says you move the two down you subtract one from it that's great and you don't change what's under my hand that's this part but then you have to take the derivative of everything that's under my hand do you get me so it's not just x to the fourth it's what the whole thing oh this is going to be brutal no no no not brutal fun tonight yes tonight re have you're okay with that so far you see where you you see why you have a cosine there you see why you have a coine there this one you do not change this one you take the derivative of the entire inside function that's how the general power rule AKA The Chain rule Works derivative of the function times the derivative of the inside but now you're done with the calculus up to this point now you follow your DDX and this has broken down your problem made a little bit easier can you take the derivative of cine x to the 4th what rule is that that's the chain rule the chain rule says you take the derivative of your function times the derivative of your inside that's what it says to do the derivative of your function times dtive inside so you tell me does any of this change okay times we'll take the derivative of cosine X 4th what's the derivative of cosine x 4 let's think about that it says you take the derivative of says derivative of your overlying function okay that's the that's the thing that you're composing into so derivative of cosine you need to take that first what's the derivative of cosine so I'm going to put that in a bracket because it's negative negative hey negative sign of what is it still X 4th or 4X Cub good because chain rule says you do this but you leave this piece alone for just a second you leave that alone in order to find the deriv of this you multiply by that so we're starting to build these rules on top of each other and you really got to be good at what rule comes first if you are then you follow the DDX and it's just fine but you got you got to find that first rule once you do that we said okay this probably should be written like this this says general power rule you bring it down you leave it alone you multiply by the derivative of the inside that's where we're getting that from you okay with that after that calculus done just just keep on writing it keep on writing it this DDX says take the derivative of this thing now this is a chain rule chain rule says I take the derivative of cosine got it but I leave the inside alone just like you left the inside alone here I leave the inside alone and then I multiply by the derivative of the inside that's where that's coming from where you out with that so far good all right we're almost done we only have one little teeny derivative to take what is it yeah you know what every time you do a step it makes it easier sometimes but every time you use a rule it breaks down in little pieces for you times what's that cool Sorry 2 cosine x 4 * sin x 4 * 4X Cub just make it maybe a little prettier up here little prettier would mean you have a negative you've got a 4X cubed and you have a two they're all being multiplied together you see the multiplication take that stuff together so this will be8 negative 8 x to 3r then the cosine or the sign and then the sign and that's how I'd like to see your problem after this is It's just algebra it's just putting a couple things together you have 2 * -1 * 4 that's your coefficient that's 8 the X to the third we typically like to bring that up front can you follow that yes no if yes great if not do you have a question about it guys are we here are we good my middle guys good people at home just kidding can't see you uh you guys on left what if I could see you they' freak you out wouldn't it anyway doesn't matter which order the sign the coine go in no that doesn't matter this is technically right right this is it so no matter how you because multiplication is commutative associative doesn't matter how you group up how you put in order we typically just write numbers and single variables first and then signs and cosiness it's just how we do it can we move on are you ready to move on to one similar Choice guess you just leave you're going to stay no no choice okay okay this is actually kind of a more friendly problem a little bit do you see why it's a more friendly of a problem if I had done this would it be a friendly problem no that would be your enemy if I did that what would you do first a chain rule they're both chain rules but a chain rule or a general power rule power that would be just very similar to that problem you would have to bring down the four all this to the third power derivative of the entire inside thing do you see it without the power without the power what are we talking about here CH that's the chain R just see the if you can cover something up and you still have a function that's typically a chain rule so we still have a chain rule right here it's not product rule that's not a product it's tangent of something that's a chain rule it's composition well let's do it what's how's the chain rule work what should we do first please I do what now Okay cool so leave this alone take the dtive of that thing so this says I'm G to oh tan what's tan very good Mak some flash cards know those derivatives secant squar does the inside change for us right now okay done no Noti can you tell me what the inside is here is it tan of this or just this just that part this is just a chain R it says derivative of tan see squ leave the inside alone then multiply by the derivative of inside that's what the chain says to do in English got it see squ cool inside doesn't change derivative of the inside that's the chain will it work not too bad what are we going to do take the just follow the DDX this is basically done you're going to get a secant squared but where people often forget to what people often forget to do is this piece of it they really often forget to do the chain rule they'll do this for me but they'll forget this part I can't have you forget that part that's a big part that's a really big part or they will do secant squar and then they'll take the derivative and just mash it together so if you're giving me this well that's that's not even nearly right you've changed the angle you you've messed that problem up all right that's not what we're talking about you can't just take derivative of this and D of that this is definitely a chain rule because it is a composition see the difference there okay so for us we go no no no no not that this is what is it oh yeah I just wrote it another question can I distribute that yes why can't you what is that it's an angle that's an angle It's actually an angle that's related to this oh no no no not this I mean this I thought you me dist these two can you distribute these two no negatory no no no this that's that's not an angle this is attached to that secant Square okay that's part of it you can't change the angle you can't change the angle what we can do is move this to the front so we don't distribute it um You probably wouldn't want to take this thing in and take the whole thing you wouldn't want to do that it's already factored for you nicely don't do that just leave it as 6 x - 2^ 2 3x^2 - 2x tell me one huge thing I'm going to Mark you off on for sure yeah for sure still okay yes all right ready keep going could we also put that one parentheses right yeah like that like that yeah you could it would be irrelevant but you could just keep EAS okay see now we're having fun no you know what I'll be no I'm not going to be nice um there great way to say thank okay I was just going to give you an X but I want you to see what happens so this will be a little bit more diff trust me you want the more difficult ones now that way your homework seems easier if I just gave you all the easy ones now your homework should seem like a bear so you want to do that okay I'm lost what do I do why why would you say a general power rule okay so chain chain rule general power same thing but we're going to say general power rule when we have the exponent so we can classify this a little bit better in our heads okay so if I say chain rule right now me I'm looking here I'm looking there so this I'm going to call that a general power rule for this class okie dokie do you see the general power rule at work see how it covers the whole entire expression so perhaps write it this way because we know in order to take these derivatives we've got to have exponent so far so good am I oh I amoot better much more better okay tell me what to do come on you guys should be rolling with this stuff at this point this should be like okay we're getting there not perfect but we're getting there what do we do good cuz this is general power rule right general power rule says bring it down write whatever's on the inside notice how we're not changing that the inside does not change for our chain rule which also includes a general power rule uh do I still have an exponent or do I just get get rid of that exponent do I still have an exponent here don't forget about that exponent man oh my gosh if you just move move down one2 you forget that that's a big deal because you've eliminated a square root on a denominator there so this this really needs that negative2 do you see where the negative one2 is coming from yes can if you do you feel okay with it now what do I do take that to R yeah take the d of the inside take the derivative inside so general power rule says bring it down subtract one just like you normally would with any power rule only now you have to multiply by the derivative of whatever you covered up whatever you ignored for a second in this case it's the entire expression so notice how before you start taking all these derivatives you have the same thing twice you see that same thing twice and then you I'm losing some of you you with me then you take the deriv of that little piece this calculus done just hang on to it for a while now let's look at the derivative of this nasty junk here what is the derivative of this thing can you take it a derivative piece by piece no is it okay when I'm adding subtracting do I need a Special Rule to take the derivative of x Cub not at all I can just do what's the derivative of x Cub beautiful so don't outthink these problems the only time you need special rules in when you have a quotient a product or a chain rule that's it so when you get this little piece this should be a problem within a problem now you look at this you go how do I take the derivative of x Cub no problem it's being added remember derivatives are separable by addition subtraction that's okay so I just take this and go oh yeah yeah yeah I do 3x2 not a problem that's fine can I take the derivative of cosecant X cubed can I take it directly or do I need a special rule for it do you see the chain rule here chain rule says sure it is cosecant but if there's something special in there besides an X that means a chain because that's a composition just like this one was just like oh what one just like that one was just like that this one was that's a composition you need a chain rule there if you just give me the derivative of cosec with X Cub or the derivative of cose with 3 3 x^2 you're not hitting the money on this class right you're missing the chain rule you're be missing some factors of X you miss a whole lot of stuff here so this is great sure now let's take the derivative of cose x Cub what's the Dera the train rule says take the derivative of cosecant so what's the derivative of cosecant let me change it to a bracket too negative cosecant coent of of what good because this says with chain rule you take this derivative great I just do that but you leave the inside alone for now would that be or is is it okay to leave oh yeah sorry did I forget oh I did forget that shoot I knew something looked funny thank you so this says when you do this cosecant is cosecant Cent so cosecant X was cose xent x what our X is is x 3r in this case so we go okay x 3 x the 3 now what what's the inside sure it looks ridiculous yeah I know that but can you do it do you see where it's all coming from how it's all fitting together is is it really really all that bad not really it's just you got to be careful really careful I mean the only the probably the hardest thing is memorizing cose you go hard thing here is D of cose NE cose Cent hopefully that's right is that right check your notes okay right CU here well general power rule sure we got that down calculus is done here derivative of this one's very easy 3x^2 D of this one that's chain rule this is negative cosecant Cent you do not change the inside you multiply by the derivative of the inside that's going to be 3x2 that's where we're getting 3x2 are you with me on this so far let's see if I have room for this stuff go right here SO2 all this to thetive one2 3x2 negative cose coent and lastly we have that little piece 3x2 hope that fit I think so sure now the 3x2 is that going to get multiplied with both of those terms the X plus you mean here and here right or it just with this right here ends a parentheses right there so that 3x2 this 3x^2 is not associated with the X Cub right so this does not get distributed to here this right here is 3x^2 plus this entire nasty looking expression okay that's what that is so when we try to simplify this just a little bit let's look what happens we're going to get 12 XB + c x Cub to the2 we're going to get a big bracket 3x2 doesn't change you don't distribute to that that was just a standalone small derivative 3x2 this we're going to pretty this up a little bit positive negative plus what's that going to be minus I'm going to move the 3x2 out front so this will be minus 3x^2 cose X Cub cang X cub and that's your grip that's pretty nasty can you follow it yes or no yeah or like there's no simply way can you would it be correct if you if you would go 3x^2 - 3 x^2 cose x Cub X Cub over sure I'm going to show you that right now so if you do want to put this back into this format this would be I mean like do you want us to or can we just leave it as that at this point it could go either way if I give it to you as a root probably make it back as a root it's generally the idea give it to his exponents leave to exponents um also one more thing if some of you guys want to get fancy with this and factor out 3x^2 you'd have 3x^2 * parentheses 1 minus that uh sometimes identities will help with that sometimes you can do identities a lot of one minus stuff when you have squares happens uh this thing I don't know if you can simp simplify that anymore or not um I because I made stuff pop my head but what you could do one last final thing would be [Music] this if you made it there if you can make it there that's fine for me that's great so we did General power rule we got it here's inside not changing derivative of the inside got it we're going to do 3x2 der this is a chain rule chain rule says cose xent X so we leave that inside Alone multipli by the derivative of the inside and then after that it's a little bit of simplification feel okay with this problem sure they're nasty yeah I get it they don't look fine but they're useful what did you just find yeah slope all this means is M slope M M for this I think I hate to be dealing with that gra oh yeah I don't even know what that looks like not a clue a little bit probably all squiggly lines all over the place don't know don't really care honestly you ready to keep going two more two more what you want to do first you want to do the hard one the harder one hard you want do the harder one yeah all right you asked for it we have three more actually last I that's not a good sign nope notice one thing please uh I could give this to you with a slightly different look check this out if I gave it to you like this would you verify that that's exactly the same thing you probably if unless you have a function of X up there probably shouldn't use quotient rule here if you use quotient rule this it's going to explode in your face paper no done it's not going to handle this problem need a special paper for that they don't sell in stores uh no do this okay unless you have a function of X CU you don't want to deal with that either if you had a function of X and you move this up top of you're talking about product rule you do that it's fine but that's just a constant move that up for me would you that and that way you just use a general power rule instead of a quotient rule quotient rule with this be ridiculous so verify that's the same then you can start looking at it so we're going to identify what we're doing on this problem I need you to see the pieces what's the biggest piece General power very good general power rule encompasses this whole entire problem now let's let's walk all the way through it within the general power rule after we do that we're going to come down to these two things right yeah what's the derivative of three Z that's great so we we'll be able to do that one nice and easy how about this piece what encompasses this just this is it product or chain product product encompasses the whole thing doesn't it yeah now within the product rule I'll take a derivative of x that's that's easy 2X and then I'll have to take a derivative of this little piece right here what what is this little piece that's a chain rule so we're doing general power rule we will have a project rule within that we'll have a chain rule within that okay it's nice to think about those things though nice to think of it just kind have like a a graphic organizer or an organizer for advanced organizer for your thoughts ready yeah two more yeah yeah but they're easier sort of sort of let's get to it come on you tell me what to do what am I going to do now good keep everything the same yeah negative -2 right you know how many mistakes I saw on your homework with that be careful I mean it would be so sucky if you knew how to do this stuff and you gave me -2 here right that would suck cuz I'm like oh you know what you're doing G no I don't do that it's four4 subtract one from that and then what now um now we multiply by thetive of the inside write that out go for the derivative the inside right now when we say the inside we mean the entire expression that you basically ignored so you should have that on your paper do you have that on your paper yes hey calculus is done here you're done with that we're just working on this piece over here let's take the derivative of this piece over here so this is -3 X2 Cent X2 all right -4 you're done with that piece times probably want a bracket you need a bracket big bracket lost St big bracket why big bracket well let's look at that uh derivative of three oh that's nice that's a nice one if it was just another expression we could have taken a simple derivative just like we did right here right right there so no problem this is zero I'm not even going to write the Zero D 3 is zero it's constant let's F focus on this one you said what happens here which is why we need a bracket because I'm sorry noct which is why we need a bracket because we're going to have an addition in there product means plus you follow so we need that bracket to organize that this says okay I'm going to have three's gone that was a zero so this goes to zero this says the derivative of the first times a second are you seeing how all the rules are coming back to haunt us or help us how you want to look at it uh plus or minus folks plus what finish this off you got to say it okay so X I'm going to do X squ first how I I like to do it derivative of cang x s finish off your bracket okay kot if you can head notot if you can follow that yes okay cool follow our ddxs here no ddxs here DDX here DDX -3 3 + x^2 Cent X2 to the -4 power big bracket derivative of x s everybody what is that well that's nice 2X Cent x^2 well we got that done plus I don't take the derivative of this X2 I simply follow my DDX x^2 tell me what happens here please what happens here what happens now I chain R for sure that's a chain rule do you guys see the chain rule absolutely chain rule we predicted it right we had general power rule product rule chain rule so we had that right let's go ahead let's do follow the DDX do that chain rule chain rule says here I'm probably going to have at least a parentheses to organize my thoughts a little bit you don't necessarily need it here because it's just a chain rule you're not adding or subtracting but it's kind of nice to have what happens with with that what's the derivative of coent is itose so I'd like it in parenthesis just because I know that's a negative I don't want to cons uh misconstrue that as a minus sign that's the only reason I have it here so negative cose squ of oh of what folks of what 2X or x s good and then we're done right oh there's one thing if you forget this oh it blows your whole problem up but if we don't forget it we have the problem right times what yeah I want DDX of X2 this is this parenthesis that's the bracket have five problems on our test I can give you one I can give you one problem and it would show you everything seriously I could I'm not going to but cuz if you got it wrong oh that suckes 20% of your grade suckers no I would't do that to you I might do that to you if I retiring just don't care anymore you no I would do that that' be worse than kicking no about the same level he kicking a puppy Okay so kick the puppy general power the Pu for you D to the inside product rule no problem chain rule we got it derivative inside right here that's going to give you 2X and we're done the calculus oops last step is just to organize this little p p over here and then we're good we're fine also if you wanted to write this on the denominator of a fraction you could all you could do that I'll show that to you as well so we have -3 all this junk this over here since we have all being multiplied together that's a negative that's a 2X and that's an X2 a negative a 2X and x s tell me what I write good again if you really wanted to get fancy you could factor out a 2X here and a 2X here you could do that if you wanted to uh you could distribute the three across this but not that because the exponent uh so one last thing you you might you might write it be all this stuff times the -3 that does not move it's not associated with that negative exponent all over that what we be good just one before it most cases yeah actually it depends on how I gave it to you if I gave it to you like that with that negative exponent like I originally did would be good that's fine right if I gave it to you like one over that I probably would expect you to go back to that so you see the patter pattern in it because if you see the pattern in it uh you can kind of guesstimate what these derivatives will at least look like CU remember how this was one over this to the third and now it's some crap over this to the fourth that fourth power and that doesn't come from nowhere that's still right there you have all this Jun associated with it how many people feel okay with what we talked about so far all right we start one more won't get all the way through it I have a question yeah you factor out the 2x right there yes yeah I was saying that you could factor out the 2X this would become uh 6X this would be cang x^2 this would be- x^2 cose s X2 okay and you could do that if you want to get fancy you know I'm just trying to survive all right two more two more maybe we'll just you know what we'll just talk about them I think you've had enough uh this is this is good enough we I'll put them on the board we'll talk about what they are and then uh you can do them on your own if you want answers to them maybe I'll I'll work them out and and give you answers at the very end of this thing uh just so you can you can see it on the board but for right now here's the problems I'll be doing and then I want to see if you can do them on your own just kidding just kidding that look s horrible do you see how horrible that would be you could do it though couldn't you couldn't you general power general power rule noer rule chain rues that would be that twice in there what's this one what's this one rule comes first yes for sure because that encompasses the whole problem within the quotient rule do you see the chain rules if you forget that that it's going to have a 2X Associated and it's going to have a 2X Associated that's going to affect your problem so quotient rule you write quotient rule first you work it piece by piece you do the chain Ru for each little piece that you come across and then you're done oh all over the bottom Square remember that I'm going to work this out for you uh after class and I'll have this on the video if you want to check your your answer try that one and see it so I will work that out for you the other one is this one I told you they were going to get a little easier a little easier what's this one cuz I I've given this on a test before and I have people give me this all day long 2x cosine 3 and I go I kill you I kill you not thatu Ru product rule First Chain Ru within that do you see it and you can handle that one okay we're going to stop there I'm going to work those out I'll have them posted in just a little while okay so here we go hang on just a second so we have qu rule chain rule here chain rule here derivative of a little piece derivative of a little piece the rest is just simplification this one here's the answer so I'll get out of the way uh pause the video and then look at it Cy that's okay
