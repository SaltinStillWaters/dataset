Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 2.5:   Finding Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions
we're going to talk about dues yay what a good day aren't you guys glad you're here on Friday oh you better learn it you trust me you want to learn this stuff uh triq functions they're going to come back at you again and again and again and again and again and again again math uh 4 B oh yeah that you spend most of your time doing trig even if you're not doing trig you're doing trig trig substitutions all sorts of stuff in 4B here we just get kind of Basics so you're lucky you're lucky but you really need to handle this stuff so that you next class oh you look so depressed so that next class you're you get it you ready I'm going to prove it to you at least so you know where it's coming from would you like to see that yes okay there's two things we need to understand and they all start from here please tell me you know those do you know those pleas pleases what's this one one very good what's this one good if you know those ones I'll prove to you that we can find the derivative of s cosine tangent secant cosecant cotangent those are the our are six that we're going to be working with a lot in this class okay got memorize those derivatives I'm not going to show you all of them I'll show you one of them the other I'll show you sign right now the one for cosine is very similar the one for tangent cosecant secant cotangent can be done with the quotient rule because once you once you have sign you have a lot of it pretty much done you ready for it we'll start today we probably won't finish today but at least I want to get started what we want to do is if f ofx equals sign I want to find fime well here's what we know we know that to take a derivative uh here's why we need limits again we're going to go back to the the uh the concept of a a derivative as being a limit remember that we took a limit as H approach zero of f ofx plus hus F ofx all over H and you thought you'd never have to deal with that again right we're going to deal with it a couple more times to figure out some derivatives that we don't already know and this is one of them we'll get to what this is and what this is and then we'll stop we we'll uh come back to this on Monday but remember how I had to do f of x plus h and f of x in our case here can you verify that f of x would be sin x and F of X+ H would be sin of x + H are you okay with that so far one thing you need to know when we're going through this you can't separate this X Plus H unless we can use a Trea identity and we will use trig identity but you can't just pull that H out or you can't just do sin x plus sin H that doesn't work so we're going to have to use a trig identity I'll show you that later but for right now here's how far we've made it we know that the first derivative will be the limit as H approaches zero sin x + hus sin x over H are you okay getting down to that far folks you see where that's all coming from cool we'll continue the rest of this next time so well we're right in the middle of this proof we're trying to prove the derivative for FX = s of X and what we're doing is using the limit to prove that because well that is a derivative the other stuff we were just kind of shortcutting the derivative so you need to know that this function right there that is the derivative function so we got to use that for most things uh in case we we know it's a polinomial and can finagle it with our product rules or quotient rules that's really how we find most of the derivatives so here we've made it down we know that f ofx is sinx we know that f of x plus h is sign of X plus h in parenthesis we're going to use one trig identity with this and then we're going to try to get these two identities out of it and if we can do that because those are limits then we'll be able to find the derivative so here's our idea as soon as we make it down to S of X Plus H we're going to use the uh addition rule for for sign which says you can split those things up like this you can say this is equal to you can look it up look up that identity on your own if you'd like s of x + H in those es is the same thing as sin x cine h plus cine X sin H so this part right here is the same as this part right here those are the same so I still have a minus sinx all of are you familiar with that identity have you ever seen that before I just can't remember which one it was called it's the addition says you can separate the addition of that angle like this s of x cosine h plus cosine x s of H now I'm just going to Interchange these two things real quick so I can have uh my S of X next to this s of X I'm going to end up probably factoring that actually I'm definitely going to be factoring that out so let's just go ahead and interchange this term with that term so sin x cosine hus sin x and then plus this thing at the very end are you okay with that so far sure so I just reverse those things now notice that this whole thing is over H right which means I can separate each of those top Parts as over H if I really wanted to True make three different fractions what I'm going to choose to do is a unique thing I'm going to make two fractions I'm going to make this one over h plus this one over H and might see y already do you see y already do you see a sin H over H right now anywhere on the right hand side there's a sin H over H we're going to be able to use that on the left hand side we see a sin x and a sin x we're going to be able to factor that out so we're going to factor the sinx out here I'm going to make this look just a little bit different I'm going to do cosine x * sin H H last little thing if you really want it to look identical I'm going to factor out a 1 see how it's cosine hus1 and we have one minus cosine H you see that actually this this is also another identity I think they give that to you in the book as a matter of fact it's the same exact thing if we factor out a negative one from that you could do just to make it look identical this would become a negative sign times if I factor the negative 1 out those will reverse I will get 1us cosine H the cosine will become negative the one will become positive over yes sir are you guys okay with our algebra so far yeah I got lost where where you got the cosine hus one from I have factored out sinx from this term and that term so if I factor out sinx I get H if I factor out sin x I get one factor me division so we're dividing yeah um where does the H how come the over H I mean it's not coine over H in the second one this one yeah 3x/ 2 is the same thing as 3 * x 2 good questions you right with this so far you okay that factor on a negative or reverse two terms good deal see anything that pops up in our problem yeah we see some identities right and because limits are separable we can separate those those limits by addition further by multiplication we can separate limits like that not derivatives but limits and this is now a limit what is the limit of 1 - cine H over H how much is this so negative sign * 0 that's going to give you zero that part gives you zero are you okay with that are you sure you do one more step if you want this is remember okay let let meit make one more thing clear what is going to zero the H or the X the H is going to zero not the X the H so the X's stay the same just like you did with your derivatives remember doing your derivatives of limits your X stay the same so this would be sinx time 0 that's going to give you zero plus what happens to the cosine X does it go to one no cosine X stays the same because it's an X that's not an H cosine X time what's s limit of sin H over H how much is that 0 + cosine X cos x is that interesting no no don't care you're going to Care Co it better be interesting you're going to have to memorize it firstly it says the derivative of s is cosine what's the derivative stand for which is weird right because it says find the slope at any point on sign plug a number into cosine you have the slope on sign that's weird it's kind of unique we proved it though right agreeable to follow the proof so now do we have to do this again no you don't have to do it again you now have the derivative of sign the derivative of sign is cosine is it revers no I'm going to give you all of them right now it's not exactly reversible the derivative of cosine is not s okay it's not s it's close to that but it's not sign I'll give you all those right now I'm not going to show you the proofs the proofs are for cosine are done very similarly okay you do cosine very very much the same as this this uh very similar to this one let's see if I can think you'd still you'd still separate it You' still do your factorization uh but you'd end up with having a negative up front and that's going to be what we get we going to see that in our derivative of cosine right now so derivative of sinx is what folks good so whenever you see that from now on you got it that's it let me give you the rest of them this will be kind of like a memorization table for you you got to know this stuff are there any questions on this uh anymore before we continue right so here we go if you want to take a derivative of s you know it's going to be cosine that's our number one now the derivative of cosine again you can find it doing the same thing that we did turns out that it's not exactly sign it's negative sign negative sign you want to see that coming coming see me I can prove that to you but once you have those ones check out what happens what's Tan x what's tan what I'm sorry not the derivative of it but what is Tan x the identity it's what over what so with a quotient rule you could find Tan x because you'd have S over cosine use a quotient rule work it all out simplify it and what you're going to end up with is see squ X so the derivative of tan X is secant 2 x again if you want to see these well I don't know if they prove them in your book but you can come and see me I'll show you the or do the quotient rule on your own that might be an example for you to try later do the quotient rule on S over cosine do you see what I'm talking about s over cosine do the quotient rule on S over cosine it'll work out eventually to see squ X might take a little bit of trigonometry to get there but it will there's three more let's try see what's the derivative of secant x well notice how secant is really one over cosine isn't it you could really do a quotient rule with that if you wanted to the derivative of one would be zero though so that might be kind of nice for you over the the cosine squ what's going to end up working out for you is secant tangent secant x tangent X if you did what's the next want to do cosecant derivative of cosecant well cosecant is one/ s so if you did the quo rule again you should be able to find out what cosecant is this is netive cosecant coent last one what I miss make sure I'm right yeah netive cose 2 x I really should have these switched so you really see something about it I'm not going to though because that would involve me rewriting it I really don't want to do that so look at a couple things firstly s goes to cosine cosine goes to negative sign if you look down here with the these really should be opposite to match up with the uh cosecant and see do you see what I'm saying mhm the cosecant would match up with our sign but it gives you a different sign so negative the secant gives you the positive that's a different sign but look at this secant cosecant tangent cotangent that kind of matches up little bit at least you can make that similarity there also if tangent gives you secant squar cang gives you negative cosecant squar you see the secant cosecant relationship the square the square positive negative so learn those ones maybe you can get a relationship in your head that how how to remember it I remember that in that certain way way so that's how I do it but you're going to need to memorize those cuz they come up a lot so you're going to find those out a lot and a lot and a lot did you got those I don't expect you to memorize them right now so if I go uh coent you're go I don't know well Co yay got it but ultimately you need to remember them uh for the test and things like that okay for your homework you go a lot quicker if you have to look them up all the time well I'm going to leave those on the board would' like to do a couple examples on how to use these sure of course yeah one day we should all act like we're it what do you mean act like in drama class you know this is the highlight of my life this is the highlight of your life he going to break his P this is literally without calculus one you can't do calculus 2 two or three differential any your next classes are worthless if you can't do this means you won't get a job you won't get married unless you're already married if you don't finish this you'll be divorce no I'm just kid just kidding kidding you won't get a job no money no car no girl it's Friday you got no job you don't end up like that right so this this what did you say it was the highlight of your life no it's the highlight of your life I think that's the the straw man logical fallacy that's just slippery slope actually I thought it was building up something in Slippery slpp I have fil 10 right now what did I do slippery SLP I slippy sled you all tell them Mr Leonard slippy slope me just make sure they know the context I don't know kids are weird sub I want us to find the derivative for y = x sinx that's what that's my goal that's what we want to do now I'll tell you what I have a lot of people right now who are going to do this because they don't see something that they should be saying a lot of people if they look at that the first time they go oh well that's very easy the derivative will be cosine X one time cosine X you see how they could make that mistake what do you need to do in order to do this derivative explain why it's a product rule I have a function of x times a function of X do you see it that's important for you guys to start seeing that stuff so that's definitely a product rule so we're going to have to set up the product rule go ahead and set it up Dera of the first * the second plus the first * the Der of second set that up after that it's almost a non problem these ones are kind of nice or this one can that's the appropriate way to set that up that's the product rule it says a derivative of the first one * the second one plus the first one time a der the second one do you have that on your paper something that will match that okay cool uh now we take it where the ddxs are we we don't take derivative of things that don't have an immediate DDX that says take the derivative of this little piece what's the derivative of this little piece okay do I take the Der of that so that should still be 1 * sin x you follow so sin x plus do I take the derivative of x no I'm leave it X do I take the derivative of sin x and what's the derivative of sin x good not negative cosine just just cosine X time cosine X so cos x so our derivative is sinx plus x cosine X what's it stand for what did we just do SL slope that's a slope because that's a derivative so this is the slope of that this is a slope function for that curve so everywhere we want to find the slope if we just plug in that point to here that would give us a slope of that are you with me on this so far I want to do a specific one I want to say find the tangent line give you an easy one at x = 2 hey tell me something what two things do you need to make the equation of any line point slope okay do we have a point yet no not really a point has something comma something we only have a something so we don't have a point do we have a slope kind of we have a function that will give you the slope do we have either of them right now the way it is no what I want is I want an m equals and I want a point that's what I want I use the top function well let's see let's let's talk about that if I wanted to find the slope right now the slope right now I have a function for the slope would I plug in to here to find the slope no to here to find the slope what am I going to plug in to find the slope yeah because that's my x coordinate that will tell me the slope of that curve at that point at the x equals that value so let's plug that in I'm going to have s of Pi / 2 plusun / 2 * cosine 2 that's what this looks like s / 2 +un / 2 * cosine 2 it's going to help you if you know this the basic angles of this the the basic cosine of pi over 2 pi 4 Pi at least those ones what's s of Pi / 2 what's cosine of Pi / 2 so this is 1 + < / 2 yeah it doesn't change * 0 how much is this whole thing so my SL is one oh that's a nice SL very cool yeah we the SL is one with that are you okay with this you we just basically plugged that value into this slope for function and got out one that's our our expression let's do the point what goes here good because it's my x coordinate says x = 2 2 how can I find my y yeah you know what even says it to you doesn't it says y equals so it says what's y equal tells you right there y equals something in terms of X plug in the X so it's going to be X sin x x sin x that's try y = x sin x so Y in our case Pi / 2 * sign ofun / 2 sure so s of piun / 2 you all gave me that is 1 < / 2 * 1 is 1 I no no it's not what are you talking about it's two 5 2 * one you're like yeah yeah no no two sorry got ahead of myself now we have a point of slope now go ahead and use y - y1 = MX - X1 to figure that out what' you get what's that mean this way vertical vertical vertical be like this diagonal no this is like yeah like this yal x yeah it's a diagonal line SL of one no problem so we can now find tangent lines with trigonometric functions as well as long as we know how to take those derivatives be aware that the product rule and the quotient rule will appear here it's going to happen would you ra have feel okay with this so far good I'm going to give you one to do on your own let's see how good you are let's do start here I'll leave this on the board for you for a second I'd like you to find the D of that no tangent line right now just find the derivative okay [Music] [Applause] remember this is certainly a quotient rule so low D High minus high D low Square the bottom way you go you also need to use parenthesis where appropriate don't leave those things hanging out if you're multiplying by something for did you get the same thing as I did low D High minus high D low at least you set you set up right mm okay now we follow the DDX it's all this calcul up is about follow the DDX go slowly precisely get the right derivatives as you're going so we have the formula set up correctly just follow the DDX and show you work if you try to do too much of stuff in your head I swear it's really hard uh you got to go slowly write lots lots of work out I know that takes a tremendous amount of paper but trust me it's work it you want to get the right answer slowly rather than the wrong answer quickly that that' be the wrong way to go so here we'll have do I take the derivative of 1 plus cosine X there I need parentheses still because I'm multiplying times the derivative of sin x what's the Dera of sinx folks good okay got it minus I don't take the derivative of sinx but I do take the derivative of 1 + cosine X what's the derivative of 1 + cosine X what happens to the one derivative of one would give you zero then you do the derivative of cosine that's going to give you a negative sign so we're going to be multiplying here by negative make sure it's in parentheses because you're multiplying by a negative there you're not subtracting multiply by negative sinx all over don't forget about that bottom 1 + cosine x^ 2 how made it that far good hey calculus is done right as soon as you finished that there's no more D if as soon as there's no more ddxs your Calculus is over with now it's just algebra and manipulation of those rational expression well not even rational those expressions right now uh so our trigonometric rational expression so if we distribute here we're going to get cosine plus good then what sin X2 is not the same as Sin s x this you're squaring sign this is not that is not the same thing if you're putting that this is an angle right here we're actually squaring the sign this is the same sure that's what I was writing that is that is that right but if you omit those parentheses now you got this is wrong okay this implies this that would be incorrect okay you can't do that can't change those angles unless you actually use one of the formulas to change angles so we're going to put our sin x like that are you with that so far cool cool tell me something awesome that happens yeah trigonometry is awesome it's happening right now calculus also awesome it's happening right now uh but something even awesomer I yeah what identity you need to see the identity what's this give you that's a one cosine 2 X Plus sin s unless I'm wrong that doesn't happen very often just kidding it happens all the time but yeah that's one so this is that was funny and nothing it must be Monday killing me today cosine x + 1 over 1 + cosine X Square give me something else take off the square can you cross those out do you see how there one entire term one entire term right now one one H well factor I suppose one entire Factor here with here so that and that is gone what's on our numerator still and that's our derivative would you raise your hand and feel okay with this one so far good deal all right what did we just find again that is a derivative what is a derivative so we found the slope that's a slope function if I asked you to find an equation of a line through a certain point you'd use that for your slope you'd plug in your value to that to get your point and then you use y - y1 x - X1 same ideas are you guys all right with this so far by the way if I asked you for so a different example that could you do it yes okay what does that mean by the way just a second derivative let's take the second derivative so let's find that what's the first derivative please okay the find the second derivative sure D cos sin x what's a third derivative say it again negative cosine X would be the third derivative are you with me on that negative cosine because if we if we have sinx the derivative of s is cosine this is negative cosine if I take the derivative how about the fourth derivative why derivative of cosine Isa sign * negative gives you a positive sign that's interesting it's really weird how about the fifth derivative six let's see uh let's see fifth der six d 7 8 back forth oh that's Cal so when we take that derivatives of sign like that that's kind of interesting unless we have a quoti rules it is cyclical eventually by the way could you have done this if I asked you to evaluate this at x = / 2 what's that mean to do plug that in you're going to get netive one in this case you with me on that so we can evaluate also just don't forget what that means this would mean that this is one so we have negative one you still okay so far are you ready to try just a a word problem that has this as some of its base is um y of X when you take it to the fourth is that due to the S of x s x period coming back to the same coming back like it shows in the text the sign of X goes over and it shows where where the D would occur for for S of X and is does that have anything to do with it oscillating back and forth oh it has it has a lot to do with oscillating yeah I mean you got to figure that if if the derivative of s is cosine that means that the slope of s is cosine but the slope of cosine is negative sign if we keep on doing that we're just finding basically the fourth derivative is a slope of the third derivative if the third derivative is cosine we're going to be getting sign out of that which is it's really it's interesting problem but it does have to do with it it's U the relationship between s and cosine talking about the like goes up and down like that right whether the fourth DP has to do with that it where it oscillates you know because it goes and it comes back to the same position once you get once you go four times over we're not moving oh we're not no we're not he's talking about the SC for how it osc oh I get it yeah I understand how it goes like this remember we're not we're talking about the slope of the the entire function so we're not saying as you go four periods to the right or four Cycles to the right that's not not quite what we're doing we're tring with the slope of a curve so for instance it's going to be very hard for me to draw this but this is the idea that we're talking about here that's sign right that's a slope right oh mess up it's kind of pretty huh closer if you take and graph the value of the slope at every one of these points from here to here and you say at x equals this point the slope is this x equals this point the SL is this and this and this and this and you graph those what you're going to end up with is actually cosine here's why slope of this point is actually one there slope at this point is zero ah slope at this point is NE 1 there slope at this point is back to zero coine okay do it again you're going to do the same thing right slope is zero negative negative negative negative you're going to get negative sign but you're going to go back and forth and back and forth you're talking about slopes of things slopes of and the third derivative second der the slope of the slope function fourth of the slope of the slope of this you're just talking about the previous the slope of the previous function does that make sense to you that that's why you getting these things you're not moving at all you're talking about the slopes of your function that's the idea looks cool though doesn't it pretty does that answer your question okay now for a real example I'm not going to call this a super fun word problem because I got a comment on my little thing that was not super fun so this is just a word problem this is a super hard word problem hard it's not I'm just joking no sense of humor today at all nothing honestly stand up next time maybe we'll get it got that one of Taiwan I don't okay so let's say that you put a spring on the ceiling right here and you you attach a weight to it it's going to stretch a little bit right let's say you hold it real steady and so it's just it's stretching that spring and just it's sticking there and one of your jerks comes along what's it going to do it's going to go right back and forth let's neglect friction of air and all that stuff is it going to do that forever no let's neglect like friction and all that is it going to do that forever yeah it's going to oscillate right it's not it's not going to lose anything if we just let it go and go and go in the vacuum and stuff like that that okay it's just going to do that forever and ever that's going to mimic a sign or a cosine function as a matter of fact if we look at this I'll write out the example right now uh we we attach a spring and a mass stretches at 3 cm Beyond its resting position a spring is stretched 3 cm Beyond its resting position and released so you go to the thing go and it goes okay so it's oscillating back and forth at let's make it at a certain time at T equals z let's talk about the position function let's talk about the position function if you if you were to draw this let's say this would be the the spring and here's a little weight that's attached okay and you're going to stretch this 3 cm Beyond its resting position so stretch implies that you're going to pull it down further true are you going to start at zero when you oscillate where are you going to start 3 cim down one two you're going to actually start at -3 true and what's going to happen is it is going to go up reach a climax go down and up and down and up and down true so it's going to go up and then down and then up down just like that forever and ever and ever what does that look like does that look like a sign a cosine a positive sign or a negative uhga sorry a sign a cosine positive negative sign or a negative cosine which one negative cosine negative sign would look like this starting at zero and going this is a negative cosine starting negatively and then going up so if we were to to make a model of this we'd say it starts at -3 but it's definitely a cosine function because I'm not starting at zero it's negative because it's like the the reflection of a normal cosine it's starting down here instead of up there that would be positive three you okay with that so far all I'd like us to do is talk about the velocity the velocity of the mass at a certain point so we know it's going to be oscillating back and forth and really the velocity should be zero here and here and here shouldn't it because that's where it's changing going up to going down it's going to pause and go down what I'd like to do is just find the velocity for this find the velocity function what's velocity as it is related to position so basically just find the first derivative so find the first derivative of -3 cosine T first question I have for you since I have -3 * cosine of T do I need a product rule or not explain that explain why I don't need a product rule here yeah I don't have a variable at all I don't have a function of T I just have the number3 being multiplied by that right and if I did the product rule you take the derivative of -3 that should give you zero and so that would fall out of your equation anyway you don't need the product rule for this so this one we'd say all right the3 is a constant that will be there no matter what SO3 * our derivative what's the derivative of cosine of T can you tell me what that is so-3 * s t I'm showing you a little extra step so that you can see what's actually going on here -3 * s of t uh what's what's that going to give you now could I ask you things like um where will this curve have a velocity of zero could you find it now if you set that equal to zero you know what you're going to find you're going to find this point and that point and that point every point where it changes from rising to Falling or falling to Rising that would give you those horizontal slopes right right that would be a velocity of zero where it's changing um I can also ask you for any tangent line here say find the tangent line at Pi 2 find the tent line at 3 pi over 4 things like that you should be able to do that as well how many people feel okay with what we' talked about so far good deal right are you ready for the next thing yes yes the answer is yes you you are I know cuz I'm your teacher I could tell you're ready here's the next thing the next thing ask this question we're just going to do a little little intro right now it says can you take the derivative of this can you take the derivative of that yes of course of course you can what's the derivative of that thing cool and if I did this can you take the derivative of that thing really how would you do it okay you could use the product rule couldn't you you could do 3x^2 - 4 * 3x2 - 4 you do the product rule or maybe a little bit simpler you could distribute this true and then take it term by term right what that one you can still do it but you're going have to distribute probably three times or distribute it once and then use a product rule either way it's going to get a little bit more tedious right okay what about that one you go you use the power Ru s that's crap not CR oh crra CR CR you Leonard yeah no not crra crap oh crap why crap because this is ridiculous you don't have to distribute that out 100 times or use a product rle like 5 I don't know what it 100 times uh you don't want to do that do you we're going to learn something that's called The Chain rule what the chain rule allows you to do is treat your function like a composition to get around the fact that you have a large exponent or treat your function to as a composition so that you can get around something like this cuz I haven't showed you how to do that the answer to this write this down and cross it out is never this no I'm going to show you how we can use compositions in something called The Chain rule to deal with these two types of problems because these two types of problems come up in awful L if you know the chain rule you can deal with them very very concisely if you don't you're stuck you're stuck with this you understand the idea about why we're going to learn the chain rule next then we're going to tie everything together chain rule is the last rule that we have uh then we're going to go ahead combine product rule quo rule chain rule all that stuff make it real nice you'll be able to do every derivative that I give you
