Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 4.2:  Integration by Substitution
now after we do all this stuff any questions good since you've had the introduction to integrals we can now talk about some more advanced concepts it's a little bit better I think it's funner you might not think so at first but you will promise I'll brainwash you like North Korea looking forward to this my life follow [Applause] integration by substitution here's the point behind integration by substitution what you're doing is trying to make a difficult integral easier remember from what I first told you this was not a lie in order to do an integral it must fit in your integration table do you remember that it has to if it doesn't you cannot do it it's got to fit so what we try to do is either manipulate the inside of our integral somehow by Distributing or dividing remember like you did on your hopefully you started your homework you do manipulate trig functions do all that and make it fit somehow what this is called by the way is a u substitution we'll be using the letter U let me give you a for instance on why we have this and it's all about this problem write down that problem we'll talk about in a second um firstly ladies and gentlemen does that problem fit your integration table exactly like it is no I it's got some parentheses got some stuff being multiplied knowing what you know right now how would you do that sure and that it'd be fairly easy right it actually very easy how about that a little bit long you could right you could though still do you could foil it out three times and then distribute your 2X and you could do it there someone like that is that something you want to do only if you're crazy that's when you don't do the homework yeah that's when you go Mr Leonard you not you failed me you didn't teach me right there's got to be a better way and the better way is this does not fit your integration table for some of you who think this is possible it's not you can't distribute this in there okay you can't do that that's an exponent the only thing you would you have fall or operations right expon before multiplication you have to do all that I could teach you binomial expansion but you'd be at the 50th row of Pascal's triangle with some pretty easy stuff but still it would be it'd be longer than the sport before you were done okay it'd be crazy now we're going to learn something different called integration by substitution what it's going to allow us to do is Substitute part of our integral for the letter U thereby making a really hard integral really really easy you want to see how to do it of course because it makes your life easier I'm saving your I'm literally saving your life that would take you like a year it's going to take us two minutes see I've saved you however many minutes around a year minus two you're welcome here's your steps the first thing you're going to do is pick you so that integral is easier I know that's vague I know it's vague but I'll give you some notes on that you're trying to pick U so the integral is easier not harder sometimes you'll pick the wrong U it's okay you'll know it in 10 seconds or less seriously pick U so the integral is easier right yeah yes you can pick you so it becomes harder you don't want to do that but you'll know it it's you'll get stuck here's two big hints It's usually the it's usually get it you usually It's usually the inside of something it's usually the inside of something and here's a musthave the derivative is somewhere in the integral the derivative of your U is somewhere in your integral already okay disregarding constants the constants don't matter I'll teach you how to do stuff without constants but the derivative is far as the X's go must be an integral no I'm just going to leave it to you that confuses me it's got to be an integral somewhere also make a note this this does not include constants you don't really care so much about the constants disregard constants second step that's where all the work happens by the way Second Step third step fourth step very easy uh Second Step is we're going to transform our integral from X DX to UU so translate our X's to use our D DXs to duse remember how your D whatever has to that's your variable if I'm going to put some 's up there I can't have a DX anymore that's not going to happen I need to have a du so I'm going to teach you how to do that too transform something in terms of X DX to Something in terms of U du after that it will be in your integration table if it's not you have to do another substitution or something else or the integral is not possible using these methods there are some that are not possible and you can't do them or you can't do them with this integration by parts or a trig substitution it's got to be in a table there's things that we can't do in this class right when we we get to skim surface step three will be solve your integral so do integral and step four notice what's what's happened here I I know it's very vague because I haven't shown you an example but I need you to think through it okay with me you're picking u u is going to take the place of some X did you get that concept can take the place of some X therefore when you go from DX to Du we got that down then we're going to do our integral but you're still going to be in terms of U so you need to translate it back into terms of X does that make sense you got to end with whatever variable you start with so translate back to you I I think I said you I meant X translate back to X okay now for the good stuff I'll show you how to do this problem now what's the bad part in this integral what's the bad part is the 2x a bad part not really what's the bad part50 probably this part right that part now when you're doing a U substitution often times you don't pick the whole thing you pick the inside thing you cover it up and you go okay if I If This Were A U could I still take the integral and then here's what you do you go if this was a u can you take the integral of U to the 50th absolutely so don't take this as your integral take just I'm sorry as your you take just this little part here's why you take just that little part you're going to have to take a derivative of this you have to so you want something where you take a derivative and it doesn't completely Jack your problem up because you're going to to put it back in your integral here's what we're talking about I'm going to pick usually the inside and it has to be such that the derivative is in your integral somewhere so of this you can do the derivative of that right yeah take the derivative of that what is it 2 is 2x in your integral yeah it's going to work no it's going to work it's now if this was your U your derivative would be 50 x^2 + 1 49th power * 2x is that in your integral no that would be the wrong way to go here's why it has to be in your intergral you're going to see this in about 45 seconds U = X2 + 1 are you okay with the U we pick the inside of something also the derivative has to match up with something in your integral not necessarily constants even if the two look at even if the two wasn't there it would still be okay the constant doesn't matter that much now what you're going to need to do is take a derivative implicitly of both sides so if I take a derivative the derivative of U is Du the derivative of this side is what 2x 2X and DX by the way here's why if you want to know the why because it looks weird right now um most I guess most teachers don't show it this way but I'll show you if you took an integral with respect to x what you get is D DX = 2x right solve for du 2 that's where we get we do that every time so give you du and DX on different sides so you can work it like that if if that makes sense to you use that does it make sense to you that always made sense to me so in your case this is going to be du this is going to be 2x DX we feel okay with that so far now here's a cool part we can do this like a double substitution not only are we going to substitute this part for some U which we already are going to be able to do but you can also substitute your DX if you can solve for DX so can you solve this for DX yes how would you solve this for DX if I divide by 2x by the way I know I teach this different from some of you who have had calculus before I teach it a little different I think this works better uh because you can actually see the simplification happen in this problem okay are you still okay you sure so let me recap for a second I guess was more than 45 seconds but now you'll see why you had to have your derivative somewhere in your integral we look at this we find the part that sucks it's usually the inside of something the derivative has to be there take that as your U take a derivative of both sides you're going to get a du every time that's going to happen you're you never have anything weird like 2 U or 4 U you that doesn't happen you just take your derivative of U you get du take your derivative of this side you're going to get 2X and DX solve for DX raise your have you feel completely okay with this now you do the substitution instead of 2x + 1 what do I put do I still have to the 50th power yes yes this became my U to the 50th now check it out my 2x is there but what is my DX instead du du over what yes U 50th 2x DX you got it hey look at the two x's is one on numerator one on denominator this is basically like writing this it's basically like writing 1 over 2x du like that your 2 X's are gone gone integral of U to the 50th du notice how we have to have this is important this is why I make you guys write the D some people do integrals they don't write the DX they don't write the DU do you see why you have to have that it tells you what variable you're integrating with respect to so if you didn't change to Du and still at DX this is not possible you can't do it so we had to change that we had to write the DU now can you take the integral of U to the 50th everybody should be able to do this what is it perfect actually pretty easy and right now we're here we're here we translated we're right here you got to translate back into X you see we start with x's we're now in terms of U how much is your U it's on the paper right X just put x s + one back there x^2 + 1 in parentheses to the 50th power 51st power over 51 plus C that's your in does it actually work if you take a derivative we we probably do it in our head it's kind of a simple one you bring down the 51 gone to the 50th power times the derivative of inside because you're using a chain rule that gives you 2x that is the appropriate integral that's it is it art medium easy it's going to you have to understand it you have to really understand it one note that that you need on this you're going to notice that all of your X's must be gone before you can integrate do you see that you cannot integrate with both x's and U's it can't happen so all your X's must disappear before you integrate is that why the coent is no matter of the X yes coefficients you can pull out in front of your integral right you're going to see that some of the later examples this was a very very basic example but I wanted to get this so you can understood it so all of your X's must disappear and the only way you can do that is through the DU over your X's no oh is there other method yeah okay I don't how eliminated either's two L's or one L I don't like El's hence my name you name with two l i just say it Ard not forget the L Mr Mr Enard way better way better It's Tricky lv's swear you know sometimes this U substitution stuff is pretty obvious until you get to trig and then it becomes a little bit more cumbersome but stick with the idea that your derivative has to appear somewhere that you have to cross stuff out you have to get rid of things and then it helps you a lot so in this one hopefully we can kind of pick out the U Already can you pick out the U Already when all El fails if you're like oh my gosh I don't know just pick the inside pick the inside the whole the just the inside not the exponent the inside and try it once it hurt you to try you just take a derivative and see if you're right I mean it takes 10 15 seconds maybe tops and that's better than doing nothing so here I'm definitely not going to pick that that really doesn't make it better I want to pick this to make the inside go away right if I pick the inside it goes away I have U to the 5ifth that's a piece of cake also do you notice that the derivative of this is in your integral what's the derivative of this 2 no the Der is not 2X the derivative of this is what 3x2 ignore the three and say it again right there don't care about the the three but the x s has to be there so U = XB - 4 du = 3x^2 DX I want you to solve for DX solve for DX how do you solve for DX here divide by what okay so do that give me little head knot look up at the board here give me a head knot if you're okay on getting down to that far are you yes yes okay cool now it's time to do your substitution as soon as you choose your U and you do the derivative thing and you solve for DX you can substitute and see which you have is look up here is X still here yes I didn't substitute in for that is this still here what is this to the good that fifth is still there you never take that power oh my gosh that'd be ridiculous right because look your derivative is right here it have to show up in your integral in order for you to simplify it and then instead of DX I'm going to write do you see anything simplifies here what simplifies what about the three is a three on a numerator or denominator so here's what I'm going to do for you I'm going to say well that is a three it's basically 1/3 right what can you do with constants that's why constants don't matter that's why you disregard the constants because they really don't affect you in terms of X or U right it's just a number being multiplied so this is 1/3 I know you can take the integral of that that's U to 6 over 6 plus C we'll do one more step we're going to multiply those fractions together we're also going to in insert back in what our U is equal to that's x 3r minus 4 so our our final answer should be x 3r - 4 all to 6 power over 18 plus C are we red light yellow light green light are we green light on this stuff are we good to go are you sure are you okay on and seeing where your use coming from it's probably the most important part seeing that after that everything really falls into place as long as you follow these steps I've outlined for you you take your derivative you solve for DX that's not hard that's algebra you plug it in you cross some stuff out pull out any constants and then you'll have a very simple integral it has to be simple it has to fit in your table if it doesn't you either made a mistake or you can't do it and that's the the whole thing or you have to make a a double substitution which does happen um occasionally we might get to one let's keep rolling got some good stuff going on so far how about this now if I gave you that integral at the beginning of integrals like last section you'd be stuck right there's no way you're going about doing that because that does not fit in your integration table that's s of x to 4th that's times 2x Cub you can't separate integrals by multiplication you can't take the integral of this the integral of this and the integral of that and think you're going to be right it's not going to happen the only thing we have left to us is substitution that's all you get in this class you get either it somehow fits you have to make it fit or you get substitution that's it there's no other method that we have in 4 a in first semester calculs it's only two options you got so let's try to pick something for our you why don't you write down what you think as you don't say it out loud why don't you write down what you think would be a good you remember the two criteria it's usually inside of something not the whole thing but inside of something and the derivative must be there got to be there so question should I pick sign what's the derivative of sign do you see a then there's then sign's not the right choice how about 2x to the 3 is it inside of something not a good choice also the derivative is an X squ do I see an X squ anywhere up there that's my good choice just X to 4th did you pick X to 4th okay so put it off to the side you have to show your work be organ be organized trust me be organized with this cuz doing U integration by parts later in your next semester you're going to to be very organized with it otherwise you're you're going to lose stuff because any by Parts sometimes you integrate by Parts which is they'll teach you that then then you have to use substitution on both of them it's it gets crazy if you're not organized okay we have x to the 4th yall tell me what's the next step that we do okay do it hopefully you still remember how to take derivatives right that's why we had to cover derivatives before integrals for this stuff uh okay what's your next step after you do your derivative don't forget the cube that's going to be du over 4X Cub = DX still okay so far now you substitute for whatever you've picked the only things you substitute for are your U and your DX everything else stays there until you cross it out so let me ask you this question uh does the 2x Cub stay there y does the sign stay there does The X to 4 stay there what does that become that's your U very good does your DX stay there how much is your DX equal to show hands tell people okay with this example so trig function yes hard not really pick a u it becomes easier why is it become easier what happens now the X cubes are gone to right they're they're done that's great that has to happen right you have to get rid of your X's because now you're in terms of you you got to be in terms of youu and then you pull your four outside pull your four outside along with what other number the two over four that's going to give You2 do you see the 1/2 that I'm talking about so this is 2 over 4 I can show you both steps if you want 2 over 4 sin uu that's one2 sin U du now don't say it out loud because you need to practice trust me I want you on your paper to put down the integral of sign you don't s out try it on your own I know you're all going to give me cosine but what I'm looking for is whether it's positive cosine or negative cosine hopefully you put negative cosine did you put negative cosine yes good for you if you put positive cosine check it again you need be able to take a derivative of it and it gives you sign so this is negative cosine U plus are you okay with this so far what's the last thing that we do transl yeah maybe make it prettier that negative I don't like that in there I want to make this -2 cosine U but U is X 4th so I'm going to make this - 12 cosine X to 4 plus C that's how it should look at the end of your problem or if you wanted to put this over two you could do that what you can't do is this please look at the board please notice that2 does never ever goes inside an angle this is never x 4 2 you can't do that you can't break that angle relationship this is not multiplication it's cosine of something of some angle so you can't do any operations inside of that can't pull anything out unless you use angle formulas or something like like that uh we'll start one more I want to show you something here real quick we have about what 30 45 seconds left now this one looks pretty darn nasty yeah yeah but let's really think about what's going on here this is going to help you on some of your home works all right this is going to really help you actually what's the bracket mean but what's it mean everything's together take the integral of that right of what of all the stuff inside now tell me something you do with integrals as far as it relates to this problem separate add say say louder you can separate them by the addition side or subtraction right the only thing you can't touch is multiplication division so I could actually separate these two things get 1x^2 plus uh d D X Plus s^ 2kx DX that makes it a whole lot easier why does it make a whole lot easier well well look that's basic that's in your table make it X to -2 do the problem this that's integration by substitution sure you substitute your U = pix do the same thing so that's actually a little bit easier does that make sense to you so when you have an addition subtraction bre break it up before you start doing a substitution break it up sometimes you'll if you tried substitution here it's not going to work because you have this relationship that that'd be a bad thing you would want to do it there so break it up by addition subtraction then do your substitution on individual parts now if you remember we're doing integration which is basically find an anti-derivative and in some in other words find the area underneath the curve or find the area function of a curve and we're doing a special case of integration where it doesn't necessarily fit into the integration table exactly so we use some sort of substitution typically a use substitution to make it fit it's kind of like making this thing work for us which is great now I gave you a couple hints on how to do this number one hint is you're usually picking the inside of a function the inside part it's typically in parentheses or underneath a square root or something to a power you don't pick the whole thing you just pick a part of the thing the part that's actually giving you a problem for instance in this case the part that is not actually in the integration table so if I'm looking at this I know cosin's there but it says cosine X not 5x so what I would pick for the U in this case ISX the 5x yeah that's the inside also we'd say the derivative of your U typically must show up in the integral somewhere disregarding constants so let me ask you this what's a question of what's a question what's the derivative of 5x now we don't care about the five being up there because that's a constant we'll be able to pull that out as 1 uh so basically just our X's have to match up so again our idea was let's make a U substitution so that our integral will ultimately fit into our integration table if it fits then we can do it if it doesn't fit we basically can't do it right now now what did we do after we took the substitution what's the next step find of okay so derivative of both sides basically it's implicit differentiation we're keeping the DX on the right hand side so here we'll have du here we'll have 5 DX and I've told you to solve for DX some people do this differently uh some people don't solve for DX some people try to substitute in for uh make it something X DX and substitute for du I prefer solving for DX it just makes it a little bit easier for us so if we divide both sides by five we have du over 5 equals DX that lets us make our substitution so we go all right the cosine doesn't change but the 5x I'm going to let that become U and I'm going let DX become du over 5 the key thing for us was that in order to take an integration or do an integral two things must happen it's got to fit your table and the variables have to match so our respect to that variable must be the only variable you see there's x's and U's you've done something wrong or hav't gone very far enough so something has to take place where you have one variable and that that's the variable you're talking about you with me on this so far now the over five what can I do with that over five that's why we disregard the constants we really don't care about those it's all about the variables so this over five means 1 cosine u d that will be 1 all right folks let's do the integral of cosine U don't say it out loud I'll give you all just a second to think about it try to get in your head before someone says it okay so so think think think as I've been talking and rambling to keep you guys from Talking have you thought about the integral of cosine U of course it's going to be something to do with sign is it positive sign or negative sign oh you guys are guessing now don't guess at the stuff if you said negative sign take the derivative of negative sign it would give you negative cosine that is not what we have right there the derivative of s gives you cosine yes yes and that's the correct integral therefore does that make sense so be careful it's all about the signs with your trig uh it's it's never I mean no one's ever going to go um tangent yay no no one's ever going to make that mistake you're all going to give me sign right just depends on whether you get the sign right right anyway we're almost done there's one more thing that we have to do we we didn't start in terms of U so we can't leave it in terms of U we're going to translate this back to X's use the same substitution you you just made so our answer our integral will be 1/5 s of 5x and of course we got that plus C at the back end saying that could be any constant and still work as a function so that I take a derivative of it gives you back my cosine 5x by the way can you check your work absolutely absolutely take a simple derivative do you see the chain rule coming back at you the 1/5 time the five from that chain rule it's gone you got your cosine 5x how many feel okay with our example that's kind of refresher from last time since we had a a weekend in between here now let's do uh let's do one where I have you do this completely on your own see if you can do this and then I'll show you how to finally finish that example I I had you look at last time there you go let's work on that one not too bad just make sure you know the idea of the substitution well I hope for you in this case that the U is fairly obvious uh in the in this one the U is the only thing there the only thing I I wanted to make sure you here is do you take the exponent when you're picking a u do you ever take the exponent with it no because the derivative has to be there right so if I took a derivative of that it's 15 2x- that's not going to appear again in our integral that's that's not going to work out for so it's it's almost exclusively the inside of something uh that you pick for your U and and that works like 90% of the time by the way this substitution method sometimes makes integrals go really really fast have you found that out too it's kind of nice if you can find the right substitution that's the hardest part then it works itself out last thing we'll do if you don't want to put a plus c right here that's fine just make sure it's at the very end of your problem you have to have a plus c but make sure you have substitute back in for X I get a lot of people make it down this far which is technically correct but it's also te it's also incorrect because we want this in terms of X not in terms of U so if you didn't make it down that far just do your substitution and that's what we should get how many people were able to make it down that far on their own good that's that's all about everybody that's fantastic all right now if this is new to you then of course this is going to take you some time to figure out now the last one before we go on to some a little bit more advanced idea up here the last one I think I showed you the first step here last time I said that don't don't let the integral really confuse you into making you think it's something harder than it is uh namely if I were to look at that integral right now and try to pick a substitution there is not a good substitution for that right now because if I pick that as my U I'm still going to have X in there right so I'd have a du something and I'd have a x and that's not going to work out for you you can't do a direct substitution on that interval the way it is right here but what what you can do is use some of the principles of integrals they're basically the same as derivatives uh it says you can pull constants outside of your integral if they're being multiplied by some function of X it says you can split up the integral or derivative by addition and subtraction not multiplication but definitely addition subtraction so what this says is this is really not one giant integral it's actually two separate integrals if you want to think about it that way so the first thing I'm doing some of these integrals if they look too daunting you're like oh my gosh I don't even know where to begin see if there's a plus and a minus if there is sometimes you're able to separate those and sometimes it makes it easier and I know I did show this to you last time but this you can look at as 1x^2 DX don't forget the DX and see s of pix don't forget the DX now can you do this one MH what would be the first step on doing that one by the way bring the X to the top very good because it's got to fit your table right there's no substitution needed you don't need that but you know how to do this one already we practice that how about this one is there a substitution necessary for this one yeah there is because that's not just an X that's a PIX what I'd like you to do is figure that out okay go ahead and do both integrals this one's kind of a basic one this one's going to require substitution for it for so what do you do with these things when it's plus and minus or you're supposed to break up first which is also what you're supposed to do with your girlfriend right before Valentine's Day just so you know way you don't have to buy presents it's a bogus holiday anyway christm if you time it right and you break up right before Valentine's and right before her birthday and right before Christmas and get back with her it's awesome he saves so much money just kidding just I've never personally done that I know someone who was done to but she three times I'll tell you the story later okay so your U should be pix remember it's it's the inside of something if you're having trouble looking for a or finding a u and there's something in parenthesis try it what's it hurt I it takes 5 Seconds to figure out you're wrong right that's all it takes so if you're having trouble just pick something and if you're wrong you're wrong who cares just go back and redo it later pick something else there's only a finite number of selections you can make in an integral so if you try something and you're right great if you try something you're wrong just pick something else don't give up du in this case is Pi Pi DX so du oh remember Pi is a constant right so if it was 3x it'd be 3 now it's not 3x it's 3.141592 whatever forever but it's Pi so D over pi equals DX and now we can go ahead and make our substitution and it only affects the second integral because I have two distinct integrals now which is great and that's what we want so here we're going to have integral of the secant squar does not change only the angle changes remember this is not being multiplied either that is not a multiplication that's secant of of not not times that's your angle you can't manipulate that in any other way besides the substitution that's going to be a u and then du over Pi how many people made the substitution looks just like that good that's fantastic that's a correct substitution now this integral is pretty easy we're going to do x to the -3 over3 right what I do wrong it's a very common mistake yeah and some people go oh you're adding 2+ 1 is three well you have negatives here so it's kind of flipp on you-1 over1 don't add a plus c yet that's fine we can add a plus c at the very end of our problem if you add it now it might get a little confusing for you then a plus sign because you have a plus sign I know the integral of see squ U is good because a derivative of tangent is secant Square that's why that works remember we're just going opposite of a derivative now not tangent squar either just tangent U what happens to that Pi one I guess I'll show you that step huh the over Pi you can make that one over pi and then secant s u if you'd like to show that that's probably the appropriate way to write it show your constants pulling out it's on a denominator stays on a denom and then go for it we already talked this is tangent U have a plus c here or not we just need one plus C at the very end of our problem we'll probably make things a little bit prettier and what I mean by that is we'll drop down our negative exponent this will be -1x this will be plus tangent well tangent of U now our U is listed right up here we just have to put it back in its place you you can have one over Pi if you'd like or you can have the whole thing over Pi if you'd like it doesn't really matter one thing I do have to make certain that you do know do those pies cross out no Heaven no OMG that earns you a big fat Circle no with like 10 exclamation points and I burn your paper in front of you right that's what that earns you no you can't because like I said that's not multiplication that's an angle this is division you cannot cross that there's no trig rule that says you can what you do need to do is put a plus c how many people feel okay with that example good so looks difficult sure is it really no not not really is this one not really as long as you know the correct substitution that's what this whole process is about and that's why I'm giving you so many examples so you kind of see some different instances of what you can do uh what you can't do and some substitutions you ready to tackle this problem then yes okay now is that in your integration table no no s is cosine is but not s Square cosine well here's the deal if we're talking about using a substitution to solve this well what would a good substitution be because here's here's a deal if I pick cosine the derivative of cosine is negative sign right well that's up there if I pick s the derivative of sign is cosine well that's up there so which is the correct choice and the one is the answer is the one that takes care of all the other X's so for instance if I picked let me show you how how you find out your your wrong on uh substitution in about 5 Seconds you ready here's how you find out your wrong you pick your U you take your derivative maybe 15 seconds I don't know you solve for DX and you do your substitution and it comes out with something that doesn't work for you for instance this is still s squ x right the cosine was U and DX is Du over sinx now one thing that's great about this is this is gone but only one of those is gone did I get rid of all the x's and there's nothing else you can do there if it if it didn't work out kind of nicely for you either there's another substitution you have to make or you made the wrong substitution and that's most of the time in this class that's most the time what happens all right so for us we go oh man this didn't work for us I better not try to like force this through it's kind of like U oh my gosh I almost made a Star Wars analogy uh totally yeah well anyway yeah you have to let the force flow you can't force this thing oh it didn't work it doesn't you can't make it happen you got to just let it let it work for you yes I'm that much of a so anyway how do we find S to or the correct U to begin with we'll think about it what's sin^2 x mean sin x little two right it's actually inside of parentheses with an exponent and that's the correct substitution so this really means this now of course if I wrote it like that it's a little bit easier to see now I'm not going to write it like that because we typically will write trig functions with the S squar but you need to know what that means so our appropriate U substitution is sinx derivative of sinx folks the derivative of sinx is it positive or negative cosine the derivative of sinx positive or negative cosine positive okay good solve for DX which means we're going to divide on both sides and now when we do our substitution we go all right well what gets replaced with you now does the cosine get replaced with you or the sign get repl with you do do I mess the two up or is that still there still there so this actually becomes U2 is the cosine X still here for right now yes is the DX still here no no because I need to translate that into my du somehow I know I translate it into a u I'm going to have to have a du and I know that DX was equal to cosine sorry uh cosine X under d you see anything nice that happens one of the kind of prerequisites for this to work I told you is you got to get rid of all the variables except for U you can't have both x's and U's so you have to have something that gets rid of stuff that's why we say the derivative has to be somewhere in there because when you solve for DX you divide by the derivative or you multiply in some cases by the derivative and that will show up somehow when you make your substitution it's got to be there so we're going to have have an integral of U2 now that's a whole lot easier to look at than that isn't it man this is piece of cake this is going to be U 3 over 3 no problems and then done no not yet oh you can you can right now yeah make sure you end in X's you start in X's you end in X's so sin Cub X over 3 + C still WR all is 13 time you can do one3 if you'd like because it really doesn't matter and that's true for all these problems uh how feel okay with that one good all right good would you like to try a few more yes let's do like uh one two let's do like four or five more and we'll talk about the area by the way the reason why I'm stressing this so much is because there's really only two sections on integrals that you cover it was 4.1 and this that's it the rest of the stuff is how to use them um so it's kind of like how we did derivatives right we did chain rule we did product rule quotient Rule and then for the rest of the chapters I showed you how to apply them wasn't any new different techniques and that's the way this is going to be too so this is the techniques you need in order to go further to solve the application problems in I'm going to show you all right now how about this you know what I see a lot this is hilarious I love this this is my favorite problem to some one of my favorite problems to great I think because it makes me laugh and then cry and then laugh some more when I get over crying I love seeing that could you please do that for me good I see that where are they I don't know I don't know don't do that to me okay that one day I swear one one day I know how I'm going to die it's going to be grading papers and one day my head is just going to explode and then High Velocity splatter was on your paper you're like H that must have died that's how you'll know if I don't come into class it was probably because you you're going to kill me people are going to kill no we can't do that can't do that we've talked about that a lot in this class because I need to make the the distinction between an angle and a multiplication problem so this is not true that you can just cross those things things out but what you can do is try to make that fit in integration table by a substitution now right now it's of course not I mean the only thing we have that deals with cosine is cosine X this is not cosine X or cosine U this is not cosine U we need to make it somehow that so that we can fit it so what's the appropriate substitution the co including the cosine or not do you think the square because if you include the cosine well the derivative of cosine is negative sign right that would have to show up somewhere in your integral that's not there it's also a u is typically on the inside of something so what's on the inside of something here x square root X let's take that as our U let's see see what happens so not the cosine just the square root of x and the reason why we're seeing it is not here so much it's there that's where we're seeing it now would you substitute that's a great question that's a great question well we're going to find that out right now okay so we made our substitution because I taught you how to look for it right I said it's typically on the inside of something so you're seeing because I showed you that the square root of x now you got to find the derivative of the square root of x and then see what you're going to substitute for maybe not substitute for do your substitution later later you follow me so let's go ahead and do this now in order to take a derivative I'm probably going to write this as 12 don't make the mistake of putting square or netive - 1/2 that will really mess you up you need to know how to do this correctly that's why we spend so much time doing derivatives so X to the2 uh how much is Du equal to everybody you need to know this what is it oh great everybody that's like five people come on you can do a derivative right 12 x to the what negative one2 very good so we're subtracting negative one what else do not forget DX don't forget that okay now we've done our derivative what are you supposed to do now for this problem okay let's be very careful on this and solve for DX how do you get rid of the 1/2 so I'm going to say that this is 2du = x - 12 DX is that true for you just to make it seem a little bit more understandable where this stuff is going to be coming from I'm also going to make this side prettier before I start dividing you can divide right now that's fine but you could also look at it as 2D = DX over X2 does that make sense to you you could divide option number one is doing this way option number two is this look at the board here real quick if you wanted to divide right now this would give you 2du X1 12 equal DX right you follow me on that on this case I'd be multiplying by X to the2 on both sides this will give me 2 x to2 du equal DX and you know what look at the board sold that one do you see that moving that negative up to the numerator will be 2 x to POS 12 DX d = d yeah so there's a couple ways to do this either way is fine no way is better than the other way I really don't care how you do it what I care about is can you follow me can you guys do it from here to there and get the right signs in the right places where have be okay with that I know it's basic algebra but you know what that's our main struggle basically in calculus is basic algebra so you okay with it you sure okay okay now I'm going to answer Scott's question Scott's question was since I made this a u do I make this a u and the answer is well let's let's look at your substitution you you have to find a place for this right do you notice how this has an X if I make this into a u watch what would happen watch by the way this is 2 < TK X du = DX you guys see that right look what would happen if I do cosine U over U cosine U over U I can't just make this a du even if I did it wouldn't work because we don't have cosine U over U that doesn't work you can't make it co U to the 1 time cosine U and split it up so you don't even know how to take U to the ne 1 because it's lnu we're not even in that part of the class so we can't do that one anyway but this is this would not be du it would be 2un X du is there a place to get rid of the X what's the one necessity for substitution work got to get you got to have just use right just use and it has to fit your integration table otherwise you did something wrong or you haven't gone far enough now we did something wrong because we can't cross that out and that's a problem if you have two different variables that's typically a big problem for you you've gone you've done something a mistake in the previous problem now what I can tell you is this this was the correct substitution right DX was that so that's the correct substitution I know that picked my U here and that's the inside of something so that had to be right the only wrong part was probably this one and if I move it back to what it actually is the square root of x do you see how that's really going to help us out what's that going to do for us so that's gone hey now I'm good to go by the way that two is that a 1/2 or a two over one what does that so when I pull this out in front of my integral it's two cosine U du that's a pretty easy integral right there that's pretty easy one what's the integral of cosine U du positive or negative signi very good you can think of it so s u this equals 2 sin U that is 2 sin let's go ahead and substitute back in for What U is look like square root of x put a plus c behind it and you are done we still feeling okay okay tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to give you one to do on your own uh we'll kind of go back and forth like that hopefully for a little while um I'll give you one and maybe I'll help you with the next one but I want you to mostly do it uh let's see if you can you can manage to do this one go ahead and follow the process down to find it of you it looks horrible it's going to look horrible it's not going to be horrible though as long if you follow this this process there you go really it looks bad doesn't it a little it's not bad it really isn't the hardest ones are trig ones uh manipulating trig identities to get something to fit your integration table that's the hardest for us it's either I mean if it's not true it's shoot it's a it's a finite integration table it has to fit so if it doesn't fit directly by breaking up fractions and combining like terms or something or separating integrals uh then it has to fit with a substitution if it's not those two things it's not going to be in here we can't do it I why don't you give it a try I want you to find your U I'll put the U up on the board here in just a second take to take the derivative both sides do your substitution and see what happens remember it's up to you to find your you you got you guys got to be able to do that I can't just walk you through it all the time when I pick my hue should I pick it with the cube root or without the cube root without definitely without definitely without with with the cube root it's a chain rule very hard to do uh you have some crazy stuff going on definitely without did you pick that as your U it's inside something the derivative is kind of up there not really because you had a constant but kind of up there it's good good sign derivative oh man uh 25x 4th orative 25x better not lose that negative oh goodness let's do a little dividing now we're going to go real slow this is not the time to take it quick and make a mistake by doing the math in your head it's time to write it out and really get the hand handle of this stuff all right not not doing everything all fancy Dancy I know there's an X to 4th I'm going to leave it a cube root for right now I'm going to make it a u in there did you make it that far wait now you if you did you actually made it that far yes these two rows yes the DX the DX is Du over - 25x to 4 right here you should be able to tell whether you made the correct substitution or not don't Hammer at this thing if you made the wrong substitution should be apparent to you uh did you make the right substitution yeah how do you know that's great that's what you want to have happen so X's are gone if that happens most likely you made the right choice are there times when you didn't there's times you have to go further yeah but for us most of the time this works okay let's make things a little bit better tell me what I do with the -25 and becomes what negative something right -1 25th whatever that is I don't really care how about the the cube root of U is it U to the 3 U to the2 what is that 13 very good and then then du we made our substitution no problem we kept it a cube root okay we kept x to the 4th we don't change that yet we made our DX exactly what we solved for not a big deal crossed out our x to the four that's great pull out the 1 over-25 made 125th perfect we have a cube root into a 1/3 power and now we have something that fits our integration table and it it looked nasty easy that's easy has to be easy has to put your integration table if it's not easy you did something wrong it's not necessarily true some of them kind of get a little bit nastier but for the for the most part that's true folks oh by the way this a good time to tell you this when you do an integral you don't write the integral anymore so I'm not going to do this I'm not going to write U to the what is 1 plus that uh 4/3 over 4/3 over one over 34 you don't keep writing that integral it's like taking a square root of something right if you do this and you take the square root of 49 you don't write the square root of seven at least I hope you don't write that you just write seven right when you're done with the square root you're done with square root when you're done with integral you're done with the integral you don't keep writing it just like a derivative you want to keep writing a derivative now let's make this side a little bit better we got -1 over 25 we have 3 U 4/3 over 4 you see how to flip that up or you could do 34 you could so we're going to go ahead and multiply that that's going to be -3 U to the 4/3 over looks like 100 plus C we don't have to do it quite yet if you want to that's fine uh just make sure you have it at the end of your problem all right so right now there's one more thing I need be even before a plus c if if you want yeah we don't want to end in u what you can do you can go one more step on this thing and put it back into radical notation if you would like that will be -3 a cube root 3 - 5x 5 all to 4th power all over 100 plus C I was waiting for yes no yeah you get have the3 over 100 times that whole thing what I really care about is do you see I mean when you get get really good at derivatives you've been doing this for a while you can see it even better but do you see that this is the derivative of that you see some things coming out of that 4/3 goes down to 1/3 mhm derivative of the inside is something X 4th there's just something X 4th that 25 that's going to it's going to simplify down to that so that is going to work that's a nice way to kind of check your work is with the derivative you having fun yet yes this is like the uh the pure non theory part of this class right this is like we're just hammering down on some problems right now which I guess can be kind of fun we get theory part uh probably next time where we're going to find out why this is the way that it is because I said so that's your theory behind three way to do things right way WR way Mr the way how they discovered the term for the right way all right so integral of x^2 < TK xus one now now this one might trick you if you really don't listen to what I what I said before this one might trick you here's why it might trick you I said two things have to happen first you pick your U so it makes it easier you pick your U because it's typically the inside of something and you pick your U where the derivative is there that's where the problem might come in here because and it goes in the order which I told you uh it goes in the order of pick it make it easier pick it make it on inside of something pick it so the derivative is there now is this on the inside of something the derivative is not really there cuz that's the inside of something that's a problem now I pick this as my U my derivative is just one that doesn't take care of the X squ so this is kind of something we're like oh my gosh I have no idea pick something pick something and pick something that's the inside that's the best way to start if you pick the inside do you notice how you don't know how to take the integral of the sare root of x - one right but you do know how to take the integral of square root of U you with me on that if that's U to the 1/2 that fits that's how you pick your U so here you are right let's go ahead and pick our u x -1 are you okay with this so far right du is what 1 DX or in other words simply DX you feel okay you sure now we're going to do some fancy map fancy map is X2 still there is a square root still there is the xus one still there what is it it is me and is the DX still there no is D what's the problem on our problem we have X yeah you know what's not cool about integrals is you can't pull out like an X squ that just doesn't work right because otherwise these problems will all be very very easy otherwise you can just separate them here and that would be nice but you can't you have to make everything either all x's and work or use and work the problem is this is our problem that X squ right there this is nice this is nice that's great that's our problem how do we deal with our problem well maybe you see it do you see anything we can do we could kind of maybe manipulate the substitution we have to fit that so for instance look at our our substitution it's U equal xus one you follow here's the logic here I hope you can follow this the logic is what if I can somehow make another substitution for X2 if I can do that maybe it'll work I don't know but we we're trying here but maybe we can do that so so look up here in our board we got we got u = x -1 what I want you to do do when you whenever you get this case and you know you made the only substitution you can make right that's the only one you can make that's it no other substitution would be even close to good you know make the only one try to do another form of substitution over here so for instance I want to get an X squ let's make this somehow an X squ tell me what I have to do probably solve for x first would be a great idea let's add one if you add one do you see that you get X = U + 1 follow me on that X = U + 1 how do you get x^2 out of X that is an equation isn't it if I Square both sides yeah that works that works you okay with that one note that if you distribute this you get u^2 + 2 U + 1 you still okay should we distribut yes uh notice there's no DX there's no du there's nothing because we haven't done derivatives here all we're doing is making a direct statement of what x^2 is in terms of you and we got that from our substitution by show at hands tell feel okay with what we we've just done have I lost you at all we're okay okay let's see what we have instead of X2 I've already solved for X2 I've got u^2 plus 2 U + one what must absolutely must why because we have multiplication and you got square root of U probably a great thing to do at this point would be change that into an exponent U ^2 + 2 U + 1 * u^ 12 power to you now why did I do that why why is this going to work for us what can you do if you distribute everything's in terms of Ed right can't you use those exponents to your advantage now notice what we can't do we can't just take an integral right here we can't take an integral right now we would have to absolutely distribute that so when we do recall that you add exponents when you multiply so this is going to be U to the 5 Hales this will be 2 U to the 3es plus u to the 12 du did I do my math right on that can you take an integral of that one very easily each one of those fits remember we're going to stop right in our integral if we manipulate those fractions what I'm looking at is 2 U 7es over 7 plus 4 notice the 2 * 2 U to the 5 halfes over five plus 2 U to the three halfes over three we're very close to done what's the last thing we got to do subtitute back yeah we got to make sure we're in terms of X not U put a plus c at the end and we will be done so final answer what was it x - one now you can make those all Roots if you'd like to they're all square roots of x -1 to some power uh you can leave them as as fractions I really don't care as long as you make that far that's great that's what I care about how many people feel they can make it that far good now we have a couple more minutes let me show you one more example uh we'll finish this off next time but I want to St just talk about the first step what's a good choice for your U is it 2 - x is it including the square root is it the 2x^2 - 8x + 1 yes probably if it's going to be anything it's probably that you don't want to pick just a little piece of that if you're going to pick something pick the whole thing inside right not the not the whole thing include the square root but the whole inside part for sure if we were to pick that which is really if you can see it you kind of get an understanding of this substitution thing that really is your only even close to good choice here you with me now the problem is if I take you for this is my derivative of this up there what is my derivative DX like that right make sure you have parentheses around that my question is this can you make this thing look like this thing factor out not a four not a four if you factor out of four please watch if you factor out of four you get x - 2 does that match up no those are not the same4 oh but Factor out4 negative positive or in other words that does that match up now that's great that's what you want to have happen so the reason why I give you these last four examples is to show you that your U might still work even though it's not maybe completely obvious to you you you think through it you might have to manipulate just little pieces of it and then it it works perfect remember it has to work perfect otherwise you can't do a substitution so it's somehow manipulate it work with it don't just give up on it oh we'll finish this one off next time and uh two more so we're going to continue finishing up this problem uh what we're what we're seeing is how to do substitution even when it doesn't look like maybe you can do a substitution sometimes you can so all you got to do is just try it out now last time I believe we were talking about picking this is our our U and seeing if a substitution will work when you pick your substitution again it has to be on the inside of something and typically everything as far as driva goes must also be in your integral disregarding the constant so here we're going to have a du = 4x - 8 DX we all know how to do that the problem is that's not directly in your integral so you're going to have to manipulate at least some order to make this thing work now one thing people suggested was what if we were to factor out the four if we factor out the four you got x - 2 DX that looks pretty close pretty close but it's not exactly right and it's got to be exactly right for you to eliminate it you follow me so what was the suggestion someone else gave after this maybe instead of four yeah the4 because what the4 would do factor4 out changes that to a and that to a plus and if I just reorder it a little bit I get 2 - x DX so far so good of course we can solve for DX and now we're finally ready to do our substitution if we do the substitution here we'll get do we still have a 2 - x on the numerator yeah you still have a 2 - x on the numerator that's not something we've gotten rid of yet remember the only things you can get rid of is whatever you're calling your U and whatever youve solved for DX that's the only two things you really substitute in for everything else should take care of itself really so here we haven't touched that yet that's 2 - x the square root should the square root still be there what's inside of the square root those are entire you you're right and then should DX still be there no yeah DX no we'll make that substitution that nice jump it's also nice that we made it look exactly the same here that way it's very easy to see what we can and what we can't do with our problem now so what can you do that's completely gone on what do you do with the4 okay so I'm going to make itative 1/4 if that's okay with you guys what else would you like to do turn your square root of U into a u to thetive one2 okay so the square root itself turns into a 1/2 but then to move it to the numerator that's where it becomes negative so yeah you're absolutely right we're going to make this4 we haven't done anything with that integral of that's U to the -2 du from here it fits our table perfectly that's great because if it didn't we'd have to do more work we don't want to do more work make it as easy as possible then do your integral then re substitute back in from U Back Into terms of X and you're done so in our we've got the 1/4 still hanging on We've Got U to the what's that going to be 12 over over2 yeah exponent over new exponent still okay you sure this 1/4 and that 1 12 notice that really this two is going to go up to that numerator because you you separate reciprocate and multiply you get I I'll show you both steps here you'd get /4 * 2 U to the2 like that well this is going to simplify -2 U to the2 or you could have it U to the2 over 2 netive U the2 over 2 that's fine what we got to do now is what yeah so I'll make it -2 U becomes whatever we had for a substitution that's 2x^2 - 8x + 1 to the 1/2 power what's the 1/2 power again so could you write this as a square root instead of that 1/2 sure you could that's fine plus C show up hands how we will K with this so far are you getting the hang of the substitution hopefully after the practice last night then you you have at least a great idea on what's going on the last one we're going to talk about is this one I'll give you one more trig one because I know you guys love it so much right oh yeah thank you you wel that's a good one why is that a good one cuz right now you're looking at it and you're stumped right cuz I would be if I was in your seat I wouldn't know what to do we could try some things you could try picking X that's not really going to help right just changes cosine Cub of x to cosine Cub of U to U that doesn't really do much we try P picking cosine X right because it's cosine X to the thir power true but the derivative of cosine X is sin x is there sin x up there then that would be a problem when if you come around this this situation you know that the derivative of cosine is basically s negative but basically s if you ignore the constant and the derivative of s is cosine right you're going to have to have both those things up there so when we have a cosine cubed and there's no sign that's going to be really hard to deal with if we don't have a sign because as soon as you pick some U with a that has a trig you're going to have a derivative that has some trig in it right it's got to be up there somewhere here's maybe a way to deal with this break off something that you know has an identity to it for instance cosine Cub I don't know any identity with that but I do know an identity with coine s squar maybe break out the cosine squar see what happens is it in the cosine squared going to give you a s squared in there somewhere yeah we'll see we'll see what happens well that was relatively painless cosine s time cosine is still cosine Cub so that works now I still can't pick that as a u because the derivative of cosine is not cosine so I got to change this into a sign somehow and then we'll take our Ru how much is cosine squar cosine there's no identity with that right but cosine squar has an identity what is cosine squ very good you use the Pythagorean theorem uh the Pagan identity for um s and cosine I mean and what this says is that instead of cosine squ sure why don't you make it 1us sin s x which is true because of sin 2 X plus cosine s x equals 1 subtract one of the other and you have uh the alternate trade function that you're looking for do you feel okay so far now let's think about this think about it what should your U be what should your you be are you saying wait wait I'll give you options your only op there's four options one two of them are not good options option number one is to five options I guess well you can really screw this thing up option number one is picking X for you no not going to do anything option number two is picking cosine X for you this is going to hurt you with that right because you can't directly just cross out that sign you can't do that and you still have a s x there still have a sign X that would be a problem you see the problem bad option option number three picking the whole entire thing here picking the whole entire thing you pick the whole entire thing you got to take the derivative of the whole entire thing it has to show up der of the whole entire thing is a general power rule you see general power rule there 2 sinx cosine X does that appear no bad option option number four picking just this part sin 2 x is that a good option again you have to take the derivative of that that's 2 sin x cosine X that's not up here again you pick the inside thing remember that this is sin x^2 right you with me this is this the the U's are inside of something you rarely rarely take a u that has a function and a power that's too much cuz when you take the the derivative it's a chain rule if you're having to take a chain rule for your derivative of U you might have picked the wrong U do you see what I'm talking about because you're going to get that function back again and it has to appear exactly in your integral that's often times not going to happen so this whole thing no no because that's a chain rule or general power rule however you want to say it this thing Ah that's the inside is the derivative of s x in your integral then that's the correct U what is the derivative of sinx is it positive or negative cosine I still have some people giving me negatives be careful on what you're doing integrals versus derivatives this is a derivative derivative of sin x is positive cosine X DX when you divide by cosine you get du over cosine x equals DX hey we're we're almost good to go let's check this thing out we've got integral of 1 what's the sin x going to become for us folks did we sell the square yes so you didn't even have to deal with the square right u^ squ is easy you didn't have to pick the whole thing because you can take an integral of U2 that's great do I still have a cosine X right here uh at this point yes at this point absolutely ideal do I still have a DX it is instead our substitutions du over cosine X does something nice happen nice awesome now I do know it's easier when I do it than when you do it at home right you probably spend 20 minutes on that problem which is okay but you're going to start learning some of these things as you go on I I think I gave you some hints of the begin of the problem when you have trig functions the derivative has to be there so break up some things see if you can make it see if you can work with it this one's turned out to be so nice 1 - u^2 du that's not bad not bad at all can take the integral of 1 - u^2 du fits perfectly in an integration table what's the integral of one tell me that x no not X U yes why U and not X because at your variable you're integrating with respect you that's why the D whatever is important U minus what don't get confused I know it's confusing you're going between derivatives and integrals and we're doing them the same problem right derivative of sign and then you're going to take integral of oh man be careful don't rush think through it so far okay at the end sub you can add it here I don't care substitute in yes so you was right here sinx sin cubed x over 3 plus that's what you need do you feel with it it's going to take a while to master it right yes practice a lot of practice uh but it's possible you know you you guys have the the fundamentals down you understand the substitution that's really all there is to it as far as substitution goes the substitution part is pretty easy right it's making it fit the substitution that's a little bit harder sometimes but work with it especially the trig ones get through that stuff get over the hump and then you'll you'll be okay with it this the last example as far as substitution I'm going to give you are there any questions before we move on all right [Music]
