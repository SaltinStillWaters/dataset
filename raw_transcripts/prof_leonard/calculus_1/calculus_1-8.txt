Transcript for: Calculus 1 Lecture 1.5:  Slope of a Curve, Velocity, and Rates of Change
now are you ready to learn how we can take limits and use them first I've already kind of shown you a basic idea of how to do this how to find this the slope of a curve at a point would you like to learn how to do it for real using limits are you sure the answer is yes otherwise you get to leave the class because this is where Calculus is going now so would you like to learn it yeah otherwise you're not going to learn calculus you're going to learn well just basic algebra and limits that's all we've done so far ready to learn calculus should jumpy you can watch that again on YouTube maybe you don't want to it's too scary you never seen a grown man get excited about calculus before come on people that's well first time for everything 1.5 we're going to talk about tangent lines we're going to apply them to rates of change and you're going to see that we can take our idea of limits and turn it into a tangent line and turn it into a rate of change it's going to be kind of an interesting idea I I need you to follow through this is like a kind of a not really a proof it's kind of a semi- proof we're going to be creating creating the slope of a curve at a point I I'll give you a definition for how we say the slope of a curve at a point in the next section for right now this is what we're doing though the first part of calculus what we want to do is find the tangent to a curve right in order find a tangent of a curve you need a slope and a point the point's going to be given what we want to be able to do is find the slope of a curve at a point that's our whole idea so that's why we'll be talking about tangent lines and then rates of change follows directly from that so we're going to use limits to find the slope of a tangent line to a curve at a point I'm going to actually write that down so you understand what we're doing again in calculus a lot of people get halfway through and they forget what it is they're actually doing they just get caught up in the formulas and doing the math and they're not really focusing on what you're doing what we're doing anytime we do this process we're finding the slope of a curve at a point or the slope of a tangent line to a curve at a point so we're using limits to find the slope of a tangent line to a curve at a point let me say of the tangent line that folks is the first idea the first problem in calculus we're going to create it from scratch so I I want you to understand where this is coming from some of you will have seen part of this formula before in your um pre-calculus class some of you might have seen it in your intermediate algebra class it's going to look familiar wait a second that's why we did that because at the time you're like what the what the heck is this why are we using you're going to see why you're using that so we're going to invent this formula together that way you see where it's coming from would you like to do that yeah brother I just give it I hated that I want you to see where it's coming from and understand it part of math isn't just doing the math it's understanding it that way you have a better understanding later on so here here's our creation our idea again I'm going to draw my same curve I did before we want to find the slope of this curve at some point and I'm going to call it P again what was the other point that I used q q yeah now our idea was that we're going to take q and have it really really close to P right right that was the idea of a limit really really close without touching it that's the idea here now what we're going to do is Define this a little bit differently than I did before you see we are going to find the slope of the secant line that's the line that connects those two points but here's how I'd like to do it the first thing I want to do is say Okay p is some point let's call it x sub Z just my my point and it's fixed it's my actual solid point x sub zero you okay with this so far let's see is that straighter or less straight is that horrible is that that's better it looks am I wearing different Siz shoes or something like this that's horrible okay X Sub 0 and this point over how far is that how far is that well you can't say oh is seven well there's no actual value right we're doing this in general we don't want to use a different variable we want it based on this one but here's how I'm going to do it I want to say okay this this is x sub Z plus a little teeny bit are you with me on that plus a little teeny bit here's why I want to do the plus a little teeny bit uh because I want to introduce the limits to you right now because if if I do plus a little teeny bit and I take that little teeny bit and I let it go to zero think about this for a second if I let the little teeny bit go to zero that squeezes Point Q all the way over to point P do you see it if I let it approach zero so here's how we're going to Define it we're not going to call it anything else we're going to say this is x sub 0 plus a little bit and H is that little bit now keep in mind this is not to scale okay what we actually are doing is p and Q are so are going to become so close to each other that it's no difference okay are you ready to find out this the height let's figure out those two points how high is point P can you tell me that f p yeah let's assume this function is f then that would be F of what now no not P not p f Sub Zero because that's our x coordinate for p so far so good how about the the top point R CU sure we know to find out the height of our function we just plug in our x coordinates how that's how functions work so we now have this thing what we want to do remember our idea is this never forget the idea we want to find the slope of the tangent line to a a curve at a point our point is point P right now are you with me on that we want to find the slope of this curve at Point P basically is what we're doing so this is our Point what we're going to do with that though is well we need how many points to make a line how many points to find the slope you don't have to whisper it how many two two yes you're all right you need two yeah you need two points say proudly two points yeah you need two so we have these two points but our idea is let's just take Point q and put it a little bit past Point P you follow me on that because ultimately we're going to take this distance and make it zero or make it approach zero not equal zero because then we would have two points anymore we're going to make it approach zero that means get really really close and that's the idea of a limit do you see why we had to have limits before we could do this idea okay well let's go keep going let's find some slope out why don't you tell me what is slope oh very good okay rise over but give me another way you would do it very good okay change in you have it backwards but change in there you go the change in y over the change in X let's find out the change in y and the change in X can you tell me our change in y goes from point P to point Q how far is that or in other words how could I figure it out okay let me give you some okay hang on this is 10 this is three how far is it between them very good how'd you do it subtracted 3 - 10 or 10 - 3 hopefully 10 - 3 the big oneus the small one right so how we do this is we go okay well this is not not 10us 3 it is do it again for me very good this value and you could use parentheses if you want but it's not it's not necessary here x Sub 0 plus h- X Sub 0 will give you the distance between it this is all of X Sub 0 plus h minus X Sub 0 will give you the distance between those two x values now if you're still okay with that it's kind of a big one okay do the math what's this going to be H that is H that's just H well that should make sense I mean how far apart is x sub Z from x sub Z Plus H it's just H right it's just a little bit if H was two it would be two apart if H is 01 well then they're 01 apart it's just H just H now let's go ahead let's also find the rise how much is the rise F of h no not F of H not F of H if this was 10 and this was three the distance between them would be seven true now how did you do that subtract it so subtract it you know I'm going to do this over here so you can see it a little bit better this is f of x Sub 0 plus h right this is f of x Sub 0 so write that out don't do the math in your head just because you're making a mistake on that right now some of you I want you to write out exactly what it is write out exactly what I want you to do what is it f of x Sub 0 plus h that's the first value what what am I subtracting from that but show hands how many people feel okay I'm getting not only the H but now getting this rise feel all right with that yes no okay now where where did people go wrong and give me f of H can you subtract x sub 0us X Sub 0 answer is no you can't do that that's impossible you cannot combine those two things so this this is the function at this point this is the function at this point those are two distinct points right you can't subtract them and give me the function at the the difference between them that's completely the wrong wrong way to go right this would be the height at x sub that's that one this is the height of X Sub 0 plus h that's that's that one if you find F of h f of H is like way down here right H is just a little bitty point a little bitty sorry uh yeah F of H H is right here that's going to be very different than anything between those anything having to do with that you can't just subtract a function minus a function and subtract the the input values like that you can't do that okay so there's no way we can actually simplify that part of it do you agree nothing we can do with that however can you come up with the formula for a slope right now so we have slope is rise over run Delta y over Delta x what is our Delta Y in this case Zero yeah it's hard to say isn't it f of x that's why you get a master's degree you can say all this they teach you that's not what they teach you now f of x Sub 0 plus h sure minus f of x plus f of x Sub 0 so this right here is our Delta y this right here is our Delta X so right now we actually have the formula for slope but I need you to understand where that comes from are you okay where that this is in fact the rise and this is in fact the Run are you okay with that do you see where it's where it's coming from on on your graph does that look familiar have you ever heard of the difference quotient before that's the difference quotient you might have had that in your pre-calculus I'm sure you had that in your pre-calculus class they did a lot of work with that right why because we're now going to extrapolate from that and gets the slope of a curve at a point cool now here's the deal what we've done right now is we have the slope sure but is it the slope of a tangent or the slope of a secant okay secant yes see we have the slope between these two actual fixed points right now yes what what we want to do is just what we did like the first couple days of of this calculus course not the review but the calculus part of this we want let Point Q get really close to point p and I've said it before in here but how are we going to do that we can't change x sub Z that's fixed okay what are we going to do to let this get close to that what happens does H get bigger does H get smaller how much smaller infinitely smaller so infinitely close to in other words that means let H approach zero so what we're going to do is we're we're going to make so this is a seant right now in order to get the tangent we're going to make Point Q get close to point P make Q get really close to point B Point P how you might ask well we're going to take that H we're going to make it close to zero that says the distance between them is very very very small well tell me something I can't just say oh yeah I'm going to make H zero I have to introduce something that we've had in this class before what allows you to take a value a variable and move it close to a number what was that it's called the limit so here's how we make the jump from a secant which is what this is that's just the slope of you could do this with any line it's going to find the slope for any point that's what it is if you know the distance points that's what that is saying okay that is the slope formula it's just a different way to write it how we make the the jump from this secant to the tangent that I'm going to write over here is is we're going to let H approach zero that involves the limit that's why we had to have limits so this one's the secant we want the slope of the tangent line the slope of the tangent line is going to look almost identical it's going to have the f of x Sub 0 plus h minus of x0 all over H only now what do we want the H to do so we need a limit as I could have just given you that right and said that's slope of tangent line but do you see what's happening here do you see how this this is the slope of any two points that that I want okay this is the slope and this is the distance between those two points and what this says is I'm making that distance get really close to zero can it ever equals zero No in fact if you plug in zero what happens you get something undefined why why does that happen it says well if you only have one point I.E you let it go to zero and get there you only have one point right can you find the slope of one point that doesn't make any sense so you can't let it get to zero that's why we had to use the limit and say we're approaching zero where the the distance between those numbers doesn't make that much of a significant difference but there is a small small difference that's all we had to have that limit idea would you like to see an example about how to actually use this for sure I would hope so it's kind of interesting right we just kind of proved that you can find a slope of a curve at a point isn't that that's kind of neat I know we've done it one time before but it took a whole lot of work now we're going to minimize our work I hope so let's try this we've done this example we did it the long way now we're going to have a nice easier way to do this so find the equation I'm sorry of the tangent line to Y = X2 at the point right now I'm going to give you an actual point that's how I've defined our function x sub Z is the actual value it's a fixed point of X okay it says you have an x value of this number in the future I'm not going to give you that we're gonna be able to find the slope at any point and that's even more cool even more cooler at one one but the first thing we got to do we got to figure out what all this stuff is and where you start is you got to Define your function so in our case what is f ofx what are we going to treat as F ofx good that's important for you to know that because we're going to be referring back to x squ a lot right now also you need to identify what is x sub Z for this specific case in our case what is the x coordinate that's our X of the fixed point one so X Sub 0 in our case is one says you're starting at the0 one are you guys all right with that not because this is the one that would be the output that would be f of x of0 or that that that's what we get when we plug in one but the X Sub 0 is one that's the x coordinate have our fixed point you okay with this so far now I'm going to encourage you to do a couple things before you just blindly plug the stuff in I want you to find the f of x Sub 0 plus h and the f of x Sub 0 independently so in our case we want to find f of x Sub 0 + H tell me what was X Sub 0 again so we want to find X Sub 0 Plus plus h but X Sub 0 is 1 I want to find F of what 1 plus h make the jump from X Sub 0 to what your your value actually is for X Sub 0 did you follow that one so this is 1 + H give you a head on if you see where the one is coming from good all right also we want f of x Sub 0 f of x Sub 0 is really F of what very good so short little recap we identify our function we identify the point those two things are there this right here is your formula to find the slope of a tangent line that's it all you've got to be able to do H is not going to change you just need to find this thing and this thing accurately plug it in and find your limit this is going to incorporate a lot of things we've done in this class already so f of x Sub 0 plus h that is f of 1 + h f of x Sub 0 that is f of 1 because X Sub 0 is 1 you with me let's start on the easy part what's F of one say to do one yeah plug in one where are we going to plug in one yeah so plug in one how much is that going to give you 1 s is one sure in fact it should give it to you right here right cuz that is the output I mean should give it to you if it gives you the whole point that's even easier if it says as at x equals a number well then yes you actually have to plug it in on your own now how about F of 1 + H what do you do with that turn into a pol turn it into what do you mean plug it into F you know what this meant this meant plug in one right you know what this means plug in one plus h I always told my students I said look at this thing is non-separable you can't do this what please watch on the board common mistake all the time when you first learn this especially compositions if you struggle with that people go okay this is f okay I want F ofx I want to do 1 plus h so they'll give me this uh let's do 1^ 2 + H CU that's F of 1 plus h do you see the mistake this isn't one F of one plus h that'd be written like this that's what that would be that is that okay this isn't F of one plus h it's F of 1 plus h okay you can't separate it it's like one thing for you right whatever I have in there that's what you're plugging in you don't do F of one plus h you do F of 1 plus h like it's one word do you get it you cannot separate it so in our case we're not doing 1 plus h no no no no no no we're doing F of 1 plus h so what's that going to be 1 H 1 + h s do you see how to get from here to here are you sure not F of one plus oh please please don't do that it's never going to work for you if you do that never oh my gosh that would be horrible well now all we've got to do is take these quantities that you just figured out substitute them into my formula for my slope of the tangent line and we'll be done more or less that more or less it's scary yeah no it's it's less it's stuff you've already done very easy so instead of x sub z f of x0 plus h I've already figured that out that was 1 + h^2 that's what I'm going to put first minus instead of f of x Sub 0 what did I work that out to you that's what I have you do off the side right you just break it down piece by piece that's okay F of 1 + H was 1 + h 2 F of 1 is 1 all over how much oh don't forget that H don't forget that H okay and now here's where you try to plug in the number because this is a limit now right this is just a limit which we've already conquered those sections you plug in zero can you plug in zero you get oh 0 over zero right that's a problem don't you or you something over zero looks like 0 over Z to me so oh we need to do something else then why don't we figure out what this is so let's go ahead distribute that combine some like terms and see what happens don't forget to write the limit let's see that's 1 + 2 H + h^ 2 - 1 over H did you get the same thing when you distributed as well what happens here the ones the ones are gone okay I like that that's great so that is the limit as H goes to zero of 2 H + h^2 over H oh man if I plug in zero right now it's still going to 0 over z uh what's another thing that I might be able to do do you remember when we whenever we had a 0 over Z typically what you do is you factor right and that sometimes most of the time will work your problem out for you that's what we're doing here now is it a problem for our domain that we'll be Crossing out a zero over zero no are we actually letting H get to zero just approach zero so that's fine we can do that and this is your process for find the slope of ctive Point what you ultimately want to do you want to cross out this INE that's your that's pretty much your goal that's it as soon as you get rid of that you'll be fine plug in the number so here we have h 2 + H over H are you okay on the factorization can we cross our H's out notice how we don't need to get rid of all our hes right just the one that's causing us the problem just that one notice how I'm still writing the limit anytime you have an H you're going to write the limit now am I okay to evaluate this limit as H goes to zero now we're fine we have no issues now you stop writing the limit you write 2 + 0 2 plus 0 is of course two two okay that's kind of cool what's the slope of that curve at the 0.11 two you just found it you found the slope of that curve at that point and now it made a whole lot more sense because we got to use limits with it so the slope of that tangent line is two can you find the equation to the line what do you need to find the equation for the line you need two things always to find the equation of a line point of slope do we have a point what's the point okay do we have a slope we do now because we just use limits to find one that's kind of neat and we'd use the slope now the point slope formula y - y1 m x - X1 why don't you plug that in there and see what you get okay you can all do that what you just found on your paper if you did that by yourself what you just found on your paper is a slope of a tangent line to the curve X2 at a point that's the only tangent line that's going to exist at that point now here's my question is the tangent line going to be different for a different point for instance if I give you the point 2 comma 4 are you going to have a different slope it's a it's a it's a parabola right yeah it has a different slope at every single point every Point has a different slope so yeah it's going to be different you going have to redo this every single time ultimately I'm going to find I'm going to give you a way so that you can find the equation for a for the slope of a tangent line that's going to be a little bit better so we'll do that at the end I just want to get you this picture in your head cuz I've actually given you this example before do you remember it I did that example for you I did it a long way though it was it was a ways back but now we have a better way using limits and we didn't have to make that jump we didn't have to make the limit jump because now we Define limits we can actually use that let's go ahead and start one more I want to get the first couple pieces of this down and then we will uh we'll continue next time so next up isn't that neat though you found the slope of a curve at a point I think that's so cool that's why I love this class to do some neat stuff let's find the equation of the tangent line to this curve at the point let's see uh 31 I want to make sure the idea sticks in your head so firstly what are we doing what's the what are we what are you trying to find SL slope of the tangent line to this curve at that specific point so we are going to be using that formula again what I want you to do see if you can find the two pieces that I need first how about f of x Sub 0 plus h in this case can you tell me what is x sub 0 please is it the three or the one it's a three it's the x value so x sub Z is three so instead of X Sub 0 plus h we're going to be finding F of what plus h 3 plus h so 3 plus h right it's it's one thing find F of 3 + H so I want that I know that sorry I'll write up here x of 0 = 3 FX = 3x that's always our first step find X Sub 0 and find your F ofx but now what I'd like you to do in the last few seconds here find F of 3 + H find F of 3 that will take care of your X Sub 0 + H and your F ofx Sub 0 did you already find that as I was talking firstly are you okay that x sub Z is in fact three yes or no are you okay okay that f ofx is 3x so we have we have those two things set in stone if you want to find this do the easy one first F of 3 that just means plug in three you should get that value again if it gives you a point because that is the output for that number so we should get 3 over3 or simply one did you all get one okay that's the easy one now the other one F of 3 + H is it going to be 3 over well what is it going to be are you going have have the H at the end or within the function it's it's 3 plus h right non-separable so this is 3 over what that's exactly right how many people have exactly that good for you okay I'll show you what to do with that next time we'll actually find the slope of that curve at that point all right so let's continue this problem we're talking about how to find tangents to Curves at certain points which in in of itself is a very interesting question specifically here we're trying to find the tangent line to this curve at that specific point and I've walked you through this already what we're trying to do is fill out the difference quotient which you guys are familiar with and then take a limit as H approaches zero in other words letting one point get really really really really close to this point therefore we have a tangent line to that curve at that point so we're almost there we have we have our F of 3 plus h we have our F of three and we're trying to find out as H approaches Z what this thing is going to be that's what we dealt with last time you remember inventing that last time I hope yes okay so we already have this part we already have this part let's make our substitution and then let's see what we can do with it so if we have this we'll have our our limit as H approaches zero notice you have to keep writing your limit until your limit is gone that's a must of instead of f of 3 + H please tell me quickly what am I going to have instead of f of 3 + H okay are you okay on the 3 over 3 + H yes now you see where that's coming from so instead of f of 3 + H I have well what that equals 3 over 3 + H then am I going to have a plus or minus what do you think yeah the formula says minus minus how much yeah F of three is one all over what folks don't forget that H so we've just made a little substitution we've have 3 over 3 + H for our F of 3 + H cool minus minus F of 3 well that is our one so here's our limit as H goes to zero raise your hand feel all right with that so far good all right now quick question can I cross out the three you know I see a lot of people love to do that right you go fast like oh the threes are the same I get to cross them out yay no not so much we can't cross them out because that's a term right that's not a factor we cannot simplify that in any way shape or form so how in the world are we supposed to get this H crossed out that's our ultimate goal because right now if we plug in h we're going to get Z over zero do you see it that's going to happen all the time if you let H go to zero because what this is is the slope between two points if you let H go to zero well you only have one point if you let it equal zero we're letting it approach zero so we are going to have two points but we need to find a way to manipulate this so we can cross out our H's so we don't have an issue with this any ideas denominator what now common denominator common denominator would be great because right now I have a complex fraction I have a fraction over well a fraction I need to make it one fraction over one fraction that way I can I can still work with it so so what's our LCD our common denominator going to be yeah when you only have one denominator it's that so instead of one notice you're still writing limit I have 3 over 3 + H minus instead of having one would you be okay if I put 3 + H over 3 + H is that the same thing sure yeah may as well one becomes that that is still one I'm just writing a special so I have a common denominator well if we continue well let's see what happens we've got a limit still H is still going to zero on the numerator oh let's check it out on the main numerator I know that I have a common denominator of 3 + H notice when you add or subtract fractions you do not change the denominator on the numerator what am I going to have Oh wrong say it again why is that minus important it's not really important right right or yes yes no it's not like we're talking about slope or anything right oh wait huh that's exactly what we're talking about so if you have your sign wrong your line goes from this to this or this to this is that big difference big difference freaking huge difference right you can't do that so get your signs right what's actually happening here is you have a parentheses around that that's what happens with any rational expression and this says you have 3 - 3 minus h- H yes no okay all over h that minus is important so we'll have a limit it's still a limit H is going to zero we have H over 3 + H all over H okay what now what do you want to do now okay do we have complex fraction sure we have one fraction over one fraction change that maybe into a fraction make it h over one you can do that right then what you'll see is I have one fraction divided by another fraction how you divide fractions is you reciprocate the second fraction and multiply do you see it you have one fraction divided by one fraction you reciprocate and then multiply so that'll be h/ 3 + H time I'm going to do this all at one step I'm going to reciprocate and multiply Time 1 over H times 1 over H are you okay on where the one over H is coming from are you sure so I'm reciprocating and multiplying what happens here yeah I don't want to distribute that H right because right now we have parentheses you were taught in your whatever class you learn this extend that line cross out those H's if you can because they're they're now factors what do I get on the numerator that negative oh that's important negative 1 so this is the limit this is the last time we'll write the limit for this problem -1 over 3 + H what duration if you can make it down that far you okay with this good deal that's great now wait a minute H is on the denominator can I plug in zero and be okay yes yes because I'm adding three to it that's fine if I evaluate this is where you stop writing the limit you say okay well this what this does this equals -1 over 3 + H oh sorry 3 + 0 because now we can let H go to zero now that we've eliminated that problem that's all right we can now evaluate that limit we know it's going to be continuous there's no problems there's no holes or ASM tootes at this point uh what's our answer what would you have gotten if you had forgotten to do this negative here positive 1/3 your is your tangent line going to be correct no no you would have the in inappropriate tangent line okay well that's all well and good are we done now this is kind of cool though what have you found what is this thing here always have that in your mind what you're doing you're finding slope this is the slope this is a slope of that curve this is a slope of that curve at that specific point do you follow me well that's convenient it's not coincidental but it's convenient because now we have the slope of this curve at that point we now have a point and the slope right what do you need to make the equation of a line point slope so we have that now I even gave you nice numbers what a nice guy I am look at that that's pretty cool are you okay on where the one the three and thetive 1/3 are coming from we're taking the point that that I've given you we're taking the slope that you have found and we're now making the equation of line that goes through that point with that slope not your if you're out with that one okay so we have our our min-1 that's -1 we have our 1/3 that's your slope we have our minus 3 that's the three if we distribute we'll get -3x and then what plus plus one very good we're almost done if we add one to it y = 13x + 2 very cool idea this line will intersect that curve at one spot and it's going to do it at that point so that is a tangent line to that curve at that point it's kind of a cool thing if you want to just talk about the slope of that curve at that point well that's the slope of the curve at the point if you want to graph a line that's the line it's kind of neat how many people feel okay with this so far now the next question is uh if I change points does my slope change does my equation change yeah they're all going to be different well that's going to be annoying because if I ask the next question okay find the line to the point uh let's see 9 1/3 then I ask how about uh 2 3 half then I ask some more you'd have to do this over and over and over and over again to find it for any point right maybe we can be a little bit smarter and do it once and for all perhaps we could find the equation for the slope and then just plug in the X values would you like to see a way to do that so in other words maybe I don't want to deal with a specific point I want to say I want to find the slope of this this function at any point that's I'm going to show you how to do now so let's find the slope of the tangent lines got my l find the slope of the tangent lines that just means the slope of the curve to Y = otk X at any point at any point well let's go through it you know that ultimately what we want to do is fill out this equation we know that slope equals the limit as H goes to zero f of x x Sub 0 plus hus f of x Sub 0 all over H you with me now X Sub 0 stands for a specific point does it not if we erase that F ofx Sub 0 we're going to find it for any point any point x you can use x sub Z if you want to I think the book uses that as well but you don't you don't necessarily have to be in general for any general point so well let's see can you tell me then let's let's figure these things out just like we did before can you figure out what f ofx is and what f of x plus h is let's try to let's try to fill this out then we'll make a small substitution to there just like we did right here and then we should be able to solve this thing out provided we can eliminate the H let's try that together so everyone let's look up here at the board uh what is our F ofx what's that do for us so what was it of X very good yeah that's because it says y = x that is our function so F ofx is X so far so good now how about f of x + h f ofx plus h is it f ofx + H like that is it f ofx plus H or is it f of x plus h so what that says to you is X Plus H you cannot separate right now what I've done is I've separated the X and the H do you see that this is not the square root this is not F ofx + h this is FX plus h how do I find let's compare it so this is wrong leave it on your paper just scratch that out that is not the correct thing what is the correct thing if I want to input all of X Plus H into my variable F ofx this is a composition folks you got to know how to do compositions that's why we spent some time on it earlier it's notun of X Plus H it's what x not just X Plus H [Music] that it's the square root sure and it says take this whole thing put it into the variable take the whole thing put it into the variable it's sare root of x + H notice the slight difference it doesn't look that different right but the square root stops here and it doesn't stop there this is the square root of x plus h how many people see the difference there and feel okay with it is it important to have that difference yeah it really is okay are we ready can we make the transition yeah we got we got everything we need we have f of x plus h got it we have f of x got it h doesn't change on your own why don't you plug that in make the substitution see what you get I'll do it on the board at the same time I always like to put this little tail on my square roots to show me where my square root stops that way I I know it's after the H I don't see I would hate for you to keep doing your steps right and this happens first step Second Step third step fourth oh now all of a sudden it's gone right that would suck or it get longer and longer and longer and it's covering the whole thing don't do that just make sure you know where your square root starts stops and and what it includes so f of x plus h great then we have a minus sign and we have FX F ofx was square root of x all over H you got that on your paper all right good deal now oh my gosh how do we solve it just give up let's just go home pointless anyway right now if you plug in zero you're going to get Z over zero you see it z z that's a problem so your whole goal here is to get rid of the H here that's your goal now there's of course ways to do it in fact I've shown you a problem quite simil to this with involving those square roots do you remember theate do you remember what the conjugate is whenever you have uh square roots like being subtracted or if square roots in any case you're taking a limit one great idea change the sign yeah change the sign multipli by the conjugate that's always a good idea to do do that right now multiply wait is it just the numerator or both the numerator and denominator both multiply it by the conjugate right now okay you're going to need to distribute the numerator but do not distribute the denominator you're trying to get rid of the H on the denominator if you distribute it you'll have to refactor it anyway hey does this sign change I know this one does does this sign change as well no no no okay good remember we have parenthesis here which means you're going to have to distribute and we have parenthesis here but what I told you is you don't want to distribute where you're trying to get rid of something right you're trying to get rid of that H so don't distribute that otherwise you'll have to refactor it so in our case our limit keep writing limit is denominator again keep it the same you'll see why in just a second but if you distribute the numerator correctly hopefully you got this no more Roots do you have any Roots then you probably did right numerator you're going to get X Plus H because the square root time itself gives you the radican that's the inside so we have our x + H that's great our middle terms are gone you're going to get plus rootx rootx plus h minus rootx rootx plus h it's fun to say and then lastly you're going to get minus X show hands how we made that far great what happens yeah we have positive x negative X that's kind of what you need Happ right geez I told you to get it out ahead of time what's the matter with the so those are gone do you need a tissue yeah yeah I don't have one thanks anybody it's fine good I don't think any else has you're so considerate thank you I care about my students you're paying my salary suckers no I'm just kidding totally joking I love you all uh anyway Please Subscribe 20,000 views is it 20,000 nothing want to get there personal go what happens now hes sure hes do you have anything left on the numerator one oh how sweet thank you so we have now a limit H goes to zero can we let the H go to zero and be okay if we do we get x + 0 which is still x square root of x that's okay plus that's okay so we're okay if we let the H go to zero what we end up getting is notice no more limit you have 1 over < TK x + 0+ < TK X no more limit because I allowed the H to go to zero when you're all said and done what is that going to what's it going to be I'll give you the one one over what two not not X right aunk of X plus a x doesn't equal x that's multiplied but a squ of X Plus X gives you what you just find what is this what's this weird thing that we just found SL oh this is a what that's a slope what you just found is a slope you found the slope of this where' it go you found the slope of that that's crazy look at that this thing right here is the slope it's a slope of this curve which looks like this thing that's how that curve looks it's half of a parabola on its side right what you've just done you've found the slope at any given point which is constantly changing that's pretty impressive so here's my my point could you find the slope at the point 4 comma 2 could you find the slope at the point 16a 4 9 three or or anything else for that matter could you find the slope of that sure even weird numbers find the slope of at the point uh s you could do it it'd be 1 over 2 * the of 7 you could find the slope at that all you got to do now is plug in the x coordinate it will give you the slope of that curve this curve at that point do you get the idea so if I say find the equation of tangent line now for these points well you can do it very easily so never forget that what we're actually doing we're finding the slopes of Curves this thing is the slope of that curve this this curve at any point x so if I had asked you this question so with a specific point you'd right now be plugging in which one the one or the three three You' be plugging in the three now of course 31 is not on this curve the point something like uh 255 is on that curve 25 is 5 so if I said find the slope of the curve at this point which one would you plug in 25 plug in 25 do I'll do it real quick what's square of 25 * 2 10 1110 very easy you just found the slope of this curve it's 1110 that's pretty flat right pretty flat but still positive 1110 could you find the equation of tangent line absolutely you have 1/10 X1 y1 plug it into that and now you have yourself the equation of the tangent line isn't that kind of neat kind of neat you don't have to do the actual specific point anymore you can find the equation of the tangent line Al together well at least the slow are there any questions before we go move on a little bit I want to show you a couple applications of this yeah that's good for the entire domain of this function right this is good for wherever the function is uh defined okay okay yeah now where the function where we're going a little bit beyond where we should right now uh but where this is not going to work is where the function is not continuous obviously because if you have gaps or jumps there's no slope at that point right it just stops one-sidedly you can do it uh so we we if it was continuous to the end point you could do it but if it jumps from point to point well you you can't find this the tangent line of that there is no tangent line for that also sharp points are non what's called differentiable that's finding the slope uh so something a curved that would look like this see that sharp point you cannot find the tangent to that point why well theoretically I mean I could draw an infinite number of tangent lines through that point right CU it it's not uh the slope doesn't I got to got to back up to explain this but what the slope is is a limit going to one point right the slope is that limit that means it has to exist and be the same from both directions the slope going this way is not the same as the slope going this way therefore it would fail the limit would fail therefore the finding the slope would fail does that make sense so non-continuous points limit fails Shar points limit fails because the slopes are not the same and that's what we're looking for I'll explain this in much more detail later but if you have understanding now well that's great preview sneak peek o people love those sneak good question any other questions you ready see some applications applications good how to maybe use this stuff we're going to talk about average velocity then we're going to talk about instantaneous velocity we're going to see the relationship between this and this come to play again average velocity if I talk about average velocity that means average velocity all average velocity is is how far you've gone let me at least write it better for you how far you've gone over how long it took you to get there how far you've gone over how long it took you to get there well that's exactly what this thing that I'm about to write up there says how far you gone can be well F of T Sub 0 + h minus F of T Sub 0 that's how far you've gone let me explain this to you in English F gives you your position true right this is the position when you started this is the position position after a little while that's the plus h did you see that position when you started position after a little while that's the plus h remember that plus h is a little while this is your position after a little while that's how far you've gone if you have your position when you end minus your position when you started that gives you your overall displacement your overall change if we divide that by the time it took you to change that's the H this is the position when you started this is a position after a little while divided by the little while you were traveling in other words displacement over time that's what that says that right there that gives you average velocity now here's the correlation between what we've just done think about this what was this what was this this part this is slope for sure this is actually ignore the limit okay this is slope between two points do you understand that's slope between two points this is instantaneous slope at one point do you see the difference when you get the h z this right here is average veloc it's just the slope between two points that's how you find the average value right you take the slope between two points that's it that's what that is it's the average velocity just a slope between two points that's how you find an average um so let's do one and then I'll show you how to translate this into instantaneous velocity and you're going to see such a connection here are you ready for it so let's let me walk you through how to find out average velocity between a couple points so what if I said find average velocity of here's a position curve according to Time on the interval let's do 1 three let's do 1 three what I want to do right now is simply find average velocity average velocity is a slope between two points now this this will give it to you so what we need to find again is f of T Sub 0 plus h and f of T Sub 0 but before we do that we we might want to identify what is T Sub 0 and what is h so T Sub 0 should be your starting time T Sub 0 starting time what's your starting time no it's not zero your starting time where' you start you started to one yeah that's where you started H is kind of like elapsed time okay it's how much time has passed between when you want to start and when you want to end on this position curve so can you tell me how much time has passed how much is my H not three it' be three if we went from zero to three or we're not we're going from 1 to three how much time has passed two do the subtraction three - 1 is H is 2 you okay with this so far all right now that we have our T Sub 0 = 1 our H equal 2 watch what we can do here what we want to find out and you're going to see that this is just the slope formula again remember we created this from the slope formula right it's all we did this is only a slope formula average velocity then equals F of give me T Sub 0 + H what is T Sub 0 plus how much is H minus F of what's uh what's F of T Sub 0 f of what again all over H how much is H I can't afford to lose you right now I need you to all be with me on this do you see where this one was coming from how about this two how about this one this two this one and that two H yeah so T Sub 0 plus h t Sub 0 plus h we got it f of T Sub 0 all over H you're going to notice that when we're not allowing our H to go to zero we have a legitimate H because there's a legitimate distance between these points do you see what I'm talking about about this is the difference between average velocity and what we're going to do in a minute instantaneous velocity instantaneous says what's the time between an instant well it's pretty darn close to zero right now we actually have a legit time right we have two seconds that or two whatever this is two units of time can you realize that when you do this this is f of 3us f of 1 all over two you with me on that two let me don't change your paper but just watch 3 - 1 that's still two right do you see that this is this is slope formula that's all this is f of 3 says oh well that's Y 2 minus y1 over X2 - X1 that's what this is Y2 - y1 over X2 - X1 do you guys see the slope formula in that it's all that is slope formula is just the average between two points if it's talking about velocity the slope formula this way but we're doing this way so we can take a limit in just a minute to get instantaneous but the slope formula just gives you the average velocity that's it do you guys see the SL formula kind of neat right it looks funky but that's just Y2 - y1 over X2 - X1 how do you find F of three yeah plug that in why don't you do that for me right now plug in F of three tell me what you get oh you know what shoot I got so confused with my FS what should that letter really be S okay thank you you know you can stop me and tell me when I do things like that it doesn't hurt my feelings but I hear from your erasers that you all did the same thing huh all right now it should really be S because we're talking about a position curve we're talking about the S function so s of 3 S of one what is s of three plug in three what do you get88 okay 8 minus uh what's s of one I don't know you tell me it's like two how much is that say what five that means we're going up we're going down our displacements changing on average from natively so we're we're somehow dropping in in our position um if you I ask you to find average speed how would you find average speed maybe you don't know average speed is the absolute value of of average velocity so where velocity has a vector right it's Vector driven which means like you have a direction and a magnitude um speed is not speed is just the magnitude so for instance if I said the average velocity is5 feet whatever we are feet per second the average speed would just be 5T per second are you with me on that so that's our this is our average velocity what it says is are we always going 5T per second no but on average we are from 1 point to the next that's what this says if I Chang this would this stuff change could you still do it sure you understand it's still it's just slope all is is just slope okay I'm not going do this one for you that's the same thing now what we're going to do let's make the jump about instantaneous Bel instantaneous well we already know what average is we just have it on the board over here we have that that's average velocity the question is if H is time not 10 H is not 10 H is time my if H is time and we want to talk about instantaneous velocity how much time elapses in an instant small that's an interesting question isn't it how much time elapses in an instant because when you think about it is it zero very very close if it was Zero that'd be awesome we'd all live forever because time would not EX exist right because if it was Zero you'd add 0 plus 0 0 every instant would have a value of zero to it right we would never age we would just be stuck in the same time that might be boring for you to be stuck in this class for eternity be awesome for me I love this class ex up for you but yeah an instant can't possibly be zero but it can't be anything greater than what greater so we can put our finger on it we can't say it's 0.0000001 tenth of a second or whatever you want to say you can't say it's 00000000000000 1 seconds cuz that would be finite right and you could say then well between one and and the next you can delineate that but instance can be smaller than that is there time between 0.001 seconds and 0.001 seconds yes there's time between that so we no matter how small you make that instant there's something smaller there's something less less small quicker even quicker so from here to here and then quicker than that quicker than that so we can't let it equal zero an instant isn't zero but can we let it approach zero so the idea behind instantaneous velocity is the exact same idea behind uh the slope of curve at a point because if we have this which is our slope and this gave us a slope at a specific point this gives us average velocity and if I let my H go to zero it will give me instantaneous velocity and that's the same thing so what you know now is that the slope of a curve is instantaneous velocity that should make sense if you have a position curve and you find out how fast it's going up at a certain point wouldn't that give you velocity average would be between two points instantaneous is at a single point that's the same idea as the slope between two points and the slope at a single point so instantaneous velocity does the same thing we did with the slope of a curve it says here's the average how do we make it instant I know that this was the average velocity this was a slope between two points what do I want to have happen to the H if I'm talking about an instant where's it going and what's the only thing that will allow me to let H approach zero so I'm take a limit that is instantaneous velocity we have you understand that see the connection between it it's kind of cool right it's same thing uh slope of a curve at a point is instantaneous velocity the slope is average velocity if you're talking about a position curve you want to see an example yes thought you would I hope so at least I have some ready for you for [Music] your position curve is s of T = 500 - 16 T ^2 uh that approximate some gravity curve probably because of6 t^2 that's about how you approximate that uh dropping from maybe a 500t cliff or something I don't know find the instantaneous velocity after 5 seconds so how fast is this thing falling at exactly 5 seconds I don't want average I don't want from zero to five I don't care about that what if I know this is going to in here's a maybe relationship what if I know this is going to impact something at 5 Seconds what I'm going to want to know if I'm going to protect a windshield or something I don't know protect some sort of glass I want to know how how fast that's going so I can say is that glass going to hold up or not right adage isn't going to give it to me instantaneous would so how fast is it going at the moment of impact when's that how fast is that going then you could derive how much force that is and how much uh you you're going to have to hold up under a certain load or whatever whatever that case may be from physics but here right here this is pretty important for us to be able to find the instant velocity of an object at any given time that I say the given time I say is five now you're going to see a connection between what we just did and what we're going to do now because it is the same exact idea what we want to know is instantaneous velocity and what I've given you is that's the limit as H approaches zero s in this case T sub 0 + H - s of T Sub 0 all over H what is your T Sub 0 what's the time at which you want to find the velocity so you know that t Sub 0 is 5 Seconds okay there is no starting and ending time folks you're starting at five and you're stopping at five stopping a little teeny bit past five but so close you can't tell the difference so there is no two times there's no average there is only one there can be be one so it's just anyway so T Sub 0 is 5 can you do what we did before can you find S of five s of 5 + H do you see where the S of 5 and S of 5 plus h are coming from that's what we want up here we actually just did those examples just a little while ago now another question is this could I have asked it a different way could I have asked it hey find me the instantaneous velocity at any time I hope you're hope you're with me on this if I asked it find the instantaneous velocity at any time would you have a five here no would you have a five there you would just leave it as T and then you come up with a formula and you could plug in any time that you want how people feel okay with that that idea so that was the two connections that we we had to make so let's go ahead let's plug this in uh what is s s of 5 + H can you tell me S of 5 + H that says go to the s s position curve and plug in 5 plus h don't not talk at once 500 500 great okay 500 and Sarah you said minus minus what 16 5 16 5+ 5 + 8 5 plus h is nonseparable has to be there 5 + H and then what well let's look at it are you okay getting from here to here you see where it's coming from this is just the position curve at 5 plus h it's a composition take this put it there how much is s of five s of five says take five plug it into your function what do you get 500 - 16 500 - 16 * 5 S sure so 500 - 16 * 25 I have no idea what that is you help help me out with that you have calculators go quick how much it's 100 100 I'll believe you I kind of had some drop off in participation ladies and gentlemen do you know how to find the 100 is it 100 do you know how to find the 100 do you know how to find the 500 -6 5 + h^ S you see where that's coming from you sure we're taking this we're substituting into our function that's 5 + H that's our T Sub 0 plus h that's giving us this expression if we're to substitute these two things well then we've got H we have 500 - 16 5 + h^ 2 - 10050 better okay we'll continue this next time we'll find out exactly how much instan velocity is that out good afternoon how are you guys doing good all right uh we're going to continue talking about this problem now what we're doing is we're trying to find not the average velocity of something which is we found out last time simply the slope between two points we don't want to find the average displacement over time we want to Now find the instantaneous velocity so how fast is an object going moving at a specific point in time an instant like at that one moment it could change before it could change after but right then not an average but an instant like uh I think I gave this example if you're driving down to to LA you go from here to La let's say it's about 300 miles right if you make it in 5 hours how fast were you going see a lot of you are saying 60 right now right because you're doing 300 miles divided by 5 hours would give you 60 mil per hour true that would be your your computation your head however what you just did was an average velocity an average speed as a matter of fact velocity if you want to consider the the direction but that's an average right the overall distance divided by the overall time gives you how fast you're going average now realistically are you going to be driving exactly 60 MPH from Merced La not if you ever been to La uhuh cuz when you get to La you're going like 20 mes an hour when you're in fredd you're like 80 boom and you're you're going right you're not always going 60 you're going faster slower you hit the brakes a semi truck pulls in front of you you flip them off you go faster you know that's just the way it works so we're not talking about the average velocity here we want to know what was your exact speed the moment you crossed the Bakersfield City Limit that's the question we're asking now now what was your exact speed the moment you left Merced you looked at okay I was going 63 maybe I hit Baker speed I'm doing 90 you know it doesn't have to be 60 all the time it could be an instant speed that's what the idea is what we found out is that in order to find the instantaneous velocity we came with a formula that was actually the slope of a curve at a point that's the same exact thing the slope of a curve at a point is the velocity of a certain point of that curve so for us it was did involve a limit or not you remember the reason why it involves a limit is because the H that we're about to put on the board represents your time and in an instant of time how much time passes well very little and that's what we say h is going to zero because very little times passing a little is passing but it's not quantifiable and that's what H approaches zero actually says so we go okay well we know it's a limit as our time our h the distance between t Sub 0 and T sub one the diff the difference in that is going to zero position after you end minus the position when you start gives you your displacement over H which is your distance or sorry your difference in the times how much time has elapsed we're letting H go to zero because we're now taking an instant of time what we need to be good at is taking this information plugging it into this limit and then using what we know about limits to solve the problem let's see if we can do this together are you ready for it so there's two options that you can you have when Computing these instantaneous velocities option number one is well you could compute it for that specific point right in this case what is your T sub Z could you tell me your T sub Z here five sure 5 Seconds T sub Z because that's your starting time and you know what that's also your ending time we want to know what happens at exactly 5 seconds so T Sub 0 would be five the other option that you have is do it in general for any time and then plug in five at the end do you remember us doing that last time we found out the entire uh veloc inst velocity for any time and then we just plugged in a number and found out it was the same as what we thought so we just plug in those numbers later which one would you prefer cuz I don't care do you want to do it with the five or do it in general then plug the five in with the five do with the five whatever so what we want to find out is s of T Sub 0 plus h we need to know that and we need s of T Sub 0 now in our case how much is T Sub 0 please five so this now is five and this is five five five we want to find out those things now it since we have a specific time it's not t sub Z anymore it's well five 5 plus h and S of five are you guys okay with that so far let's see if we can figure this out try it on your own if you'd like I need you to find s so5 and s of 5 + H what does s of 5 mean for you to do plug it into where where sure yeah this says plug in five right there why don't you plug in five there and see how much that gives you has anybody done that already how about s of 5 plus h remember I say it like 5 plus h cuz it's non-separable we don't want s of five and then plus h that would be the wrong way to go we want s of 5 plus h like one thing it's got to be in parenthesis 5 plus h must show up again in parentheses in your problems tell me what s of 5 plus h is going to be please 500 okay I like the 500 then what uhuh 16 great that's got to be there then what please good very good that's just a straight straight up composition right there you're taking 5 + H you're plugging in for T that's all you've done raise your hand feel okay with this so far good deal now we're ready to make a substitution we can take these quantities plug them into those expressions and get our limit so we're going to have a limit instead of s of 5 + H I'm going to put this expression that s of 5 + H is equal to that's 500 - 16 5 + h^ 2 this is s of 5 + H do you agree you sure what's next minus what where you getting the 100 yeah that's s of five so we have that all over how much now it's going to involve some algebra but I need you to break that up I need you to distribute that can you just do 25 + h^2 Square this one square that one does that work please shake your head please no no you're going to have to distribute so distribute that notice we're still writing the limit still a limit it's still going to be over eight you're going to have quite a long expression here here's what's going to happen I'll do this in two steps firstly the 500 stays the same next up I'm going to put the minus 6 16 and then please watch what happens don't do this all in your head don't do this all one time because you're going to make a sign error on the last two terms of this polinomial if you try to do some of this in your head here's what I mean you're going to have this - 16 this means multiply right this you're going to do and you're going to get 25 + 10 H + H2 did you get that as well you sure however notice that this is in parentheses do you see that so what are you going to distribute 16 or Nega 16 that negative is going to change all those signs these second signs are going to change as well so that's important don't forget Theus 100 either so after that help me out let's do this multiplication this is the limit H goes to zero 500 uh tell me the next next few what is that 400 4us 160h m - 16 h^2 and then lastly we'll have this minus 100 don't forget about that hey take a look at the board this is going to be kind of nice do you see anything special that happens here what happens up here what happens what happens to all the constants they're gone you have 500 - 400- 100 you see that all the constants are gone what you're left with is the limit still got to write the limit H goes to Z of 160h - 16 h^2 over H we're on a Ru tell me the next thing we're going to do Factor what your whole idea here your whole idea you can Factor at 16 H as matter of fact if you want to your whole idea here is to cross out H's right that's it that's all you want to do so if I factor out I'm just going to choose the H and I'll show you why in a second why I'm not going to do 16 orative 16 h show you why uh if I factor out the h i get -160 no h- 16 H over H do you agree what happens with H's they're gone okay I love it now that they're gone are you able to evaluate H going to zero well if you do that look what happens then this limit is -60 - 16 * H how much is that- 0 right so - 160 why I didn't factor out the 16 because it's not really necessary if you did you'd have to multiply it by 10 and then you'd still get- 160 you with me on that so on this in our problem we have negative what's 160 what's that even mean what's - 160 what did we just find you got to know you got to know what we just found okay you're both right I heard some people say instantaneous velocity I heard some people say slope you're both right what you've done is You' found the slope of this curve at a specific time what time was that in other words you found out how fast this particle is was it falling or climbing how fast this particle is falling after exactly 5 seconds so when you took a stopwatch you went five and and you you time it and you said how fast is it going 160 whatever it is meters per second feet per second whatever this is based on that's what you're finding this is the instantaneous velocity in units per second so let's assume it's feet feet per second or meters per second miles per second however however uh what our units are does this make sense to you could you do the same thing in general so for instance if I said now now do it for the time of 7 Seconds well you wouldn't run and redo the whole thing right so in that case if I asked you for several times it might be best not to use the five at all right now might be best to leave it in terms of T if you did would you like to see that it comes out the same you want to see that yeah let's say we leave it in terms of T what this is going to do is give you a formula for the slope a formula for the instantaneous velocity and then you plug the time in later that's kind of nice notice what's changed we don't have an actual number to plug in right s of T we just write down s of T you okay with that yes no s of t plus h well sure we have t plus h over here if we do this if we if you substitute in these expressions for these uh the function notation up here we have 500 - 16 t + h^2 that's this minus I need to put parentheses around this because I'm sub subtracting this entire expression 500 - 16 t^2 got to do that all over H from here on out man the calculus is almost done I mean all you got to do is do some algebra do you see but firstly why we have to have those parentheses subtracting that entire expression this negative is going to change to a plus that's going to really affect your problem if if you didn't do that some things are not going to work out right for you here we'll have 500 minus 16 and then in here we'll get T ^2 + 2th H + h^2 just just spoiling t^2 2th H h^2 - 500 + 16 T ^2 if we distribute that -16 -16 t^2 - 32 th oops - 16 h^ 2 - 500 + 16 T ^2 all over H hey I'm doing this fast if I made a mistake you need to let me know have you guys been able to follow that am I right on that we're all right so far so we dist Ed got all this stuff together what's the next thing you're going to do what do you think probably combine anything you can right combine anything you can so let's look at what happens what can you combine what happens up here on my problem 500s they're even easier to see here right 500 500 what else look what would have happened if you forgot to distribute the negative you'd have negative 32 t^2 wouldn't you the H wouldn't factor out you wouldn't be able to simplify it you would be stuck but here here since we got our signs correct those are gone can you combine those ones but we can yeah we can Factor the H out I'll give you two steps here we got -32 [Music] th sorry minus 16 h^2 all over H yeah of course we can Factor the h so okay we'll do that we'll factor out the H remember I don't want I don't care about factoring the numbers right now you're going be pluging them in anyway or you're plugging a number to this anyway so you don't you don't care about that the hes are going to zero ultimately you get the same exact thing we just care in this case to to simplify out that H show H how many people are with me so far feel okay on this good deal have you seen that after you after you know the limits it's really just about your algebra they say that people take calculus to finally fail Algebra I I don't want that to happen to you I want you to know your you know your algebra the calculus is actually quite easy it's not going to be hard the fundamentals you'll all have those down I guarantee you'll have them down because I'm teaching it to you but it's the algebra be very cautious on your algebra your signs just simple stuff hes are gone can you let H go to zero now yes yeah do you also let T go to zero no we're just talking about H so this is what wait a second though why why does this have a t in it because this is now a general formula for the slope it's now a general formula for the instantaneous velocity now if I say hey find me the velocity at 8 seconds could you do it how about 5 Seconds how about 0 seconds CU you find it at any point that I ask you and this is a little bit more powerful than the thing we just did so now at 5 Seconds jeez I hope I hope it works out right it doesn't look like an idiot at 5 Seconds the velocity would be -32 * 5 is that what we had before yeah stressful stressful job I have here 160 again feet per second same exact thing same sign even by the way how would you get speed from this this is a velocity how do you get speed so what's the speed here 160 feet per second so speed doesn't have a direction velocity does so if you get a a question says what's the or what's the instantaneous speed well you just take your absolute value your instantaneous velocity and you'll get the speed it's just the magnitude of U of that Vector not not the direction so how can velocity be measured negative and posi up positive up and down down negative climbing falling okay Rockets have a positive velocity when they're climbing and a negative velocity when they're falling this was a band thrown off the cliff 500t Cliff you had negative velocity that's what happened true story okay uh last thing another section here there's another connection I need to make for you uh you already you already know that this calculus stuff is pretty intriguing because we've just found out the slope of a curve at a point is the same thing as instantaneous velocity right so we find out the same way which is kind of cool the other thing we're going to find out is something about rates of change rate of change you know we normally say that what is our rate of change for instance if I give you a straight line like this what is the rate of change what do we call that slope no not it is a straight line already right so the straight line can't have a tangent to it well unless you it can't have a tangent to it consider that to be a tangent the straight line is itself has a sorry in and of itself has a rate of change and we call that rate of change slope we say we're going up two and over one right or going up one or and over five going down and all that stuff that's a rate of change so slope is a rate of change just a basic example here what's the rate of change why would you say 3 over one he's right why would you say 3 over one that's SL slope is a rate of change so the rate of change is 3 over 1 how about for this one what's the rate of change there sure negative one of one if you want to say one or just negative one would be the rate of change all right here's what this says to us here's the jump we can make well if slope is a rate of change and we know that well if if you look at this velocity to a rate right the rate of change change here instantaneously was well the slope of a curve at a point and that's what we're saying here if we want to find an instant rate of change for a curve that's just the slope of the curve a rate of change is a slope right if we want to find the slope of a curve that's instantaneous rate of change and that's what we're saying so since of rate of change is a slope an instantaneous rate of change is the slope of a curve at a point for of course we need to make it a little bit more mathy than that here's the mathy part of it this going go very quick because you can see it's exactly the same thing that we've just been doing okay here's a rate of change this would be considered your average rate of change average rate of change is exactly like this it will be that why that is that also secant in other words it is the what between two points dist not the distance distance form have squ it's the average that's what it says average sure but what does this formula give you oh come on we spent so much time doing that what's that formula quo difference quo gives you what the not not the tangent but the slope of the tangent yes so what is this this is just slope right that's just slope between two points that's what we're saying the rate of change is a slope the rate of change is a slope that's an average rate of change how I find the instantaneous rate of change is do what to this thing a put a limit on front as H approaches what yeah so that's how we're going from an average rate of change to an instantaneous are you starting to see that every one of these things is almost identical average is just a slope okay instantaneous is the limit of that slope saying find it at a point that's all that's all we're doing so if this is the average rate of change the instantaneous rate of change is identical to an instantaneous velocity it's identical to the slope of a curve at a point it is a limit as H approaches zero of the slope it says what's the slope as you approach one point that's it now is it acceptable to solve saying uh say we want instain velocity to first work out our slope of our secant and then just once we have that all worked out then just add the limit to it and solve that way definitely not because your slope of secant is going to be an actual IAL value right like five when you take the limit of five it's always five so what you're saying is what what you'd be implying there is this question maybe I'm saying it wrong here's the question you're you're implying is the slope between those two points which is your average slope your average rate of change understand is this slope the same as this slope possibly what about this slope no what about this slope that slope that slope that's right no no no no no no so no you can't just do the average rate of change and say oh this is also an instantaneous rate of change I'm take a limit you can't do that what you can do is say I'm going to consider my slope function and then make the H go to zero and that's that's a different way of saying okay that's what like on the test we could figure out solve for get rid of the H on the bottom and then add in our limit once we've had it all simplified down and then solve the limit yeah that's exactly what you're doing here okay that's that's it okay well I'm not going to do this problem for you but I would like to set up just talk about it a little bit let's say that I have uh oh a problem to find the average and the instantaneous rates of change of a of a curve the average I'd like that over 2 comma 5 and the instantaneous at a point of two can you explain to me maybe a little critical thinking here why am I giving you a range of numbers for the average but I'm only giving you I'm actually give end points for the average but I'm only giving you one number for the instantaneous why is that one oh well it's not technically at one point but it's over such a small distance that we consider it to be one point right so what we want to know here is average is over yeah it's over distance of time right it's over a distance and a Time saying compare the distance to this overall elapse time how much time elapses in an instant pretty close to zero that's why I give you only one point here so could you do both of these things with this information we're just going to talk about it I'm not going to do it for you because I've already given like five examples of the same thing here's how you do the average in our case our average our starting spot would be what's our x sub Z for this case that's where you start how much is your h why why is it three good so in our case right here x Sub 0 would be 2 H would be three because that's the distance that's the elapsed time that it took that would be two that would be three are you okay on the average average rate of change for that one you plug in the two because that's where you started you plug in the three because that's how long it took you you'd calculate that you plug it into your function we've done all this stuff before you take your five you take your two and divide by three you plug in your five to your function plug in your two to your function then you figure that out and divide by three can you follow that you sure all right do I need to do it for you are you okay okay that was not an answer silence yes no no you all right yeah see it good I want to do it anyway forget you guys plug in five plug in the two what do you get when you plug in five 71 what you me plug in two 8 over 3 71 - 8 that would be your average rate of change for that that's how you figure it out plug in the five plug in there to to your function I plugged in right here then divide by your H that's average I'm definitely not going to show you the instantaneous right now because we've just done that for instantaneous again you have two options your X Sub 0 would be -2 so you could find -2 + h f of -2 then do your limit right or you could just do this with your function and then plug the number in later we just did that example right here we did that twice I showed you how to plug in the number and I showed you how to not plug in the number and do it later that's the same exact problem right there how many people feel okay with with this one good deal now we're
