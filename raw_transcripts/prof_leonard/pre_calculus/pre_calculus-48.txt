Transcript for: Composition of Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 48)
hey everybody welcome to another video in this video we're going to start learning about composite functions or composition of functions and here's the idea what we're going to learn about a little bit later is exponentials and logarithms and how they are inverses and if you compose them well they're going to cancel each other out and we're going to learn about that but it takes composite functions and inverses to finally get there so that's why we're learning this I'm going to tell you exactly what it is how you do it uh and then we'll talk about the domain of composite function in the next video so here's what a composition of functions actually does it takes one function opens up the variable and shoves an entire other function inside it where that variable is so really it's just replacing a variable of one function with an entire other function that's what that statement means so when one entire function is substituted into the variable of another the notation looks a little weird if you've never seen it before if we have two functions f and g of X then a composition of functions says F of G of X and that's how you pronounce it and this says F of G ofx but it really shows you what we are doing so this little open o there it stands for f of G of X it's not multiplication that's not what composition of functions does this is talking about what this is saying now what is this saying it says F of G ofx but here's what it's saying this says in the function f the output G ofx X is the input for f ofx it sounds a little weird but basically if you look at the notation it's saying this x is replaced with this entire function f ofx becomes F of G of X the entire function G replaces the variable X so we're going to show that I'm going to refer back to this when we get to plugging in some numbers over here or evaluating our composite functions but that's basically what we're doing so I'll give you the Leonard technique on how you do composition functions you all know that Taylor Swift is really good at math at least songs reference that so we're going to talk about the blank space as far as composite functions goes the best way to think about them so here here we go let's suppose we have two functions f and g 2x^2 - 5 and 1 - 3x^2 respectively here's what a composite function asks you to do it says I want you to take a look at the first function this first function is what you were composing upon so it says I'm going to look at F ofx I'm going to read F ofx 2x^2 minus 5 now we know about functions we know that the variable of the function the independent variable is where you the only place where you can actually plug something into so in 2x^2 - 5 x that variable is the only place you can plug anything in if you want to plug in five you'd put in five you'll plug in seven you put in seven plug in anything you want you plug anything you want into that X including another function and so what a composite function asks you is take F and open it up allow yourself to plug something into it create for yourself a blank space wherever you have variables so we would keep our two but the x that variable is openable if you if you will create a blank spots that really what a variable stands for anyway right something that you can evaluate into something you can plug into well we're allowing ourselves that with this blank space in your head right now this should signify the same thing that that say this says 2 something you can plug in 4^ 2 - 5 this says 2 something you can plug in 4^ 2 - 5 they represent the same thing so in a composition of functions we look at the first function f we're going to open that with a blank space and then whatever I plug into whatever I want to plug in for f i put it right here well that's what this is saying so again if I want to plug in something like three or five or seven or Nega five or whatever I would put it here just like I put it in for the X this is the place where you put in for for x and if you remember back to how I I've taught you to evaluate I always do this don't I I always take what I'm evaluating or the function I'm evaluating I write a parenthesis and I put a number in there in this case we're writing parenthesis and putting another function so F opens up and this second function is what they're telling you to put inside of that so I'm looking at my comp composition function I'm saying my first function is f I'm writing my f with the blank space I'm allowing myself to plug in for a variable and then the second function listed is what you put inside of your parentheses the entire thing do not separate it it's not separable it's one - 3x^2 that's what G ofx is and so that is what I'm evaluating inside the function f this is taken one function G ofx and substitute it into the variable of another function f ofx that's all there is to composition of functions now we do have to simplify it but I want to pause for a second to make sure that you're seeing it you should be seeing that F the first function got open with the blank space g of X the second function listed got inputed into that got evaluated into it it got comp composed into the F ofx now we do need to simplify this how you simplify these functions is really important so we want to make sure that we simplify any exponents first that happen so we're not going to be Distributing two we're going to be Distributing 1 - 3x^ 2 * 1 - 3x 2 due to the nature that it is being squared so we're going to take a moment and do that we can think of this as 1 - 3x^2 * 1 - 3x2 we should be pretty good at at um at Distributing at this point so we would get 1 - 6 x^2 plus 9 x 4th if we were to distribute that that's 1 - 3 - 3 that's - 6 x^2 and then + 9 x^2 remember that we still have a 2 and we still have a minus 5 so when we distribute we get 2 - 12x^2 + 18 x 4 - 5 and if we combine some like terms we're going to get and we can put in order also we could have done that up here we just didn't do it I gave you a problem that I just thought of and so we if we put this in order then we can put 18 x to 4th - 12 x^2 - 3 if we combine like terms appropriately I'm going to erase this this is just my simplification this is all we've done is simplify this and make this a little bit more usable a little bit more friend in standard form instead of some quasi factored uh form of a polom so we're going to have 18 x 4 - 12x^2 minus 3 this is what the composition F of G ofx created for us it's a new function now in the next video we're going to explore what the domain is going to be and I'm going to ruin it right now the domain of a composition of functions is a combination of the inside functions domain combined with the domain of what you get at the end so we look at two places what are you plugging in find the domain of what you're plugging in find the domain of what you get at the very end and combine those so this domain would be domain here uh well there's no square roots uh there's no denominators that have variables in them um there's no logarithm so our domain is all real numbers there's no square roots here there's no denominators that have variables in them there's no logarithms our domain is also all real numbers so domain of all real numbers combined with the domain of all real numbers says our composition also has a domain of all real numbers we'll explore that a lot more in the next video because we'll have some more difficult compositions so this is what F of G ofx stands for it's just taking one function inside the other function let's move on to the next one let's take a look at G of f ofx now G of f ofx is not in general going to be the same composition as F of G ofx they're not if you want to think about it as commutative they're not commutative you cannot reverse these and get the same thing except for one condition I know that I'm I always teach you before we get there I'm teaching you about inverses right now if your composition is the same F of G or G of f what it means is that those two functions are inverses we'll talk about that when we get to inverses it's it's a big deal um it's important for us to understand that so it's only time your composition can be reversed and get the same thing out and that thing I guarantee will just be X and that's how you test whether you have inverses or not we'll see that in the next video too but in the meantime we're going to explore what G of f ofx means so a composition says take a look at the first function that they reference in this case this is G of X we're going to write G of x to give ourselves a place for us to plug in so I'm going to look at G of I'm going to replace the variable or every instance of the variable with parentheses I need to be able to plug something into that function and the variable is the place where you do it so I'm going to take my one leave it my three leave it and X is the only place if variable is the only place you can plug something in for so I'm going to create a blank space which allows me to plug in for that variable if I had wanted to find G of two I'd plug in two there that's the same thing or G of7 I plug in7 there in this case accomplishes says I want G of F I want to evaluate F into that function so what I want to do is take my function f and this says open up G I've done it take your function f i want to take my function f and evaluate it inside the function G so I have my blank space it says write the appropriate name right F ofx in this case what this has done is this this has taken the function f ofx right here and put it inside the function G right here that's all a composition does if this is making sense to you you're golden you know exactly what a composition of functions really does it takes your first function opens it up basically replaces your variable with a blank space and then takes your second function and pl plugs it in there just kind of forces it in there the entire function all of this in that variable that's exactly what this technique does now we have to simplify so I'm going to be a little bit quicker about this we're going to distribute 2x^2 - 5 quantity 2 if we do that we would get 4 x 4 - 20 x^2 + 25 so I'm thinking of this as 2x^2 - 2x^2 that's 4X 4 - 10 x^2 minus another 10 X2 is where we get that from and then plus 25 but keep in mind we also need to distribute the three which means some sign changes so -12x 4 + 60 x^2 - 75 if we combine some like terms and we're going to write this in order here we're going to get a -12 x 4 + 60 x^2 - 74 now we could go and do things like factoring if we need to but this this is where we can stop this is the a simplified version of the composition of functions G of f ofx notice this is not the same as that they're completely different because these two functions are not inverses so I'm trying to teach you that as we go that way we we get there and say hey if you canst two inverses they're going to give you X everything's going to cancel out if you compose two inverses backwards it's going to give you the same thing it's going to be X I'm going start teaching you that as we go so let's go ahead and I'm going to rewrite this that way we have this a little more concisely after we simplified it so G of F ofx that composition is exactly what we have here okay so we're going to move on just a little bit we're going to get some sort of sometimes awkward looking compositions so let's take a look at F of f of x what that F of f it's almost sounds like you're stuttering a little bit F of f ofx what in the world is that mean that means that we're going to take the first function f and inside the variable for f we're going to place the whole function f again so if you follow the technique I teach you the whole Blank Space ideology if you will says take your first function f just ignore this for a second just look at your first function what I'm telling you is look here and I want you to write that function with a blank space every place you have a variable have a blank space of a parentheses now so the first function f 2^2 - 5 we're going to have two Blank Space squar - 5 that is what the function f says so our composition says look here rewrite it with blank spaces done now look at the second function the second function is f who cares all this is telling you is what you want to put in the function that you just opened open this one put this one inside of it so now we're going to look at the second function what's the second function the second function is f again so we're going to look there f is 2x^2 - 5 it says I want you to take this function f and put it inside of the parentheses that you just created might look a little funny this is not an inverse this is a composition of a function on to itself it in general is not going to give you an inverse there are some special cases where it can but in general it can't and so we're going to distribute this but before we do it we're going to check our work did we take our first function open it to parentheses squ minus 5 yes did we take our second function whatever it is and plug it in the whole entire function into the blank space which represents the variable yes we did now we simplify that so when we do we'll have our two we already did this distribution 2x^2 - 5^ 2 uh and that gave us give us 4x^2 - 20 x^2 + 25 we're almost done we're going to distribute the two and then we're going to combine some like terms this is already in order for us so 8 x 4 - 40 x^2 + 50 and then subtracting five from that gives us our 45 and so if we write that this is what the composition F of f of x is what I'd like you to do is actually see if you can pause the video and try G of G of x if you have well you should should if you have't um if you have what we should get out of this is the idea that this composition is asking you look at G ofx that's why it's listed first is look here and I want you to replace the variables in whatever function is first with a parenthesis so I'm looking at my G of X I'm not even looking here yet I'm not looking at the second G I don't even really care about that I'm looking at the first function I'm focused on this I'm opening up the variable with parenthesis now now I take the blinders off I know that this is represented by this with a blank space this place where I can plug stuff into now I look at my second function that's listed to my composition and go okay I've opened up my first one now I look here and I just replace whatever is in the parentheses I replace that Blank Spot or plug that in Blank Spot with my second function my second function is also G of X so I look here and go okay I'm just taking this entire thing I'm putting it here this is what G of G of X should look for and here's what it does practically we're going to see this as we go through here what a composition does it basically runs an input through two functions in a very specific way it runs an input through the rightmost function first and then whatever you get out of this the output of this function becomes the input for your first function I'm going to show you right here what is your input here because this is what F of G ofx stands for it's this what's your input here well your input is X but that's only for the function G so this says take your input plug it into g whatever you get out of that oh wait that becomes the input for f so the output here G ofx stands for an output the output of G ofx acts as the input for the function f and that's what this is doing for us this is saying this this function G I'm going to plug into X right it's going to have to run through this function one time the output of that XS is the input for this next time I run through G it's a very interesting concept if we simplify this we're going to distribute one - 3x * 1 - 3x of course you should have caught me on this one hopefully I can't take an excuse on that one just completely missed that power too but at least I caught it so we're going to get 1 - 6x^ 2 + 9x 4 so I'm thinking 1 - 3x 2 * 1 - 3 2 that's 1 - 6 x^2 and then + 9 x 4 we're going to distribute the -3 again we get min -3 + 18 x^2 and - 27 x 4th power if we combine some like terms and write this in order we're going to have 27 x 4 first + 18 x^2 and then minus 2 and we combine some like terms so we're going to write that now and this is really every permutation of our compositions we can do we've done F of G which takes G and plugs into F we've taken G of f which takes F and plugs into g f of f which takes F onto itself G of G which takes G onto itself and we simplified everything done a lot of work um just so you know the domain of every one of these compositions is all real numbers because we didn't develop any fractions or square roots or logarithms and the domain of both of my initial functions is all real numbers so the domain for all of these is all real numbers we're we're going to see some different things in the next video now we're going to work on evaluating some composition of functions there's two ways to do this so let's take a look at F of G of 1 and see what this is really asking us to do I'm going to give you both of these ways the um the not really having to think about it part the not really having to think about it way to do this is identify which of these compositions you have over here and just plug in the value so if we take F of G of one this says well wait a minute we've worked really hard to figure out F of G of X right and X is our input so if I change this this x to1 this is saying F of G of 1 and F of G of X I can just evaluate F of G of X for one so basically just plug in one to the F of G of x that you have simplified and that will work so if I take F of G of 1 put in our one here for f of G of X that'd be 18 - 12 - 3 well 18 - 12 that's 6 - 3 is three so I should be getting three now the other way to do this uh little little bit more thought but possibly easier because some of these exponents are fairly large possibly easier here's what we would do we would take the one and this has to run through these two functions in this order one acts as and we already talked about right here one acts as the input for the second function listed why the second one F of G ofx says we want F of G ofx that second function is your initial thing you plug in that is your initial input you can see it right here the second function inside is what you'd have to plug into first second function is inside which you got to plug in first and then it runs to the first function so for f of G of one you run one as an evaluation uh you evaluate one into G first so if we put this into G then this would be 1 - 3 * 1 2 well 1 2 is 1 3 * 1 is 1 this would be -2 so if I did g of 1 we get -2 that output that output of G becomes the input for f the first function you you deal with so now we say okay I plugged in one for G it was -2 -2 gets now run through as as evaluated in F so -22 is 4 uh 4 * 2 is 8 8 - 5 is 3 again so we did g of 1 1 we got -2 and then F of -2 we take our input into our second function that output becomes the input for our first function that's the second way to go about doing it either way works we got three um in either case it really doesn't matter but you can see that this way requires a little more thought this was already thought out that's why you're able to just plug it in this requires a little more thought but it can be a little bit easier when some of these exponents are fairly large let's take a look at the next few of them we're going to do it fairly quick so if we evaluate G of f of x for -2 that's what this is asking to do go here G of f plug in two in that simplified version you can actually do it here too you plug it in here so if I evaluate for two I'm going to get 2 4th power 16 16 * -12 is - 19 196 2^ 2 4 4 * 60 is 240 - 74 all of that's going to give you -26 now is it easier to plug this two into F figure out the output use that output as an input for G maybe let's try that so what this says is take your two it acts as an input for f ofx based on what we know about what's going on here so two gets put into your second function whatever it is and case it's F so think that this would be G of f of 2 this is what is going on right now we have to find F of two first and then G of that output F of two is an output it's the output of the function f when you have an input of 2 so take two plug it in here uh that's 4 * 8 and 4 * 2 is 8 - 5 is 3 so F of 2 is 3 now we want to find G of three so F of 2 gave us three and now we're finding G of whatever that output is if we plug in three evaluate uh 3 2 is 9 3 * 9 is 27 1 - 27 is - 26 it's the same thing that we would get and it has to be the same if you've done this correctly I hope that's making sense I hope you're seeing the interplay between these composition of functions that F of whatever this is that's your you're inputting this into the the second function first the output of which acts as your input for your first function now let's do the last couple little bit strange to plug something into itself but that's exactly what this asked us to do so F of f of1 says take negative 1 evaluate in whatever this function is in this case here's F of f so I can take negative one and put it here and here now because this is an even function a you should verify that even Powers if I pluged into negative it's not going to affect anything this would give us a - 40 + 45 so that looks like that's going to be 13 or we can do it this way take1 evaluate into your second function use this as the input for this function so F of1 Well that's going to give me -3 I evaluated F of1 that's 3 and now my -3 the output of my first valuation becomes the input for my second evaluation so F of negative3 my output 9 * 2 that's 18 - 5 that's 13 and the last one g of G of zero if we go to G of G we've already simplified this if I plug in zero I get -2 that's nice if I want to do it differently G of G of Z says take G and evaluate it with the output of G when you plug in zero that's technically the exactly way that this is this is going on so it says evaluate G of Z and then use that output as an input for G again so G of 0 is one you did this it was that now that output that you just got X is the input for G again so we're evaluating 1 it looks like -2 because we have 1 2 1 - 3 * 1 is -2 that's exactly what we got it matches up we know that this is correct I hope that I've explained composition of functions for you um hopefully you understand a blank space idea where you take your first function open up every variable with a parenthesis that's a blank space something you plug into take your second function plug it in and then simplify and simplifying is actually the hardest part here evaluating you can do it a couple ways and we've gone through that so in the next video we'll talk more about domain so what happens when you don't have domains that are all real numbers all of the time how do you represent that so I'll see you for another video
