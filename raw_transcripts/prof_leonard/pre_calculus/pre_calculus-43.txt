Transcript for: Finding Asymptotes and Holes of Rational Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 43)
hey there welcome to another video so this video is all about putting together the ideas that last like four or five videos we are going to just basically be practicing i'm gonna give you an outline of structure on how to find all the asymptotes and holes in a function we're going to basically do six examples as fast as i can i can while still explaining the concepts but i'm not really teaching you anything new that we haven't done just the order in which you go to make this most efficient can you go out of order yes but i found this order really keeps things structured well and limits the amount of work that you have next time next video longest video in this series is going to be practicing graphing this so right now this would be like the first few steps in how to graph rational functions so here's what we're going to get into what i expect you'll learn from this is how to appropriately find a horizontal asymptote an oblique asymptote vertical asymptote and holes if they exist so we're going to put all that together so uh the first thing we want to do find your end behavior first your end behavior includes either a horizontal asymptote or an oblique asymptote or just straight up end behavior you're not going to have all of them just one of them we're going to use leading terms to do that after you've done that then factor the reason why we do the end behavior first is typically your rational functions come as polynomials in that standard form first and that's easiest just to find your leading terms rather than having to factor then redistribute or go backwards we really don't want to have to do that so i'm making this in order for you after that we factored great define your domain say what x values can't happen and then say how they can't happen that would be determine whether your domain issues create a vertical asymptote or a hole whether or not you can cross out that factor or not and then determine where that hole is if you have to if there is a hole you need to find kind of the point that's missing and we're going to use that graphically in the next video and if you have a vertical asymptote whether that is even or odd based on the multiplicity so we're going to get right into it again i'm going to be going very quickly i'm teaching you this this lesson on this assumption that you've watched the last few videos and you know how to find a horizontal oblique or asymptote or end behavior and vertical asymptote if one exists so let's go here the first thing we're going to do with any function if it's not already factored is we're going to find the end behavior so when we look at end behavior and behavior deals with the leading terms of your polynomials both the numerator and denominator because they are power functions your variables at least on one of the numerator denominator will always cancel out fully in this case they both do and if we think back to a horizontal asymptote the first thing you might do is go oh yeah hey those have the same degree i am going to have a horizontal asymptote at the leading coefficients in other words three over one we can see that by end behavior i always show end behavior every single time because by simplifying you are going to find either a horizontal asymptote or an oblique asymptote or end behavior every time you just have to interpret it so in this case you go yeah you're just giving it 3 what does that mean that means you are going to have a function that gets toward y equals 3 as you approach positive and negative infinity that's a horizontal asymptote at three so that's pretty much done so all right that that's great if you want to just do the uh kind of the i don't know cliff notes version of it you look at your degrees if they're the same take your coefficients and that's your horizontal asymptote if your degrees are the same you're going to get a horizontal asymptote at the leading coefficients if not you either have a numerator that has a higher degree or denominator numerator higher you get oblique asymptote or end behavior that's not one of these two things if the degree of the denominator you get a horizontal asymptote at zero so we'll talk about that in just a minute all right the next thing we would do is factor now when we look at the numerator and the denominator this is already factored completely so 3x plus 5 is linear and x minus 6 is linear i'm going to do this just to make sure that we see that that factor that is one factor and then we're gonna set our factors on the denominator equal to zero to see what our domain restrictions are so we go all right x minus six is our only factor if i add 6 we'd say well x with x equals 6 x equals 6 is a problem so x equals 6 is something that i need to restrict you see if i allow x to equal 6 i get zero on the denominator that's a big issue that's undefined so we say on our domain our domain is any number except for six we can't allow that now we determine how we can't allow it this is either going to create a hole at x equals 6 or a vertical asymptote at x equals 6. so and remember you need to know about vertical asymptotes from a previous video so we we do this it's all stuff we've done before we go all right our factor equals zero by the zero product property we know that we're defining our domain denominators cannot equal zero or we have undefined values this is an undefined value so we cannot allow x equal to equal six now what that creates for us depends on whether the factor that gives us this undefined value can be cancelled therefore creating a whole or can't can't cancel therefore creating a vertical asymptote so we look at x minus six can you cancel that factor with something on the numerator uh no then at x equals 6 we have an undefined value but at x equals 6 that undefined value is created for us a vertical asymptote so this is what we can't have and what we do next is how we can't have it it's kind of a weird statement it's either gonna be a missing point we don't have anything there or a vertical asymptote we don't have anything there just two different things so at x equals six we have a vertical asymptote kind of like a force field vertical force field and we're going to define whether or not that is an even or an odd vertical asymptote and that depends on what our our multiplicity is for that factor we're going to get odd or even depending on what that power is which is why we put in parentheses to create a factor well that power is 1 so that would be an odd power or odd multiplicity vertical asymptote and that tells us that this vertical asymptote is going to look like this or like this depends some signs that we deal with at the next video so we've done and we okay end behavior we have a horizontal asymptote of 3. we've looked at our powers determined that we were going to have a horizontal asymptote at leading coefficients we found that by taking our leading terms and simplifying or just recognizing kind of that shortcut y equals 3 is our horizontal asymptote we defined our domain and then said what that's going to give us this is the first few steps on how we graph rational rational functions let's go ahead and let's deal with our next example so next example we're going to do the same thing just very quickly the first thing we're going to do is find end behavior how we do that and i do this every single time i take my first two terms my leading coefficients of the numerator denominator respectively and we make a ratio and because those are always power functions your variables on either the numerator or denominator or both are going to disappear in this case we know that we can simplify and get 1 over x now think critically about it what is going to happen at the ends of your functions think back to the video horizontal asymptote well as x gets positive or x gets negative 1 divided by really big positive numbers or really big negative numbers a limit idea one divided by really big values either positive or negative is getting close to zero this is going to have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero we learned that in horizontal asymptotes that if your degree of your denominator is larger than your numerator you will have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero so as x gets bigger this function approaches zero i'm not going to write out that limit i did that on that video as x approaches positive infinity g of x approaches zero and as x approaches negative infinity well g of x still approaches zero just from positive and negative places that's what we're doing so we will have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero the degree of the denominator is larger than the numerator it outpaces it so we have constant over some number getting really really big that's getting close to zero after that we have to factor everything now the numerator is factored but that x to the fourth minus one we've seen it a couple times that's like a difference of squares wrapped up in another difference of squares so i'm going to take a moment and think of this as x squared squared so x squared squared minus 1 squared would give us x squared minus 1 and x squared plus 1. but that's also a difference of squares this one's not that's an irreducible quadratic you cannot factor anything more that is done but this is a reducible quadratic you can factor that as x minus 1 and x plus 1. so our function becomes x cubed already factored over x minus 1 x plus 1 and x squared plus 1. now if you remember doing this this exact factoring was in well it was when we talked about complex solutions to these these polynomials we are not worried about complex solutions when we are graphing polynomials or rational functions they're not going to create anything for us they just kind of hang on in this class calculus one they typically will create some sort of a turning point or a local maximum local minimum that doesn't interact with your x-axis so that's typically what they do so in our case here we go okay we've already found our end behavior notice it's a lot easier to find end behavior here than it would be from a factored polynomial or factored rational function this you'd have to redistribute or at least fake distribute if you remember that x times x times x squared is x to the fourth you'd have to do that again so that's kind of annoying that's why we do end behavior first now that we have everything factored we're going to define our domain so our domain says hey look at your denominator take all the factors that are there and set them equal to zero all right so we know that if our denominator equals zero that's a problem so x minus one equals zero would create a a problem for us an undefined value of x uh based on the zero product property of setting your denominator equal to zero same thing with x plus one now x squared plus one equals zero that would be another factor set equal to zero by the zero product property but this is not possible to solve over the real number system so this basically gives us nothing that we have to worry about as far as our domain here's the point you can't plug in a real number square it add one and get zero that's impossible so that's not giving us any sort of domain restrictions in the real number system which is how we're graphing so this basically does nothing for us these two however if we add one and subtract one respectively this is giving us some values that are causing zeros on our denominator if i plug in one that's zero times i don't care and plug in negative one that's zero times i don't care it's going to give you zero on the bottom of your fraction it's a problem so our domain says you need to restrict those those are two values that you can't have now how can't you have them do they create a hole at those values of x or do they create a vertical asymptote we look back back at our factor for that so we look back at here's 1 came from x minus 1 the factor that said hey if i can cancel out x minus 1 that's a whole or a removable in other words say that if you can't that's a vertical asymptote there's nothing on our numerator to cancel that factor so this is defining a vertical asymptote at x equals 1. that can be kind of confusing the notation you're saying wait a minute i thought x can't equal 1. it can't so at x equals 1 we have something that you cannot allow and that's what we're saying here at x equals 1 you have a vertical asymptote that's a disallowed value of x that's that's why we define it that way it's kind of like saying hey at x equals one that vertical asymptote says yeah you can't have one you can't let the function uh have an x value of one it's just showing how we're disallowing it so at x equals one we have a vertical asymptote and we look back at the exponent of the factor that's giving us that vertical asymptote it's one that means that it's odd one is an odd number and you're either going to do this or this odd means opposite infinities the same exact thing happens at x equals negative one at x equals negative one we cannot allow that x value so we look back at the factor that's giving us that i can't cancel it that means that at x equals negative one we have another vertical asymptote also has an exponent of one meaning that's odd so we're going to have a kind of an interesting graph here uh this doesn't do anything for us as far as a vertical asymptote or a hole because this can't equal zero so it's not creating a domain problem for us domain problems are what gives us those graph issues of vertical asymptote or whole so in our case we're going to have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero that's the x-axis and we'll have two vertical asymptotes okay you can cross a horizontal but you can't ever touch a vertical that's why they're undefined and we're sort of saying how they're undefined so we'll have this at end behavior and we'll have vertical asymptotes in the middle at 1 and negative 1. so this graph and they're odd so this graph does something like this or this and something like this or this at both of those asymptotes because they are odd that's what i need you to focus on and get out of this lesson is what we're doing and the structure of how we're doing it we have four more examples again i'm going to go quite quickly through them i'm going to start showing you uh what would happen if we have a numerator larger than a denominator um whether we have an oblique or just end behavior so we'll get to that just a second all right let's get right to it so we got a couple more examples let's take a look at g of x we are always going to find end behavior first on our rational functions if they come in standard form which is everything that's distributed if not we have a chance to go out of order but we're going to get to that when we start graphing rational functions that's kind of the exception to the rule so we're typically going to start by having a distributed or standard form rational function and we're going to find end behavior we look at our leading coefficients that's the first two terms and if you want to kind of get in your head what's going to happen consider the degrees we have a degree 4 over a degree 2. the numerator is larger than the denominator in your head right now you should be thinking that means that we cannot possibly have a horizontal asymptote those only happen when they're equal or the denominator is bigger we also can't have an oblique because the numerator is larger for an oblique asymptote but only larger by power one this is more than power one so this is going to have end behavior that's not oblique and not horizontal asymptote so what we're going to do is we're just going to take the leading coefficients simplify them and it's going to show us how this function is going to behave in this end behavior all right so when we take our leading terms we have this x to the 4th over x squared power functions are always reducible by the variables so we're going to say all right this is really just giving us x squared that is how this function is going to look so draw a picture of it when you have just end behavior draw a picture of it so x squared is a parabola that's upward opening because that is positive x squared and not negative x squared so this picture is going to look something like that now some cool stuff you have in the middle like a vertical asymptote or things like x-intercepts so y-intercept stuff like that yep this could have could have that uh actually no i can't have a y-intercept so we're going to have a vertical asymptote at zero we'll see that in just a second but when we when we do this we have at least a picture of outsides that's what's going to happen it's going to follow x squared as we get to positive and negative infinity on the x axis that's going to happen you can see that if you did like the limit idea take x let it go really big it's then square you're going to get this take x let it get really negative and square it you're going to get positive infinity again it's going to look like that next thing we do is factor everything so on our numerator sort of like the last example we think of this as x squared squared minus 4 squared well when we factor that that's going to give us x squared minus 4 and x squared plus 4 it is a difference of squares while that's not factorable that's an irreducible quadratic again x squared plus constant you can never factor that x squared minus constant you can always factor that so we can factor that as x minus 2 and x plus 2. so we've taken this we've factored it we've factored it completely a polynomial is always factorable as linear and or irreducible quadratic factors so we have that that's irreducible quadratic that's linear that's linear so we're good on the denominator well we see that we have a gcf hopefully we have gcf we have a gcf of x so we can just simply factor out x don't forget that that's possible always look for gcf first if we factor out x then we get x minus 2. and i want to pause right here and tell you that the order of these steps is really important especially these three steps you can sort of do this one out of order sometimes it's fine you can simplify first you get the same end behavior but this right here is very important factor then define domain then say what the the domain causes graphically so we factor now before you cancel stuff out you are going to define your domain it's very important to not just oh it's gone because you're going to miss a hole which is ironic really when you think about it we're going to factor this and we're going to define the domain by looking at your denominator again and by the zero product property setting every factor equal to zero before you cancel so x would equal zero and x minus two would equal zero you see both of those are factors that if we allow them to equal zero the entire denominator equals zero you go yeah set that equal to zero zero product property would say okay this would cause that and this would cause that and we're going to solve them so x equals zero is great x equals two if we add two and here's what this means those are two issues that cause something undefined in our function so as far as our domain is concerned you might have wondered why do we spend so much time on domain for this so that you understand that we've been talking about domain for two classes now so domain says you cannot allow x equals zero and you cannot allow x equal two if that happens you have problems now we're going to say what problems they cause so we're not allowed to plug in 0 and we're not allowed to plug in 2. we're going to have missing things there either a whole or an asymptote that's how we're saying that we have a missing thing well let's look back at the factor so x equals 0 came from x the factor x can you cancel out the x no you can't all right well if you can't then that defines a vertical asymptote at that value of x and because that's an exponent one multiplicity one that's an odd vertical asymptote so x equals zero is the y-axis so on the y-axis we have an undefined value we have a vertical asymptote that's why i said earlier you're not going to have a y-intercept you're either doing this or this on the y-axis you will not cross it you won't touch it interesting now at x equals two so let's look back at the factor x equals two came from the factor x minus two so look back at that can you cancel out the x minus two yes but wait what's what's that mean when you can cancel out a factor that's causing a domain problem a zero on your denominator that defines a removable discontinuity or in other words a hole a missing point so you can't let two go in there to your function evaluate because it causes this problem but it's just going to be one point that's removed from your from your function so at x equals two we have a whole now here's what i need you to do for a whole so this is like your step five if you have a hole you do one more thing you simplify which we've already done you rewrite your function and here's the whole point of a missing point this graph will look exactly like this graph with one exception this graph has a hole in this function so here's what we're going to do i know that i just told you hey you can't plug in two you still can't plug in two it's gonna be a whole you need to identify where that hole is so in your simplified function plug in the two we already know that we can't have it it's allow me to find the domain that way but you're going to show where that missing point is you see by saying you can't plug in 2 and say here's the hole where i can't plug into you are defining that you can't plug in that 2. you're saying there is a missing point here so we have to evaluate our simplified function at the missing value to see where the missing point is so we're going to plug in 2. already know we can't have it we're now showing that we can't have it and that it is a whole so plug in let's see uh that would be two plus two that's two squared plus four over two four times four plus four is eight four times eight is 32 that's 16. we are going to have a hole a missing point at 2 comma 16. we're going to use that when we get to gravity we're going to go over 2 on the x up 16 on the y and we're going to put a hole we're going to say oh hey our function is going to come to this hole and leave this hole but it's going to be missing a point here here's the whole thing about holes this function is exactly like this function except it's going to be missing that point that's why we define it so that's how holes interplay with these functions that's just about it all right let's go ahead to our next example so f of x equals polynomial over polynomial first thing we do because this is in standard form we're going to find end behavior now we might just look at this and go hey the degrees are equal in your head you need to be thinking if the degrees are equal i have a horizontal asymptote at the coefficients so the ratio of the leading coefficients that would be two over three or two thirds so we should get out of this that y equals two-thirds is a horizontal asymptote now we're always going to practice doing this end behavior end behaviors takes our leading terms they're power functions they should simplify at least your variables and this says no matter what you do your function as you get to positive and negative infinity is going to be two-thirds what's it mean two-thirds is a horizontal line well that would be a horizontal asymptote so no matter what you do you're gonna get to two-thirds so we define that as a horizontal asymptote at y equals positive two-thirds remember you can cross a horizontal asymptote but this function is going to tend to that value as we approach positive and negative infinity approach means as x gets closer to one value the function does that's a limit idea as x approaches some value the function gets closer and closer and closer to what value in this case as x gets to positive infinity and as x gets negative infinity the function is going to approach or get closer and closer and closer to the value two thirds point six six six six six six uh it's never going to touch it let's get closer and closer after that man we factor everything so we're going to factor the numerator and the denominator do it as quickly as you can effectively we should know factoring pretty well so i'm looking at that as negative 8 and 3 that multiplies to negative 24 that adds to negative 5. i always like to divide by my a and simplify and i know that my numerator will be factored as one x minus four and two x plus three you can factor in whatever way you're comfortable with i don't care we just need to be able to factor i probably checked my work too this would be 2x squared plus 3x minus 8x minus 5x and then minus 12. so i know i'm right it doesn't make sense to go any further unless you're actually sure about factoring if this is just a little side note if this is not factorable then we have some issues uh with a quadratic you do the quadratic formula and you'd have to factor with a quadratic it's quite annoying you're probably not going to run into that but you have to do that if it's a over a power two then you'd go back to rational zeros theorem you'd find a factor and two division like synthetic division to factor that out so it can get very very tedious you're almost certainly not going to run into that in this class but i want to prepare you for it so that we're not just limiting your ability okay uh this 3x squared minus 11x minus 4. i'm going to do that right here take my negative 11 and negative 12. that's negative 12 and 1 that adds an 8 11 multiplies to negative 12. if i divide by my a and simplify we're going to get 1x minus 4 and we're going to get 3x plus 1. and now before we go any further we're going to define our domain so we take a look at our denominator which is factored now looks great we do not cancel those out what we do is we say all right by the zero product property if x minus four equals zero we'd have an undefined value if three x plus one equals zero we'd have another undefined value let's solve those so these two values define our domain we can have any value of x as long as we don't allow 4 or negative 1 3 those would cause undefined values inside of our function that's a problem and now we're going to define what those problems create graphically so let's look back at the four four comes and factor x minus four x minus 4 we're just going to ask can you cancel that yeah and if you can then at x equals 4 we add a whole in just a moment we're going to simplify that and we're going to plug in 4 to figure out where the hole is where the missing point is where the undefined value is in our graph now at x equals negative 1 3 that came from comes from three x plus one can you cancel three x plus one uh no there's nothing to cancel there so what that says is that at x equals negative one third we're gonna have a vertical asymptote because it's a power one multiplicity one it's going to be odd so like this or like this around x equals negative x equals negative one third so we said we can't plug in that value therefore there's going to be nothing there but it's a vertical asymptote in this case we can't plug in four there should be nothing there but to be a whole in this case in both cases vertical asymptote or whole there is a missing value of x now we're going to simplify this and say all right if we cancel out x minus 4 this function is going to look exactly like this function except it's going to have a missing point we need to show where that missing point is stop for a second notice though do you notice that this function has exactly the same end behavior as this one so if you divide here's power one power one that says horizontal asymptote at coefficients that's two thirds that's exactly that do you notice that this has exactly the same vertical asymptote as this does negative one-third this says something if some and sometimes this benefits you if you have a hole sometimes you can find your end behavior easier if you cancel out the hole the problem is you don't know if you have a hole until you factor it so you might want to risk that if you think factoring is going to cancel out a factor for you then you might want to find your end behavior later because it's just a little bit easier and your vertical aspect will still appear here's the one thing you can do you can't go oh i'm just going to cancel it and this doesn't matter this absolutely matters and you need to evaluate your simplified function to find the value of that whole to find the value of that missing point so we're going to take and we're going to evaluate this for four so we're plugging in four now if i evaluate 4 that's 2 times 4 plus 3 let's see if it's 8 plus 3 that's 11 over 13. so we're going to have a missing value on our function at 4 comma 11 13. you are always going to do this here's why i've seen a lot of students go oh i have a hole at x equals four then they go to the x-axis and they put a hole that is not at all what this is saying this is saying that at the value four comma eleven thirteen so almost four comma one there is your missing point your function is going to come to that missing point it's going to leave that missing point it's going to leave that point empty this graph will look exactly like this graph except it will be missing that point so how do we do it we graph this and we take out that point that's what the hole does and it gives us that graph and that's kind of cool i'm going to come back with two more examples where we uh deal with some oblique asymptotes and then we'll be done all right here we go let's take a look at g of x first thing that we do with standard form polynomials and rational functions is find end behavior and so we're going to do that right now if this had all been factored we would fake distribute and find end behavior first anyway so that's usually the first thing we do almost all the time so we're going to take and say hey g of x in its end behavior is going to look a lot like x cubed over x squared our leading terms in ratio and simplify them this is just x to the first power here wait a minute x to the first power is a diagonal line if you think back to that video on oblique asymptotes if your numerator is larger than your denominator in terms of degree by exactly one you will have a slant or diagonal or oblique asymptote we have to find that so you have an option here with oblique asymptotes there there's kind of two cases one where you can cancel out a factor and one where you can't so if you know that you're going to be able to cancel a factor you might try to factor first and i'll show you that in that example if you don't i have no idea uh well which i do but you might try to to just do your long division to figure out your your slant asymptote um it's kind of up to you try both ways and see which one works works for you what i'm going to show you is both ways so firstly if you don't know if you're going to be able to cancel something out you're just going to have to straight up do long division right now as soon as you determine hey my end behavior is x to the first power pause that's not horizontal that's not just x equals power one you need to go a little further so we're going to take and we're going to divide x cubed minus eight by x squared minus five x plus six remember that synthetic division does not work here but we only have two steps we need to do we take first term divided by first term we distribute we subtract and we're pretty much done we don't have to bring this down i do not care all we need to do is take first term divided by first term 5x squared divided by x squared is just simply 5 plus 5. don't worry about distribution this right here this is your oblique or slant or diagonal asymptote so we'd say we have an oblique asymptote at y equals x plus five i only did one example in oblique acid fields they don't actually happen all that often for us but you only need to do two steps on your long division so as soon as you determine that is one degree more than that one do your long division do only two steps divide first term by first term we did that would be x distribute subtract term by term zero minus negative five is plus zero minus six is negative six and then do first term divided by first term five x squared divided by x squared is just positive five x plus five you're done you don't even really need to subtract this one this is your oblique asymptote for sure that's going to help us graph in the next video the next thing we do is we factor everything so that can be sort of difficult if you don't remember some of the factoring techniques like x cubed minus eight well that's a difference of cubes difference of cubes works kind of funny what we do is we take first term minus second term so x minus two and then inside the next set of parentheses you take first thing squared minus multiply them sorry plus multiply them together plus second things squared which is four we've done that a couple times but not very often so it has this formula you might want to look up this pattern that says you have the same sign and then opposite sides and then always a plus so first minus second first squared plus multiply them together and then second thing squared that would be 2 squared this thing squared this comes from the 2 times the x and this comes from the first thing squared that's how that works on our denominator well we have a fairly simple quadratic that we can factor that's negative 3 and negative 2 dividing by 1 doesn't change those so this is a pretty nice one x minus 3 and x minus 2. after that man we go right to define our domain so zero product property says x minus three equals zero x minus two equals zero x equals three and x equals two those are problems so our domain says you can't have that that bad now define what they create if you can cancel out the factor that's giving you your domain restriction as a whole if you can't it's a vertical asymptote so we look back at three comes from x minus three i cannot cancel that factor there is no x minus three that's an irreducible quadratic you could check it real quick if you want to but if you tried quadratic formula it's going to give you 4 squared minus 4 times 1 times 4. 4 squared minus 16 well that's going to give you negative 12 and you can have that and i inside of your your polynomial if you want to graph it so we know that's irreducible so this comes from this factor you cannot cancel it therefore at x equals 3 we have something we can't have but it's a vertical asymptote and because that multiplicity is 1 that creates an odd at x equals 3 we're doing this or this odd means opposite infinities for vertical asymptotes now x equals 2 comes from the factor x minus 2. so we ask can we cancel x minus 2 yeah sure enough we can what that means is that we can't allow two it's going to create for us a missing point a whole at x equals two we're going to define where that is exactly later so we know at x equals 2 there's going to be a hole we're going to have to define where that hole is so now we're going to simplify this and i want you to notice something this is i said you can sort of go back like a sort of order with oblique if you knew that that was going to cancel which some most time we don't know that you can still find your oblique asymptote from here if you wanted to divide this by this you could even do synthetic division and you get the same thing so synthetic division would say positive 3 remember positive 3 would act like an intercept here positive 3 would be 1 3 add them together 5 and that gives you right there the remainder doesn't matter doesn't matter at all this would be x plus 5 just like that is x plus 5. it actually works if you want to do long division of polynomials here you'd see the same exact thing but your end behavior cannot change if you simplify your function you're going to have the same end behavior two and one still says numerator is higher by one you still have an oblique i even showed you right there the same oblique so the same vertical asymptote you'd still have the same x-intercepts they're not going to be any here so all of that is possible after you simplify it just depends on what you start with so if you start like this sometimes easier to find end behavior just right about alright so now that we have a simplified rational function we're going to plug in that 2 to see what we get so if we evaluate g of 2 that would be 4 2 squared is 4 4 two times two is four and four so four plus four plus four i think that's 12 over two minus minus three which is negative one so we would have a hole at 2 comma negative 12. this function and this function are identical so we graph this one and then just remove one point we have a missing point the function will hit 2 comma negative 12 it will go right over it and then continue it will miss that point that's why we have this domain restriction first do not cancel out first to define your domain first and then say what that does for your graph that's what we're doing all right last one h of x equals nasty stuff well we do end behavior first and we just look at the degree we go okay then hey that's degree two over degree one the numerator has a degree one larger than denominator we will have an oblique asymptote can we do long division of polynomials of course we can could you factor this maybe because it's easy to factor yes but you have to define your domain first so make sure you do that so i'm going to show you that right now this one i showed you this way to say what if i don't know i can factor it like i showed you over here i don't know then do long division if you know that you can factor that maybe spend 10 seconds trying you might want to do that first so i'm telling you this is a little malleable these three steps are not and you have to evaluate for your whole if you do have one so we're going to show that here too but what if you know you can factor that for instance i've taught you well you're all very smart you're very good at factoring if you go yeah i can factor seven and negative three that's pretty easy i mean that that's negative 3 and 10. i know that adds a 7 that multiplies to negative 30. i know if i divide by my a and i simplify so 2 goes into 10 and sorry um and i simplify 2 goes into 10 5 times and 6 3 times three goes into three one time and six two times so i know that my numerator can factor as two x minus one and three x plus five there's a letter you tricky guy what do you do well i knew it was factorable number one because i made the problem but number two because i'm really good at factoring because i made you practice so much you guys are good at it too so maybe try to factor it why well because now we can identify right now that this which is completely factored you can't factor that anymore that right there is going to create a hole for us so we've kind of shortcutted the whole long division of polynomials uh began because of this so we go all right well what's what's that going to what's it going to do well what that does is that says okay set your denominator equal to zero and we'd say our domain says you cannot allow negative five thirds all right let's determine what that does if we look back at three x plus five the factor where we got negative five thirds you can cancel that that means that at x equals negative five thirds we're gonna have a whole now we're going to plug that in and figure out where that hole is but notice that we can simplify our function now we just get 2x minus one now i'm gonna pause because there should be just this question in your head like you should be going but wait wait you said that's two that's one you should have no oblique asymptote where'd they go oh no this is your oblique asymptote this function rides that line 2x minus one forever it is an asymptote it just happens that this function this function is going to be on it the entire time the only difference between this graph and this graph is that this graph is going to have a hole somewhere on that line that's it so can you intersect an oblique and a or a horizontal asymptote yes i made a strong point that you could in fact this function is on that oblique asymptote the entire time it is that graph if you graph two x minus one then you're going to get this function the only thing you need to exclude is one point you need to exclude negative five thirds comma whatever we're gonna get so we're gonna evaluate right now so if i plug that in negative ten thirds minus one that's going to give us negative thirteen thirds and that's where our removable discontinuity is so here's the main point in this example if you were to graph this sorry if you were to graph this function and remove this point you will get that graph that's what this means so can you graph two x minus one easily go down one that's your y intercept negative one uh go up two over one to the right that's your slope take out exactly that point and you will get exactly that function i hope that interests you i hope that's fascinating if if you want to have a minute or so if you want if you want to do this differently if you don't like the fact that i went out of order because you're like me and want everything in order i get it in the same way he said i just really want to do end behavior first that's totally fine if you want to do that and go hey look this degree is one more than that one if i thought about my power functions and simplify that you're going to get 2 x is it a coincidence of that 2x is that 2x it's not a coincidence that's the first thing that you're going to get when you do long division think about that first thing you do with long division polynomials is take first term divided by first term in it it's going to give you exactly that by the way you could do this with synthetic but you have to use negative five thirds which is a little bit awkward to use so i'm just going to do this because it's easier if we divide 6x squared by 3x we get 2x if we subtract we get zero and we get minus three x i don't even care about the minus five now you can put it and it's going to show you something else i really don't care because if we divide negative 3x by 3x we get negative 1. if i distribute which i don't even have to do this right here as we know that is your oblique asymptote we'd say oblique asymptote happens at 2x minus 1. later on we'd go and cancel this go wait a minute that function is 2x minus 1. can the oblique asymptote be your function yes but only if you're missing a point which is what that tells us that's the point so if you want to do this this would still bear out as an oblique asymptote later on you would factor this and cancel and go okay my oblique asymptote is my function it's just this function has a hole in it so oblique asymptote is your function perfectly you just take out one point which we have found anyway i hope that makes sense that's a cool question not a hard example but quite advanced because you have to understand a lot about it to get that so i hope i've made it make sense i hope i'm explaining this well enough for you next video we are going to do everything we're going to graph a whole bunch of examples it's going to be a very very long video i need you to watch it it'll be fun it'll be good times but it's going to put everything together is one of the cornerstones of this course and it leads you into calculus one and graphing functions very very well so i hope you're doing well and i hope to see you for the next video
