Transcript for: Solving Logarithmic Equations with Exponentials (Precalculus - College Algebra 63)
welcome to another video in this video we are going to finish talking about solving logarithmic equations in the last video we noticed there's a special case we have all terms that are logarithms the same base we can basically combine them and set the inside is equal this is the video that takes care of basically everything else now in the last part of this video i will talk about three what i would consider much more challenging examples i'll show you how change of base can really be helpful but in general here's what this video is going to teach you if you have at least one term that is not a logarithm then we really don't have the ability to combine everything and set insides of logarithms equal there is no no chain or no common base special case that we have in general what we're going to do is say hey look if we have some terms that are logarithms and some terms that aren't we're going to combine all the logarithms into one term on one side of the equation and leave that constant term on the other side then we'll use exponential notation to rewrite it and be able to solve something very very nicely with some techniques algebra we already know and that's basically what all this says so we identify what what category we're in are we in the we've got all logarithms of the same base let's combine them and set the insides equal or are we in the i have at least one term that's not a logarithm or logarithms with different bases in that case you have some other work to do so we take a look at that if we have one term that's not a logarithm that is a constant what we're going to do is we're going to get all logs on one side cool we're going to combine them we know how to do that and then use exponential notation basically writing in exponential form so we're going to work our way through some of these examples we've got many to do the last three are going to be fairly difficult i'll show you those but these ones that we start with not super bad so let's take a look at it uh do we have log all logarithms do you have an equation with all logarithms well no we have at least one term that's not a logarithm we're going to get everything on one side we've done that get our logarithms on one side and a constant on the other side we've got that and then what we do every time we see a logarithm x bar in the special case which we could have used exponentials for anyway every time we see a logarithmic equation you are going to need an exponential to solve it so what solves logarithms is its inverse those are exponentials well let's write this as an exponential identify our base identify our exponent notice that logarithms separate the base from the exponent so our base here is 10. remember it's not written as 10 and our exponent is 1. we can easily write these in exponential notation if we have all our logarithms combined into one logarithm and a non-zero constant even a zero constant really on the other side if you happen to get a zero constant you could have done it a different way but this will take care of it anyway so base to an exponent we simplify the exponent and then solve for our variable using a technique you will have already seen so in this case just subtract 6. as long as we make sure that this does not cause any domain issues for a logarithm remember this inside cannot become 0 and it can't be negative so plug it in that makes 10 and as a matter of fact 10 raised to the first power gives you 10 we know that our solution is 4 and that's valid so that's what we're doing here we're going to take a look at all these identify what category we're in move everything to one side combined and then using exponential let's take a look at it the first thing we do is identify so we've got a log base 2 a log base 2. it looks good and then we got 5. well that's not a logarithm therefore we can't combine and use logarithms with the same base we're going to have to get all our logarithms on one side which we have here that's good but we're also going to have to combine them you can't write one exponential if you have multiple logarithms that doesn't really work that well so we're going to have to combine these we're going to move our exponent first keep it in mind that that exponent goes on the exponent of this entire thing and we keep going we do need to work this down to be one logarithm so when we see logarithms of the same base being added we know we can make one logarithm with a product plus gives us a product inside one logarithm i'm going to encourage you not to distribute i know i've shown it one time i'm going to encourage you not to distribute this until you absolutely have to because sometimes you don't have to we're not going to have to in this example it's really important to not have to do extra work here just think about what's going to happen we have combined logarithms we have one logarithm yes that times four we probably should write this at the front equal to a constant that is something that's easily translatable into an exponential notation our base is two our exponent is five and our argument is four times x minus one to the third power we can write this really easy and exponential takes the base and the exponent and puts it back together so base to the exponent equals inside but you can only do it if you have one logarithm well now let's think about it we know in order to solve equations what we really want is the ability to factor or the ability to isolate a variable to a power and then take a radical on both sides we have that here if we go ahead and distribute all this this is already factored this looks really good in fact what we can do is maybe simplify that into 32 and what we can do is maybe isolate that power a little bit by dividing by four and once we've done that we can take a cube root of both sides had we distributed that we probably never see it so what i'm going to encourage you to do is wait to distribute until after you have written it as an exponential because sometimes you can shortcut the problem like we've done here we wouldn't have maybe seen that here this would be a lot of work so wait to distribute until you've done that step now sometimes you will have to distribute sometimes you won't have to like this case so we've isolated our variable raised to a power we know that all of our x's inside the parentheses let's take a cube root of both sides power matches the root cube root of eight is two adding one we get 3 and now we're going to check does that 3 make any of our original logarithms have a domain issue so plugging this in 3 minus 1 is 2 that looks good 4 is a constant 5 is not in the logarithm this looks fantastic this is what we want to see let's move on to the next one we got log of two x plus one equals one plus log of x minus two we're going to categorize it first so we take a look at it we think all right do i have it's obviously logarithmic do i have all logarithms well no i don't i have a constant a non-zero constant i'm going to group all my logarithms on one side because i know i'm going to have to use an exponential if you don't have all logarithms you're going to need an exponential all right we're going to need that so let's group all our logarithms and combine so that we can write it as an exponential that means subtracting log of x minus 2. that means leaving your constant and if you have more than one you group those two you get all of your constants on one side because you always can combine constants into another constant we leave that constant on the right hand side or whatever side you want now in order to write as an exponential we need to continue to write this as one logarithm of course these are the same base so we can combine these we know that two logarithms being subtracted creates one logarithm with a quotient and now we're ready this is the approach to solving a general logarithmic equation we group our logarithms on one side we have a constant on the other and then we write this in exponential notation our base is 10 our exponent is one our exponential will put that back together and now we solve this because we have a fraction let's multiply both sides by our denominator so 10 to the first power that's 10. and if we multiply both sides by x minus 2 on the right hand side we get 2x 1 on the left if we distribute that's 10x minus 20. now this is linear don't try to factor it it's not a power two you don't need to we just need to subtract a smaller variable so subtracting 2x we're going to get 8x adding 20 we're going to get 21 and dividing by 8 we get 21 array that's kind of an awkward fraction but it's more than 2 so it's like 2 point something all right 2 and 5 8. so if we have something more than 2 evaluate this just a little bit now if you want to plug it in all the way and make sure that it works that's great that you should do that but at least go this far at least make sure this does not cause a domain issue so two point something two point something times two plus one is not zero and it's positive that's good two point something minus two is not zero and it's positive that's good also this does not cause any domain issues that's a valid solution for us okay last one then we're going to step it up a little bit so we have a logarithmic equation sure thing and we have a couple logs base six but something that's not a logarithm with the same base so we're going to need an exponential in order to solve this like we do in general we always use an inverse to solve some sort of a function that's what we need here we need the inverse of a logarithm or an exponential so we're going to get all our logs on one side what that means in this case is we're going to add log base 6 of x 3. we leave the constant we want that because that stands for the exponent of the exponential we're about to create then we're going to have to combine these so because we have two logarithms with the same base being added we know a plus means a product inside one logarithm with that base of six now you can see something here i told you just a little while ago i really don't want to distribute that until i absolutely have to because sometimes we get a shortcut don't have to distribute like we saw in that example now we're going to have to distribute here because we're going to get a power tool we're going to have a factor but i don't want to do it right now i just want to make sure that we understand that one logarithm equals a constant leads us to an exponential then then acknowledge what you got to do then kind of i identify and evaluate what you need to do after that but make sure you get to the exponential before you distribute it's no harder to do and sometimes it'll save you work this is why we do it so we have a base of six an exponent of one let the exponential put those together that's going to equal the inside of your logarithm now i'm going to warn you not warn you just advise you a little bit that you're going to see a lot of ones you're gonna see some zeros occasionally which you could do a different way but you see a lot of ones and twos why well because that constant acts as an exponent if i were to give you like a seven you have six to the seventh power that's ridiculous big uh to be able to factor and really work with well so you're gonna see a lot of ones a lot of ones and twos because two the six to the second power is well that's that's 36 so we can we can do that we can work with that very well six to the first power six we can work with that two as soon as these start getting really big we start getting with some some factoring problems things that we're not able to really work with so just watch out for that not that these can't be other constants but just you're probably not going to see them very often so now that we have this exponential the only way we solve this logarithm is with an exponential we're going to have to solve it now this is going to be some techniques we understand so when we look at this we go right how do i solve it it's not the zero product property right now because i don't have a zero it is something that i don't have all of my x's grouped together raised to a power if i did i could use like a square root method or a cube root method to solve it but i don't this is where we have to distribute so we're going to distribute everything we're going to identify it's got a power 2 that means group everything on one side and factor it or quadratic formula it or if it's really bad rational zeros they're having to find yourself a root so we've distributed we go okay power two that's not zero i need to get everything on one side and factor if i can how do we try to factor what if we can't quadratic formula would work if it's power two or then like i said another techniques can have to be implemented like rational zeros something else to be able to solve that thankfully for us this factors as x plus six and x plus one we said we work that down use zero product property solve it we get negative six and negative one now we're good right uh well well no no the whole point of a lot of the things i've said about domain is so that right now you can identify which of these is good or valid in the domain of our logarithms you see they both have to work to be solutions um if one of them doesn't work we're going to cross it out now both of them are negative don't just arbitrarily cross out negatives i see it a lot that's not what we're talking about we actually have to check whether this number makes any one of our original logarithms have a domain problem have an argument that becomes negative or zero even so take the negative six negative six plus four is negative two you're done i don't care if it works in the next one or not you're done this is not a valid solution it doesn't have to be invalid for all of them even one of them will cause it to not be okay because it causes domain issue sometimes when we combine these and multiply we take we take it negative and becomes like it's a it makes it look like it's a valid solution when it's not so let's look at the next one negative 1. now while this is a negative value when i evaluate negative 1 plus 4 is 3 and negative 1 plus 3 is 2 those are not negative and they're not 0. this doesn't cause a domain issue so even though that's negative it's fine it's going to be a valid solution we just don't want values that when we plug them in or evaluate they cause domain problems this one's okay so that's the thought process i want you going through when we're solving logarithmic equations do we have all logarithms of the same base use common bases do we not use an exponential we're going to move on and see it we're going to start making this a little bit more difficult so by the end of it we're going to deal with some fairly complicated problems hang on for it all right ready for another example so let's take a look at it we're noticing it's a logarithmic equation we're also noticing not everything is a logarithm so now we have everything grouped on one side for our logarithms and a non-zero constant that looks really good we're going to combine our logarithms we know that two logarithms being subtracted the same base will give us one logarithm with a quotient where all of our positive or added logarithms create factors on the numerator and subtracted or negative logarithms create factors in the denominator now i'm going to pause here this is the reason why i'm giving this example um it really helps a lot of times to factor not distribute but factor your your logarithms especially the fractions because if you can simplify them you can actually make your problem easier without affecting your solution i'll show you in just a minute why that's true but you can do it you say wait wait a minute that x squared my signs look like a difference of squares and it's gonna have a factor of x plus three can we simplify the factor of x plus three yes and we get log base 4 of x minus 3 equals 3. well that that's a logarithm can we identify the base and exponent sure can we write it as exponential notation yeah of course four to the third equals x minus three sixty-four equals x minus three and x equals sixty-seven now would we get the same answer if we hadn't simplified that yeah we would is there a different way to not simplify yeah there is i'll show you both of those things right now firstly here's one reason why we're able to simplify this just by another look at it and not affect our final solution so here also keep in mind that we're not running into this whole oh i have a hole in this graph we're not really doing that because we're not dividing by something that equals zero you see this can't ever equal zero so at x equals negative three we don't have a defined point because that's not defined even for our logarithm so we're not really around that issue we're just literally crossing out something that's not a solution i'll show you a different way what if we considered this to be x minus 3 x plus 3 from right here and what if we expanded that we know that because we can combine addition and get multiplication or product instead of one logarithm we can expand a product and get addition because we can do that can you see that this is just combining terms if you have a log base four of x plus three minus log base four x plus three you add two things well if you add the opposites of these two terms you're gonna get zero that's exactly what's happening here this is going to cancel out if you will and you end up getting the exact same thing that we got right here well i know the third case what if you didn't see this and you ended up saying all right from here base to the exponent equals my entire argument there are you all right well let's see um this would be 64. and if you multiply both sides by x plus three we have 64x plus 192 equals x squared minus nine now you've got a power two we gotta get everything on one side and zero on the other side so x squared minus 64 x minus 201 and then you got to factor it you go i don't want to i don't want to either because those numbers are really big but it does factor negative 67 and 3 adds to negative 64 and negative 67 times 3 is negative 201 so this factors as negative x minus 67 x plus three zero product property if we did really quickly gives us positive 67 and negative three well now wait a minute that's the 67 what about that one why doesn't this have that solution look carefully at that solution if you were to evaluate negative three right there negative 3 plus 3 is 0. this is exactly the domain problem that we said that have has you can't even plug in negative 3. so why does it appear it appears right here when you multiply both sides by x plus three it allows this a factor that gives you something that's not even allowed to start with which is why we cross it out at the end so is this way better yes it doesn't cause any problems and it eliminates the factor that has the domain problem anyway so try that if you have to combine your logarithms i'm always thinking can i simplify that can i simplify that argument before i start doing any algebra because obviously it's a lot easier to do i hope that makes sense to you i hope that you kind of see my point on that okay last one and then we're going to go on to some special case ones that are that involve some changing of a base make things a little more difficult i'll say it's uh it'd be kind of optional i would hope that you'd want to watch it and kind of enjoy it be a little bit more uh more critical thinking a little bit more problem solving in it uh so this this last one yeah it's logarithmic yeah we have logs of the same base but we also have one term that's not a logarithm that's a constant in general you combine your constants put on one side all your logarithms on the other and then we're going to have to use an exponential but only after we combine our logarithms so how to combine them because we have two logs same base being subtracted we create one logarithm with a quotient hopefully done correctly now that is set up perfectly for writing an exponential notation from that so our our base is e our exponent is two x dimensional notation takes those and writes them back the way they should be as an exponent so e to the second equals this x plus one over x now how in the world are we going to solve that we're going to see this technique an awful lot when we get into the next video which has to do with solving exponentials it's the same technique i actually showed you when we solved for inverse functions the way that you need to group your x terms factor x and then divide so whenever you see something like this where you're multiplying both sides of the denominator a lot of times if you have an awkwardness like another variable or like some sort of constant that you can't really deal with very well like e squared this is the technique that we should be using so let's multiply both sides by x we're going to have to do that but right here where you see all of those x's floating around if x is here x is here and you're trying to solve for x this should kind of remind you of what happened when we had logarithms we were trying to solve for y we grouped oh sorry uh when we were trying to solve for inverses we grouped all of our y terms on one side because we were solving for y then we factored the y and we divided we're trying to solve for x here but the same logic applies let's group all of our x terms on one side so subtracting x let's do that x times e squared minus x equals 1. now we're going to factor the x and because we factored it creates a product and products can be solved well we can solve for variable involving a product by dividing let's divide both sides by e squared minus one it looks awkward but that is your solution um also i want you to notice that that's a positive number so 1 divided by e squared e squared remember e is about 2.7 so 2.7 squared is larger than 1 something larger than 1 minus 1 is positive positive over positive is a positive if we try to evaluate that that is positive and that is positive it doesn't cause a domain issue for us now you also might want to find what's called an approximate solution so this is exact this is this is exactly all the numbers wrapped up into that but if you had to find an approximation you take your calculator do 1 divided by and use parentheses e squared you usually have to press second to get to e e squared and then minus one close parenthesis it'll give you a decimal approximation for that solution so i'm hoping this is this has made sense so far hoping you're seeing what in the absence of all logarithms you need exponentials they're not that hard you just have to identify get all your logs on one side combine them appropriately using exponential and they're usually pretty not so bad to solve we're going to come back with three more that are more difficult be right back we're going to do three more and we're going to do these three together because they all involve using the change of base formula for logarithms in there somewhere and i think that i think is really cool first off and secondly i think it leads to a lot of a lot of mistakes with students because they get stuck and they never really see this mo most classes i've seen or observed or taught myself really kind of bypass these sort of problems because they're difficult um and because you don't see a lot of them but they're really really neat and i don't want to limit once you understand and so here's how we're going to go through these we're going to see hopefully that having the same base is really helpful for logarithms and we get really stuck when we don't have that so we need a way to to work around that um so we're going to take a look at what happens when we don't have the same base and at the end of these three examples you're going to ask me well yes leonard but you changed one base into another what if you can't change either one then i'll give you one last example so i guess i use four examples so let's take a look at it now this looks all great we look at this and try to categorize and go i got i got two logarithms that's true i don't need constants that's also true um oh wait but i don't have the same base we can use a change of base formula in in a slightly different way than i've told you before so i've told you that you can change one logarithm into whatever base you want and that's true and i also told you we typically choose common log or natural log that's also true but sometimes we can use the change of base formula to change a base that we don't want into something we do want just remember how this works with the change of base you pick whatever base you want and you take logarithm of the argument on the numerator logarithmic a logarithm of the base on the denominator and pick whatever new base you want typically it's a common log of your natural log but what if we did this let me say it all right with this logarithm i want to take a logarithm of my numerator over a logarithm of my did not of my sorry logarithm my argument as my numerator and logarithm of my base is my denominator and i can pick whatever base i want please notice how change of base works this goes on top this goes on bottom and pick whatever base you want it to be well what base do i want i i want i want that base so i want a base of three a lot of these problems because they're contrived they simplify very nicely for instance log base 3 of 7x minus 5 that doesn't simplify but log base 3 of 9 is 2 because it has 3 raised to what power is 9. 2. this is an exponent it's an exponent of 2. so when we do simplify it now we have something that looks a little bit nicer we go this is what looks familiar we have logarithms everywhere with the same base we do need to isolate and so we have one log equal to another log with the same base which means we're going to multiply both sides by 2. so multiplying both sides by two no wait a minute that made it worse didn't make it worse because now we can take a coefficient and move it as an exponent this is the i this is the fundamental concept of having logarithms of the same base if you have logarithms set equal to another they have the same base you isolate it or while at least you made it so that adds a factor to multiplied well that means that your insides have to be equal as well so logarithms equal to one another means you can set your arguments equal so seven x minus five equals x plus one squared now that might look a little bit complicated but it is something we've seen before we're going to distribute everything it's going to give us a power to we're going to get everything on one side we're going to factor it i know i'm working pretty quickly but this is nothing we haven't seen before zero prime property will tell us that x is three and x is two now we're gonna check both of those so take these back into your original and just make sure they don't give you a zero or negative so three that's 21 minus five that's not zero or negative uh four is not zero or negative plugging in two fourteen minus five isn't zero or negative two plus one isn't zero or negative these are both valid solutions they work just fine so sometimes it helps us to use change of base change the basis of what you want hopefully it simplifies now if it doesn't this becomes a little bit of a nightmare but if it does you get something very nice and most of the problems you run into that simplifies a little bit i will give you one at the end that has completely different bases and what we do with that okay moving right along and i hope that you're starting to see or you will see in this example that there is some similarity between working with common bases and logarithms and those of exponents so we have logarithms here and we have a logarithm or we have one term that's not a logarithm so we're going to have to use an exponential but in our case here we're noticing that our bases are not the same we need them to become the same if we're going to combine them and so we're going to use the change of base formula look at your bases and much like exponentials try to write them all as the same base so i've got a base of 2. that looks really good a base of 4 and a base of 16 are going to need to change so we're going to take each of these two logarithms write them with a base of 2. so because of our change of base we can say i'm going to write this as a ratio log of x over log of 16 inside on the numerator base on the denominator and then pick whatever base you want in this case i want to find a base of 2 why because that's the lowest base that's the one that i can make everything into or the most common base we can say too same thing's going to happen here i'm going to have a log of x over a log of 4. pick whatever base you want now to be kind of silly i would pick a different basement to be size two because i'm trying to combine here since we already have a base of two this last logarithm looks pretty good i hope it makes sense we hope you're seeing that this represents the same thing we could go change the base in reverse if we wanted to log base 2 of x over log base 2 of 16 is log base 16 of x it's the same thing by our change of base formula we're just picking a base of two we're going this way so we're saying yeah take your argument put in the numerator based put on the denominator and pick whatever base you want that helps your problem now look at our denominators they each simplify so log base 2 of 16 it's asked 2 raised to what power gives you 16. it's going to be 4. 2 raised to what power gives you 4 it's going to be 2. and what in the world do you do here well we are going to have a simplify this somehow aren't we so we can choose a couple things we can choose number one if you want to we can take each of these make it one-fourth and move it as exponent one-half move it to an exponent and that would become a fourth root and a square root and that's perfectly fine to do we can do that right now or you can multiply everything by an lcd of four and that's going to give you log base 2 of x 2 log base 2 of x 4 log base 2 of x and 4 times 7 which is 28 either way is fine the second way we'll deal with larger numbers so i can show you both ways here's option 1 what i said if that's a 1 4 now we know that we have to combine these all to one logarithm that means your x your coefficients have to become exponents and that means that that's really a fourth root and that's really a square root you go wait a minute i can't have any negatives inside there yeah but you couldn't anyway you can't have a negative inside that no matter what so it doesn't really matter you're not breaking domain issues here and then i would say don't change into fourth roots and square roots that's what they represent but don't write them as that we are now ready at log base two and log base two and log base two they're all added we are ready to multiply these arguments together create one model with them remember that when we multiply i'm going to write x to the first power on purpose here when we multiply we add exponents so let's see seven fourths this is one logarithm it's equal to a non-zero constant it's got a base of two we're actually ready to write this as exponential notation so we have two to the seventh equals x to the seven fourths how in the world we're going to do that uh well there's a number of ways you could do it i would say the easiest way is the way i'm going to show you that's why i show it to you because i think it's the easy way you could write this as a fourth root of x to the seventh couldn't you take both sides to the fourth power and then take a seventh root of both sides you could do that or you could be really smart with your fractional exponent and this is what i'm going to choose to do so if you're really smart with the fraction exponent i want you to think of what you need to multiply by to make that one in order to make that one i'd have to multiply by 4 7 the reciprocal the only way that we can multiply is to raise an exponent to an exponent so raise both sides to the 4 7. on the right hand side 4 7 times 7 4 just one that's x to the first power that's what you want you want to solve for x on the left hand side notice what you're really doing you have seven over one times four over seven sevens are cancelling you're going to get four over one and two to the fourth is 16. and that is your solution and works here too so uh positive positive positive and not zero that looks really good that's your solution how would it look different if you did it differently how would it look different if you wrote this as that you'd have to raise both sides to the fourth power raised to the fourth power you get 28 and you get x to the seventh and then you would have to take a seventh root of this now that's not bad you can do it and there's some shortcuts to it here that's really nice your power matches root you're good to go on the left hand side you just gotta be smart about it um now your calculator will do 2 to the 28th power it's really big and it will do a 7th root of it and that will make it 16. but if you had anything larger much larger than 2 to the 20th power your calculator will explode and start burning and say error or system overload killing me if we're really smart about it we can think about this differently which is essentially what we've done here think about 2 to the 28th as something to the 7th power well that would be 2 to the 4th power of the 7 but still to the 20th power but the power matches the root 2 to the 4th is 16. it's the same thing now i said you could also do differently for the third different way what if you ended up multiplying everything by 4 to get rid of your fractions if you did that everything times 4 to get rid of fractions then multiplying this entire thing by 4 would give you log base of x plus 4 times 2 times 1 half is 2 2 log base 2 of x 4 times log base 2 of x is 4. log base 2 of x and 28. maybe you can see what's going to happen we still have to move these as exponents we still have to combine this here's one two and four when we combine by multiplication you add exponents that's x to the seventh power you still have to change them exponentially 2 to the 28 equals x to the 7th now we're right back down there so it all yields the same thing yields 16. honestly i would think of the fractions as easier i mean it seems counter to like my fraction is going to be easier but they really are if you leave them as fractions and add them together correctly then you can raise both sides to the reciprocal it's just fine it's going to work great this is why it's a more advanced problem because you have some of these ideas going on but i really hope you're seeing the combination of ideas i'm trying to show you that radicals involved in this are very relevant that we can use some tools in our arsenal to combine things and be smart about solving so i hope that's making sense to you okay last one before our last one and man they're both going to look really nasty you know that that's horrible because we have different bases floating around we got stuff being squared we got all sorts of things there's two ideas i really need you to see three ideas five ideas there's at least three a's i really need to see number one we have different bases logarithms are going to have to have the same base to combine them so we're going to work on that number two when you see something being squared and multiplied like three times something else and you can make them the same base you are typically going to use a substitution or some other technique to solve it and thirdly you need to check for simplification of some logarithms that can be simplified if we don't see that it's going to make this problem brutal if we do see that that is 4 to make this problem easy so let's get started with the fundamental problem that we have different bases here we need to get the same base for our logarithms and so we're going to do that so we take a look at it all right uh that's a that's a base four that's a base eight i can't make a base eight into a base four very nicely and have it simplify because these are talking about what exponent it takes so i don't want to deal with a base 4 because we'd have down here log base 4 of 8. well that would be an issue because 4 raised to what power is 8 i don't know not easy but both of them can be simplified with a base of 2. this kind of shows you that like oh i got a base of 2. that's why it's there it's like a little hint usually i would just put four and make you think about that go well the base of four doesn't help a base of two a sub base on both of those would help so i'm going to change both of those into a base of two that way i can simplify both of them and still have the same base the log base 4 of 8 will not work well log base 2 of 8 is 3 that's very nice so let's go ahead and change these into a log base 2. i'm going to leave that there so that you can see the problem of not changing it so log base 4 of x thinking i need the base 4 and the base a to both become base 2 so the same and we can simplify i'm going to pick a log base 2 of x log base 2 of 4 inside numerator base denominator argument attic base basement so i think about it not very mathy but it works and pick whatever base you want i'm picking 2 why because this will simplify and i can have the same base here and that will also simplify argument attic base basement pick whatever base you want but because we're being smart about it we're picking the same base we're picking a base of two now we're going to simplify all of the things that we can in those fractions i hope you're noticing why the parentheses are necessary when you write a fraction out of that both the numerator denominator are going to get squared that's really important we can't forget about that so this is going to be log base 2 of x this log base 2 of 4 says 2 raised to what power is 4. well 2 raised to the second power is 4 this is a 2 log base 2 of x but this asks 2 raised to what power is 8 two raised to the third power is eight that's three now three simplifies to three and that's a wonderful thing this right here says log base two of x over 2 but this is squared and this is also squared we're going to leave this as a power 2 because we are going to use the substitution just a second but we're going to simplify this one squared and that's four we can simplify that and now i can do a couple things but there's one thing i can't do it's a breaking of the rules of logarithms and you can't do it you cannot move this as a one-half here and then move it here that breaks order operations because you're taking multiplication ahead of exponents and you can't do that you also cannot move this two to the front because this is not an exponent on the argument it's the entire logarithm and you can't do it you've got to follow the rules here that would break the order operations you can't do that what we can do after rewriting it is multiply both sides every term by 2 or lcd that's appropriate you cannot move this here as an exponent you cannot move the series of one-half and cancel out that power 2. you cannot move this up front this is not a power on the x you can't do any of those things you got to follow the rules exactly don't make up your own math you can multiply everything by 2. so i want you to know something right now that that log base 2 of 16 can be simplified if we don't we have a real big problem doing a substitution i need you to to remember that this thing's going to screw you up in about 5 minutes if we don't change it so i'm going to change that it asks 2 raised to what power 16 that's going to be 4. and then i'm going to multiply both sides by 2. if i distribute 2 and over 2 that's going to cancel i'm going to get log base 2 of x squared plus this distributes 2 log base 2 of x and i'm going to leave it like that equals 8. now why am i going to leave it like that a lot of times when you see something like an exponent or a logarithm one part squared and the same thing or you've made the same thing and it's another term you want to do a substitution and so we're going to do that right now we're going to say you know what if i let let's call it u u equals log base 2 of x then i can replace this with u and get u squared plus two u equals eight well wait a minute that'll be a quadratic in terms of u if there's a quadratic in terms of u i can replace and get u squared plus two that's u equals eight all power twos should be got on one side factored and simplify factor to use zero product property or quadratic formula or some other technique if you can't isolate the power 2 which we can't and this does factor but notice something i ask you to remember something i asked remember what if this didn't simplify and was left as log base 2 of 16. right here you'd have a real big problem because you'd have to use some quadratic formula with a really awkward logarithm it's still a constant you can still do it but again very very very challenging so if it happens uh double check to see if that's not simplifiable so we can here that's where we got the eight from made it much nicer and this does factor u equals negative four and u equals two and now we go back we go all right how's that going to work well because u equals a logarithm base 2 of x we know that if u equals negative 4 log base 2 of x equals negative 4 it is okay to have a logarithm equal to a negative what's not okay is to have an exponential equal to a negative it's also not okay to have it inside of a logarithm and negative and now we have oh man i hope you see it i hope you see that this is exactly what we want we want one logarithm isolated equal to a constant we have it we can write this as an exponential base of 2 exponent of negative 4 equals our inside it's solved and exponential solves logarithms this is just 1 over 16. we have one logarithm isolated equal to a constant we can use an exponential base of 2 exponent 2 equals x that's 4 equals x both of those are valid those are both solutions for that logarithmic equation now that was kind of helpfully fun i enjoyed it um hopefully you see some utility what i'm showing you that we can use the substitution and really really with change of base get some powerful stuff out of it i'm going to come back with one more to say what if your bases can't remain the same and then we'll be done all right last one uh this is gonna be kind of weird a little bit harder than other ones because we gotta really think outside the box and some some fractions not super outside the box but a little bit um well now what's the main problem here we take a look at it and go firstly it's math that's always a problem we call them problems for a reason uh secondly we go there's some logarithms and there's a constant so we have the need for an exponential somewhere in this problem but we don't have common bases and i can't change them both to the same base nicely so you know what i mean that in all the previous examples we had like this sub base we're all like a base 2 or a base 3 or something like that we don't have that here we've got log base 2 log base 6. i can't change them both into some some simplifiable expression on the denominator so like log base 2 of what gives you a gives us 6. uh well sorry 2 raised to what power gives you 6. it's not going to happen so that's that's an issue so here's what to do in this case follow the same steps i've given you make sure that we're seeing like if i have a constant i'm going to get all my logs on one side we're going to do that also i want to say i'm going to show you log base different bases being added the subtraction would work very similarly but you'd get a quotient instead of a product like we're going to get or something inspected a little differently so i'm not going to show that to you but uh but it is possible so you follow the same type of steps here so log base 2 of x plus log base 6 of x equals 3. you all right in the previous examples i was able to get a common sub base and i don't have that here so what to do when that doesn't happen is pick ln or log base 10 you have to pick some other base and the change in base says you can pick whatever you want but if you can't make them both the same pick ln it's a little easier to write pick log with them you can do that too but we're going to have to do that so i'm going to use ln ln x over ln2 i've taken argument on the numerator base on the denominator i've picked a base of e now inherently that does make the base the same doesn't it so pick the same thing don't be picking natural log here and common log there like log base e and log base 10 that would be kind of silly but change these into the same log we just don't have the ability to simplify our denominators like we did in the previous examples which makes it a little more challenging fraction wise we still have equal to 3. now we're gonna have to combine our logarithms aren't we like like we did all the other times because in order to use an exponential you have to have one logarithm on one side but the problem is in order to add fractions you have to have a common denominator well we're gonna have to get one which means that we're going to multiply by some missing pieces namely ln2 and ln6 so our lcd would be ln 2 times ln 6. we're missing a factor of ln6 we're missing a factor of ln2 so that's going to give us ln 6 times ln x i'm writing that multiplication there on purpose so you see some in a minute over ln 6 times ln2 plus ln x times ln 2 over ln 6 times ln2 that's what a common denominator is and that's how we're able to add subtract fractions so we're going to do that common denominators do not get added but on our numerator we see some some stuff that looks kind of confusing like what in the world are we going to do oh man i hope you see it this is not the fourth time you've seen this think back to what we did with inverses think back to the example we did on this video when you have x's floating around you need to group them and if you can't straight up add them factor them don't both of these terms have ln x as a factor something to be multiplied then yes then we have a greatest common factor the greatest common factor is l and x we're going to factor that so factoring l and x we would get ln x times ln 6 plus ln2 we might want to do one more thing just to make things nicer uh do you remember that if i had logarithms added together same base i can make one logarithm with the same base of our product so ln 6 plus ln2 equals ln 12 6 times 2 is 12. and now we're going to solve for ln x you could have multiplied both sides by your denominator here that that would would be appropriate you could even do it here that would be fine doesn't really matter after you create your common denominator but this may be a little bit nicer you can see your x you can see that i'm divided by this i need to multiply both sides by that so multiplying both sides by ln 6 ln 2 that would simplify and get 3 times ln 6 and ln 2. now i do want to i set my l and x but i need to get rid of my l and 12. let's divide both sides by lm12 what not to do don't try to combine those you cannot get l and 12 out of that at all you could combine ln 6 plus l and 2 l and 12. we've done that actually but this is not ln 12. you do not get to make up your own math you just multiply arguments if you want to these do not simplify don't simplify them you can't simplify them you're practically done on this side of your equation the only thing we have to do now is realize that this is precisely what we wanted we have now isolated a constant on one side and a logarithm without anything added subtracted multiplied nothing over here this is just a logarithm with a base of e our variables in there and this is actually a constant i know it looks weird but if you plug that in your calculator you would get a constant out of it now as soon as we do that as soon as we isolate our logarithm we write this as an exponential so our base is e our exponent is nasty crap and if we say base of e to nasty crap that's going to equal x it's going to solve the force it's going to look weird so e to the all this stuff as an exponent that is x that's called an exact solution uh that's that's about as good as we can make that it looks nasty if you haven't approximated you press second and the ln button that's going to pop up e with the parentheses and you plug in all that stuff um and then make sure you use parentheses appropriately and they'll give you a decimal approximation but it is a constant i know it looks weird but hopefully you're able to follow me hopefully understand like if i don't have common bases it makes our work a lot more difficult um again for the last time that was a minus you could still do this you find common denominator but when you combined you would get a if you got a minus you could come down here and when you factor you just get a minus right there but the same idea would work that's where i'm going to leave you on this i hope you followed i hope it was interesting to you i kind of enjoy working with the logarithms as hopefully you can tell i hope it is making sense though um i'll see you for another video we're going to talk about how to solve exponential equations we'll see a lot of the same ideas in these these techniques like can you use a substitution and for exponentials we're going to see that so hope you're enjoying it i'll see you later
