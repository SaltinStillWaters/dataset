Transcript for: Introduction to Solving Quadratics (Precalculus - College Algebra 16)
hi welcome to another video so in this video which is going to be very brief we're going to talk about what it is you are doing when we are solving quadratic equations a lot of times in my experience teaching for a long time students will get here and they will know sort of how to factor and they'll know sort of what the square root method is and they'll kind of know how to complete the square and they will be able to do the quadratic formula but they lose track of what it is that we are finding so I'm going to talk about that very briefly what we're doing what a quadratic is what you're doing how to solve the x-intercepts or the roots of the zeros the four methods that we talked about that will introduce that and then we go in some more videos on how to actually accomplish those things so what a quadratic function is is something with a power to a polynomial where the largest power is to or the degree is 2 it looks like that in general now what these all make we know this is some sort of a parabola it is positive it opens upward if a is negative it opens downward tells us kind of the stretch of compression also when you find - it's very easily but in general all of these things are parabolas now if we want to find out where this parabola crosses the x-axis if it does cross the x-axis or where any function like ever crosses the x-axis what we do is we set that function equal to zero why why would we do this to find out where we cross the x-axis well if f of X represents the height of our function and we say I want to find out all the x-values notice the X is not something that the X isn't something we have is something with looking for says find the x when the height is zero okay when my height is zero find me the X that gives me a height of zero notice if the height of zero is the height of our x axis which it is says the height of zero is on this axis and we're looking for X's that give us that height we are going to find x-values where our function is on the x axis those are called x-intercepts those are called zeros those are sometimes called roots of the function that is what we are doing so in order to find out our x-intercepts routes are reserved or zeros we set our function equal to zero because we're the height zero we are going to be on the x-axis and those X values will be where that function crosses the x axis that's what we're looking for now what we do specifically in quadratics so I'll write if I'm going to set my function equal to zero I'm gonna replace f of X with zero it's going to look extremely familiar we just get our function equal to zero and that's something we've been dealing with for a long time like most of like an intermediate algebra class it deals with stuff like that why because it's so important the problem is is that sometimes we learn techniques without understanding what we are doing so if you if you look at this you recognize that you go yeah I would I would probably use one of four things to solve that yeah exactly what would you use well we would use the square root method if possible if we can isolate the power to without any other X's floating around everything's inside of a power to we can take a square root of both sides that's the square root method we've done that before or if you say all right well I can't do that maybe I try factoring why would we factor because it solves this for you it factors this you can use zero product property we can factor okay what if that didn't work well I can try completing the square it is valuable we're going to talk about that I'm gonna make it very easy for you generally we don't use it a whole lot in solving quadratics because we go right to the quadratic formula can I use the quadratic formula here absolutely and so those four things I need to understand that when you're doing that when you are using the square root method when you are factoring and setting equal to zero when you are completing the square it's solving for x when you were doing the quadratic formula and finding x minus negative b plus or minus radical whatever the quadratic formula you're doing the same exact thing what we're doing is we're finding out where this function has a height of zero which will be on the x axis which would give us x intercepts so doing this no matter what technique you are doing you are finding x-intercepts or zeros or roots as they're sometimes called that's what you're doing so why do we have four techniques well because some are easy but they don't work all the time some work all the time but they're kind of difficult we using the sort of last resorts so that's what we're doing that's why we're studying the next four videos four or five videos about how to solve these things so what's the look of it what can we get out of it that's what we talk about first so number one idea what we're doing is we are finding x-intercepts when you're setting a function equal to zero so all of the techniques were about to unpack everything you know about it what you've probably seen is finding that they're finding zeros now what can what can we actually get it if we know that a quadratic gives us a parabola there's really only three cases that we can we can find it as far as it's x-intercepts are concerned we can have the first case which is very common where a proactive parabola crosses the x axis two times in this case we would have two x-intercepts can a parabola cross the x axis more than two times no no no that's impossible because this goes on forever and ever and ever in the upward-opening direction could you have it backwards well upside down and have sort of a an upside-down opening probably yes and and I need you to understand that but really I'm just going to give you the upward-opening cases here keep in mind if we reflect this then you would still have two x-intercepts no problem so this is the maximum number of x-intercepts that we can get or zeroes that are real zeroes that we can get so number one this is sort of what we get a lot of times in in factory because we don't have we don't have this case where we have imaginary numbers we have real x-intercepts this we have two solutions no matter what technique you use there are two real solutions and there are two real x-intercepts now could you have less than two x-intercepts yes but my stadia that you can't ever have less than two solutions now one we're gonna it's gonna be kind of tricky this next I want to talk about you know well there's only one solution yeah but you get it twice it's called the double root what can happen is this this parabola can touch something some textbooks a touch some say balance some say now there's usually two ones so if I if I think about this parabola getting moved up another enough what's going to happen to our x-intercepts is as this parabola moves up they're going to get closer and closer to closer until the vertex is sitting right on the x-axis this is kind of a special case of parabolas where we don't really get two different solutions we get the same solution twice and that's called that's called a double root and we'll talk about that in our techniques as we go through like how the square root method can give you well yeah how can give you the same number twice or how a factory gave you the same number twice or how a quadratic formula can be the same thing so in this case we only get one unique solution sometimes we can get it twice it shows up in our techniques but this is the only case we get one solution there would be one x-intercept 1:01 root so that's this that's the same case we can we can cross it across once we're going to cross twice we can balance or touch in that case we don't cross it we just our vertex it's right on the x-axis it is still an x-intercept but there's only one of them the last case what if you move this to the Spratly just a little higher is it gonna cross the x-axis at all the answer of course no the parabola would completely miss it and if it's upside-down it would miss it below in this case what's going to happen is that when you're solving on any of our techniques you are not going to get real so as you roll up why aren't they real they would have Eisen they'd have an imaginary component to it so it would be this imaginary number as part of our solution or a complex solution and that's exactly what we get here we will still get two solutions but they're not going to be real solutions they're going to be imaginary solutions signifying that you're not going to have an x-intercept so if you're ever working through these techniques and you get to real numbers that means there's no eyes in you or even found you know that that parabola is going to cross the x-axis since these are all parabolas that we're talking about in quadratics you would know that by not obtaining any eye any complex part of this complex solution you're going to cross the x-axis two times if we get one solution no I were balancing right off the x-axis that would be one x-intercept one real solution if we get no real numbers so that would be two conflicts and they always come in pairs if you get one you automatically get two complex conjugates we'll talk about that much later but if you get no real solutions if you get two complex solutions we know that that parabola is missing the x axis either both above or below and so it says that that would have two solutions yeah but they're complex and there would be no x-intercepts so that's that sort of ability needs to know just a little recap here what we're doing is we're saying these things are all parabolas and we're going to solve them what's solving means solving means that we're going to be finding x-intercepts zeros roots we're finding basically where this parabola has a height of zero that means where the parabola crosses the x-axis bounces out the x axis that means set your function equal to that height and solve for x solve for the X's that give me a height of zero that's going to give me the X values where the parabola crosses or any function in general crosses or touches the x axis we can have only three cases we have one where we cross it twice either upward opening or downward that's going to be two solutions two real solutions to x-intercepts you will have no lies here nothing imaginary we could have one real solution you generally get the same number twice what that means is that our x-intercepts yeah there's two of them but they're the same point what's that mean that means that we're bouncing off the x axis that would be one real solution there will be no eyes no complex number here but only one x-intercept you're bouncing the vertex will be on your x axis doing this if you see this you will have found your vertex it's an important point for us to know last one if we get complex solutions out of a quadratic there will be two of them they will have eyes in them and what that means is that you will not be crossing or touching or anyway interacting with that x axis on your on your parabola so why this is important it's because we're not going to be graphing all of our parabolas we will grab some of them but we want to know even without graphing them whether we cross twice touch once or whether we miss it completely and that comes down to our solutions having two real one real or two complex I hope that makes sense that's what you're doing with all of the next techniques in the next like four to five to six videos that we're going to be we're gonna be talking about so we're gonna start the next video we'll talk about the the square root method and we'll go there you
