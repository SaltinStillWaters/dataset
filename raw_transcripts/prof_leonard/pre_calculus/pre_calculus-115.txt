Transcript for: How to Graph Advanced Polar Equations with Symmetry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 42)
hey there welcome to another video the last video in this entire series yes feels good right kind of done moving on a little maybe sad i don't know a little bit a little bit sad i could do more trigonometry like this don't worry you will because in calculus a ton of trigonometry but this is important uh because we're going to talk about symmetry as it involves polar equations you see there's some equations like that one that when you translate them into rectangular they don't work so well and they look really really bad very hard to deal with and you can try go ahead and try to change that into rectangular equations you'll see what i mean you'll see how there's a couple hiccups what am i supposed to do with that it's not a circle it's definitely not a circle and not an ellipse not any of these conic sections we're used to and so that that's quite difficult so what do you do you leave it in polar and you learn symmetry so here's the idea behind the following four examples if these are too hard to change to rectangular we're going to leave them we're going to learn about symmetry and then plug in some points to deal with a smaller section and use symmetry to kind of mirror it so here's how symmetry works for polar equations if you're theta and negative theta if you plug in negative theta and it gives you the same exact equation that you started with so basically it's it acts like an even function if that's the case then you're going to have symmetry in your graph and it's going to be symmetric about the polar axis or the x-axis now think about why that would happen if you have a positive angle and a negative angle and it gives you out the same exact points you're going to be mirrored across this polar axis it's going to give you the same exact values that's like the x-axis so we're going to check that first if you plug in negative sorry pi minus theta into your equation and it gives you the same exact thing as you started with you're going to have symmetry about pi over 2. now hopefully that makes sense here's pi over 2. like this y-axis pi is 180 degrees zero is over here your polar axis if pi minus your angle is the same thing as your angle then you're going to get symmetry across this mirror image across the y axis you'll have that very similar to what we did with um with the double solution for the side uh side side angle for for sine how that would give us these two solutions because we had 180 minus theta matching up with our theta with sine that's exactly what this is talking about lastly if you can change just the value of your r the sine of your r and it gives you the same exact answers what you start with same exact equation then you're symmetric about the pole why because if your pole is here and r and negative r give you the same exact result you're going to be symmetric about that pole it's going to mirror image across that 180 degrees should be identical so this is the order of business for us really check to see if you could change it into rectangular easily normally when you have stuff added or subtracted it's not easy and it won't give you anything very nice so we can check that but then go through all of our symmetry so we're going to try it we're going to try every one of these i'll walk you through it very nicely after you've checked symmetry see what works see what doesn't work and it will limit the points that you have to plug in so then i'll show you how to plug in certain values like negative pi over 2 negative pi over 3 negative pi over 4 negative pi over 6 0 pi over 6 pi over 4 pi over 3 pi over 2 get a series of points and then plug them in plot them and use your symmetry to mirror image so we're going to start there how about r equals 1 minus sine theta man going to rectangular equations as possible but it won't give us anything nice because of that if you multiply both sides by r that would be easy that'd be y that would be easier the x squared plus y squared that would not be easy that would be r you'd have a square root of x squared plus y squared it's not nice to deal with so we're going to avoid that what we're not going to avoid is checking symmetry so how we start with checking symmetry is really just just with this checking almost an evenness and oddness sort of idea take your theta and plug in negative theta just see what happens so i'm going to replace my theta with negative theta if this works out to be exactly the same equation i started with we will have symmetry about the x-axis or the polar axis if not then we probably won't now get this we probably won't this is not a guarantee if it doesn't work it's not guaranteeing that you don't have symmetry but you just can't use it because you're not sure it's inconclusive if it does work we guarantee that we will have symmetry though so that's nice now i hope you remember about sine sine is an odd function so sine of negative theta equals negative sine of theta which one's the even function cosine is so if we had cosine of negative theta it would give us positive cosine of positive theta so for us we go okay 1 minus sine of negative theta sine of negative theta is negative sine theta it's going to change that sign so we take a look at it we've simplified it is this exactly the same equation that i started with no so this is probably not symmetric about the polar axis think x-axis probably not symmetric about the polar or x-axis so then we move on we deal with all three symmetries to make our lives as easy as humanly possible so how about pi minus theta you're gonna have to use some identities here we're gonna see that right now so i'm going to take r and leave our alone 1 minus sine this says replace replace your theta with pi minus theta and see what happens remember if we simplify this and get exactly what we started with we will for sure have symmetry about pi over 2 axis or the y axis so let's let's deal with that how in the world you simplify that when you don't know your theta this is where all those sum and difference formulas i taught you come into play so sine of pi minus theta we would think all right let's see sine of pi minus theta maybe have the formula sheet out is sine of the first one cosine of the second one minus cosine the first one sine of the second one but please remember that this is all in parentheses because this gives us this so this is 1 minus all of that stuff so uh sine of pi oh my gosh sine of pi is the y coordinate at pi that's going to be zero so this whole thing is gone pi of zero is zero sorry sine of pi is zero zero times cosine i don't care is zero minus cosine pi is negative one sine of theta is sine of theta so minus negative 1 sine theta now there's a lot of negatives going on but this says opposite of negative 1 is positive 1 1 minus positive 1 sine theta is 1 minus sine theta that's exactly what we started with which means that if this works you are going to have symmetry about that vertical axis the pi over 2 or the y axis okay last one to check take r and make it negative if positive r equals negative r when you change the sign of r um and it does and you get the exact exactly the same things you started with you'll have symmetry about the origin or the pole so let's do that all that's required is we take this r and change its sign now let's solve for r so divide everything by negative one now this is clearly not what we started with the signs are all opposite which means we probably don't have symmetry about the pole so after we've done that we don't really have any better way to go about it than plotting some points so why do we use symmetry in the first place so you wouldn't have to plot all of the points so you wouldn't have to plot pi over six pi equals zero pi over six pi over four pi over three pi over two uh two pi over three three pi over four 5 pi over 6 then pi and then all of this quadrant and then all of this quadrant you see here's what we learned while we don't probably don't have symmetry about our x-axis or the polar axis and we probably don't have symmetry about our pole we do have symmetry about the y-axis or about the pi over two axis so if we find all of these values we can mirror them and we'll have all of these values that's what the symmetry does so we really only need to find values from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. that's what we're going to do right now if we find this half we'll mirror it and find this f that's what that says you have symmetry about the y-axis so just find one side you could do this side for sure and mirror it here but these are generally easier so find the right side flip it and you'll get the left side because it's our only symmetry that's the only way we can limit the points that we have to plug in right now so we're going to take and plug in negative pi over 2 negative pi over 3 and all of these very common values and get those coordinates so we're about to get going on it remember that the polar coordinates are r comma theta so we're going to plug in these angles negative pi over 2 but they will be the second coordinate how we plug them in is no different we're going to take these values we're going to plug them into our equation we're going to see what happens so i'll do a couple with you and then i'll write down some of the other ones that i'm getting but here's the thought process if this is an angle and it's this angle right here then if i plug in that angle it will give me a distance from the pole so let's do that plug in negative pi over two sine of negative pi over two is negative one negative one so one minus negative one is two what that means is that along this angle of negative pi over two you're going to get an r of 2. can you plot that heck yeah so at negative pi over 2 you're going to get an ro2 that's going to give you this point we plotted lots of these things negative pi over 2 is your angle distance of 2 from the origin or the pole you're going to have a point right there that's our very first point so we're going to plot all of those how about negative pi over 3 sine of negative pi over 3 is negative square root 3 over 2. 1 minus negative square root 3 over 2 is like 1 plus square root 3 over 2. let's see um square root 3 over 2 is like 0.87 so this is positive 1.87 it's 1.866 something something but one thing right now please don't confuse positive values with negative y values this is r theta so what this says is go to an angle of negative pi over 3 got it then along that ray you're going out positive 1.87 so this is 2 1.87 be a little shorter probably right about here let's do negative pi over 4. sine of negative pi over 4 is let's see negative square root 2 over 2. 1 minus negative square root 2 over 2 is 1 plus square root 2 over 2 that's about 2.41 square no it's not point seven let's see square root of two is uh one point four one half of that is point four five point seven five ish so let's say positive 1.7 somehow i forgot negative pi over 6. so that's slightly closer to that pole let's plug in negative pi over six sine of negative pi over six is negative one-half so one minus negative one-half that's one plus one half that's three halves or one point five that's a little bit closer to that pole about zero remember we're plugging in angles here that would be an angle of zero that's on the polar axis so let's take zero let's plug it in sine of zero is zero one minus zero is one so at an angle of zero the distance from your pole is one that's what r theta is telling you now for positive angles with pi over six sine of pi over six is one half one minus one half is one half hopefully it's clear now we do not have symmetry across this this polar axis and that's because we're subtracting sine and sine is not symmetric about about that the sines of the y values are opposite so we don't have that symmetry let's try pi over four uh sine of pi over four if we're going to plug that in sine of pi over four square root 2 over 2 that's uh 0.707 1 minus that is like point now close to 0.3 but like 0.29 it's getting pretty close to that pole how about pi over three sine of pi pi over three is square root three over two that's point eight seven ish so one minus point eight seven is about point one three that's really close and then finally we're almost done pi over two sine of pi over two remember this is what we're doing plugging our angles into there to get our r that's our distance from the pole sine of pi over two is one one minus one one is zero so that says at an angle of pi over two you are at that pole so if we graph this don't graph with straight lines graph a nice smooth curve it's actually a really pretty graph so we have plotted all of those points by taking some some really common values negative pi over 2 negative pi over 3. all of these values from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 getting our r's from there and these all say at a certain angle this is how far away you are from the pole so we've shown that now we're going to apply a smooth curve but that's only half of it you see because we know about this symmetry we get to avoid plugging in all of these values which actually would take quite a long time um i did in my head i know but like this would take a little while so because we know symmetry just draw a mirror image you can draw all of these other values and actually put the points down uh most most of the time i wouldn't do that i would just kind of sketch it and make sure it's it's symmetrical that's about as good as i can do what that's called is called a cardioid so r equals 1 minus sine theta gives you something called a cardioid why because it kind of looks like a heart i hope it makes sense i hope that you're understanding the idea of that's real hard to look at as a rectangular equation it's not good so we're going to leave it in polar but that requires a few things from us it requires us to check symmetry to use symmetry if it does work and plug in some values that take advantage of that symmetry allows you to save work not make more work because otherwise you'd have to plug in all of these values around a unit circle it's very challenging we don't want to do that so identify symmetry limit what you have to plug in plug in known values on a unit circle make it easy on yourself to do the math and then mirror image those across the symmetry that you've identified okay let's try another one so we've got r equals 1 plus 2 cosine theta we're looking at this thinking rectangular equation nah not so much it's going to be really hard to do without that absolutely be pretty easy to do we have r squared equals 2 r cosine theta if we multiply both sides by r uh give us some sort of a circle not not too bad that not so much so we're going to check symmetry plug in some points and then graph it with our symmetry the first one we always check is almost an evenness idea plug in negative theta and see what happens now cosine's an even function so cosine of negative theta gives you cosine of positive theta so cosine negative theta cosine positive theta the same thing that means i can change my argument without changing my function so because cosine's even opposite inputs give you equal outputs this is still the same thing as 1 plus 2 cosine of positive theta due to the evenness of cosine now that's exactly what we got here what that says is that this function will be symmetric about the polar axis or about the x-axis we're going to try other symmetry we're going to try symmetry about the y axis or the pi over 2 axis so we're going to plug this this pi minus theta in use a sum or difference formula and then simplify so 1 plus 2 cosine pi minus theta we need the sum or difference formula for cosine the difference formula for cosine says cosine of the first cosine of the second plus sine of the first sine of the second but remember this 2 would be multiplied by all of this so let's take a look cosine of pi that's negative 1 so this would be negative cosine theta sine of pi is 0. so this whole thing disappears we get r equals one plus two remember this is negative one negative cosine theta if we simplify just a bit r equals one minus two cosine theta while that's close that is not exactly what we have here so this is probably not symmetric about that that pi over 2 or the y axis how about the negative r you know sometimes we can just look at it and think if that's negative these signs would both change that's not going to help me at all that's not going to be symmetric so this is not going to be symmetric about the the pole or the origin so dividing both sides by negative 1 that's not going to work so this is probably not symmetric about the pole after that we're just going to plug in some values but notice what happened because we know we're symmetric about this polar or the x-axis think x-axis we really only need to know these important values from 0 to pi and then we'll be able to mirror them so we're going to plug in 0 pi over 6 pi over 4 pi over 3 pi over 2 2 pi over 3 3 pi over 4 5 pi over 6 and pi you can get away with doing just some of these uh if you're careful so sometimes i i just omit doing pi over 4 and 3 pi over 4 because these values do enough for me so you can do that but to get the best picture possible plug in all the ones on the unit circle okay so let's get started remember what we're doing we're plugging in angles figuring out r from our function that's what it tells us that r in terms of theta says you can plug in theta and figure out r what that gives you is an ordered pair r comma theta says go along that angle that far whatever you figure out so let's plug in zero cosine of zero is one two times one is two two plus one is three this says go to an angle of zero and then go from the pole three units along the angle okay now we're going to plug in pi over six cosine of pi over six is square root three over two 2 times square root 3 over 2 is just square root 3. square root 3 is about 1.73 so 1 plus 1.73 is about 2.7 or 2.73 so this says along that angle go to the angle of pi over 6 and go out 2.7 units or thereabout pi over 4 cosine of pi over 4 right here is going to be square root 2 over 2. square root 2 over 2 times 2 is just square root 2. that's 1.4 1.41 1 plus 1.41 is like 2.41 so this says along that angle pi over 4 you're going to go out 2.4 pi over 3 cosine of pi over 3 is one half two times one half is one and one plus one gives you two so along this angle of pi over three we're gonna go up from the pole from the origin two units now we're gonna jump to pi over two so when we plug in pi over two cosine of pi over two that's zero two times zero is zero but one plus zero is one so along this angle of pi over two it says go to pi over two you're going to go up one unit along that ray from the pole now 2 pi over 3. so when we plug in 2 pi over 3 cosine of 2 pi over 3 is negative one half 2 times negative one half is negative one one minus one is zero so if i plug in two pi over three i'm gonna get zero there's where things get interesting so at two pi over three i get zero so along this ray two pi over three i'm gonna get right at the origin okay let's try 3 pi over 4. cosine of 3 pi over 4 is negative square root 2 over 2 times 2 that's going to give you negative square root of 2. it's negative 1.41 1 plus negative 1.41 is negative 0.41 we go how in the world we graph negative 0.41 remember these are polar coordinates says go to your angle 3 pi over 4 negative r would say go along this ray in the opposite direction of 0.4 how about 5 pi over 6 same thing is going to happen here cosine of 5 pi over 6 is negative square root 3 over 2. uh 2 times that is negative square root of 3 that's negative 1.7 1 plus negative 1.7 is negative 0.7 so we get negative 0.7 what that means is that we would go to 5 pi over 6 that's this ray right here negative r though says don't go along that rate go along the opposite one from it negative 0.7 in this case is along this part 0.7 units so we've done that last one let's plug in pi cosine of pi is negative one two times negative one is negative two one minus two is negative one so what this says polar coordinates go to pi all the way to here instead of going along the ray 1 go in the opposite direction that was right there now this is kind of weird because we we sort of cross over this axis of symmetry so be smart about it we're going to plot the curve first we're going to graph the curve first that we've got so it's a nice smooth curve but then we're going to use our symmetry our symmetry says remember we're symmetric about this axis but in both cases the stuff above goes below the stuff below goes above so we're just going to mirror image this thing i've done my best to mirror image that of course you could plug in the values but it can get a little confusing what this is called is a lemison with an inner loop so that's the inner loop that we have right there i'm hoping it makes sense we're going to try one more symmetry to make sure that you get it and then an example to wrap everything up let's keep right on going so we've got r equals 2 cosine 2 theta we might think about rectangular equations but that makes it pretty difficult because that would change into one of our double angle formulas and get a little bit hairy so we don't really want to do that instead let's take a look at our symmetry and we're going to find some very interesting things about this we'll start with plugging in negative theta and see what happens here so r would equal 2 cosine of negative 2 theta so negative theta would create negative 2 theta cosine's still even though so opposite inputs give you equal outputs that means we can change the sign of our argument without changing the sign of our function so cosine negative 2 theta is exactly the same thing as cosine of positive 2 theta and that means we're going to have symmetry about this polar axis or the x-axis if you want to think about that way now we're going to try plugging in pi minus theta use a difference um sum or difference formula and figure out what happens and we end up getting 2 cosine 2 pi minus 2 theta now before we get all crazy about now i got to use some sort of formula here generally you do like if we didn't have that too you probably would but i want you to notice something this is the same thing as negative 2 theta plus 2 pi what's the period of cosine though the period is 2 pi do you remember that you can add or subtract 2 pi from cosine or sine and get exactly the same value what that means is that 2 pi if i subtract that out of here it's going to give me exactly the same thing as cosine of negative 2 theta so let's subtract the 2 pi so whether you have two pi in there or subtract it out it's going to give you the same value such as let's see cosine of zero or cosine of zero plus two pi or cosine of zero plus four pi is going to be the same exact thing we can subtract 2 pi and b just fine now how about cosine of negative 2 theta again it's an even function so opposite inputs give you equal outputs this is the same as 2 cosine 2 theta but that's exactly what we started with which means not only do we have symmetry across the polar axis we also have symmetry across the pi over 2 axis or the y axis now let's say something that's got to make sense if you have symmetry across the x axis and you have symmetry across the y axis you will definitely have symmetry about the origin and the same thing happens here if you have symmetry about the polar axis and you have symmetry about the pi over 2 axis you are going to have symmetry about the the pole and you don't have to check it yes so what are we going to find well this is great if we have symmetry this way we only have to check this side of our unit circle but if we have symmetry this way we only have to check this side of our unit circle so really we just have to check the first quadrant that's it what are these here for well because we're going to get some negative r's and this is a little bit nice to use if you have negative r's you have these already so we're going to check just the first quadrant so we're going to plug in some angles we're going to figure out the r or the distance from the pole along those angles and we'll be able to plot this and then use all of our symmetry so let's plug in 0 2 times 0 zero cosine of zero is one two times one is two so what this says is that along the angle of zero you're going to go two units plug in pi over six uh 2 times pi over 6 is actually pi over 3. whoa that's going to be a little different we get the sum of these it's going to act like bigger angles that's where our negatives are going to come from so 2 times pi over 6 is pi over 3. cosine of pi over 3 is one-half two times one-half is one so along pi over six we would go out one unit let's go to pi over four two times pi over four well let's see that would be pi over two cosine of pi over two that's zero two times zero is zero this says go along pi over four but you're not going along it you're going zero from it so you are at the pole let's check out pi over three two times pi over three is two pi over three cosine of two pi over three is negative one half two times negative one half is negative one so this says go to your angle go to pi over three got it instead of going positive one in the direction of your angle go in the opposite direction of your angle so one unit in the opposite direction of your angle and now pi over 2. so cosine so 2 times pi over 2 is just pi cosine of pi is negative 1 and 2 times negative 1 is negative 2. so this says go to pi over 2 instead of going along the positive ray go along the opposite go down here to negative 2. so we're going to craft this but then we're going to use symmetry use all the symmetry that you have this is symmetric about the x-axis so what would that mean this would reflect here this would reflect here but you're also symmetric about the y-axis this reflects here this reflects here and this reflects here you get what's called a rose so this is what we call a rose in in polar equations so it's kind of nice using that symmetry you just make it all symmetrical these with the with itself across the y-axis and the x-axis or the pi over two axis and the polar axis and the pole and we would get a pretty nice shape out of that it's not perfect but did my best hopefully hopefully you're enjoying it and you're seeing the usefulness before we get to the last example i'm gonna i'd like for you to do it on your own the idea is check your symmetry first it limits what you actually have to plug in then plug in the least amount of points you possibly can usually it's two quadrants we got lucky here we got one quadrant um and then use your symmetry to mirror that that graph so we'll come back with one more example all right last one i gotta show you one that's symmetric throughout the pole i ruined it but you're gonna see why it is in just a second uh let's go ahead and do this we're gonna just not even worry about our rectangular equations uh from this because it'd be it'd be pretty crazy especially that 2 theta going on so let's check symmetry first thing we always check plug in negative theta evaluate that see if it's the same so if we're going to evaluate then r squared equals 4 sine of negative 2 theta and most of the time when you get used to this you can do them in your head just by the nature of what sine and cosine do so if you think i'm going to change the sign in an odd function it's going to change the sign of my function so this would be negative 4 sine 2 theta because sines odd opposite inputs give you opposite outputs change the sign of your argument change the sign of your function and what that means is this is probably not symmetric about the polar axis let's try the next one let's try um pi minus theta we're going to evaluate that and we get something very similar to the last example that we have 2 pi minus 2 theta sine's period is 2 pi means you can add 2 pi or subtract and just remove that entire thing and get the same result so we can subtract 2 pi from this from the argument and get the same exact output for sine which means we can eliminate that piece but if we do it actually brings us back to right here which we already know the result and that's clearly not what we started with so this is probably not symmetric about the pi over two axis either now what about negative r i regret it but if you evaluate negative r then negative r would be squared now it doesn't affect the right hand side at all but negative r squared is the same thing as r squared this is symmetric about the pole since we have symmetry about the pole we need to check two quadrants two consecutive quadrants doesn't really matter which ones you choose but if we check these two quadrants we can use symmetry to find these two quadrants if we check these two quadrants we use symmetry to find these two quadrants so you just need to check two of them i'm going to choose to check from zero to pi because those are easiest for me to plug in so let's go ahead and start start doing it remember these are polar coordinates you're plugging in angles and finding out distances from the pole and then we can plot those so an angle of zero if we evaluate that two times zero is zero sine of zero is zero four times zero is zero the square root that's a big deal the square root of zero is zero so this says at an angle of zero you are at the pole now let's plug in pi over six if we evaluate pi over six two times pi over six is pi over three sine of pi over three is square root three over 2 and 4 times that is 2 times square root 3 so 2 square root 3. let's see that's 1.7 times 2 about 2.8 but but notice something this would be r squared equals 2.8 how would you find r you take a square root but in doing so when you take a square root you have to do a plus and minus that is precisely why this is symmetric about the pole i need you to see it if you go to pi over 6 you can get plus or minus the square root of 2.8 i worked on the calculator i got about plus or minus 1.9 so here's what this says man get it get the relationship with symmetry about the pole this is go to your angle pi over six here's pi over six you're going to go out about 1.9 there's about 1.9 and negative 1.9 so here's pi over 6 positive 1.9 and negative 1.9 that right there is what is going to give you symmetry about that pole is because you have plus and minus because you go both positively and negatively could you have just found the positive and counted on symmetry to found the negative yes you totally could have done that as well let's try pi over 4. uh 2 times pi over 4 is pi over 2 sine of pi over 2 is 1. let's see if 1 times 4 is 4 r squared would equal 4 r equals plus or minus 2 the square root of 4 plus or minus 2. so here at pi over 4 this is you're going to go out to along the ray and out to in the opposite direction of that ray so here's pi over 2 go out 2 units and negative two units that's causing the symmetry about the pole let's do pi over three so two times pi over three is two pi over three sine of two pi over three let's see sine of two pi over three is square root three over two four times square root three over two is two square root of three so r squared equals two square root three r therefore would be plus or minus the square root of that that's exactly what we got here by the way so plus or minus 2 the square root of 2 square root of 3 is what we get that's again about plus or minus 1.9 so we do the same thing along pi over 3 here we go along pi over 3 go out 1.9 and in the opposite direction of pi over 3 go out 1.9 so negative 1.9 puts you in the on that ray in the opposite direction now how about pi over 2 if we evaluate pi over 2 2 times pi over 2 is pi sine of pi is 0. so 4 times 0 is 0 r squared is 0 square root of 0 is still 0. so we're going to get 0. now we already have zero that's okay let's try the next ones when you see something interesting happen try two pi over three when we evaluate two pi over three even though two pi over three is right here two times two pi over three is four pi over 3. now sine of 4 pi over 3 1 2 3 4 is negative please get this sine of 4 pi over 3 is negative square root 3 over 2. 4 times negative square root 3 over 2 is going to give you negative 2 square root 3. but look what you have if you have r squared equals negative 2 square root 3. so so again that's let's see four pi over three sine of four pi over three is negative square root of three over two four times that is negative two square root three if r squared equals negative two square root 3 take a square root what's going to happen you take a square root of this thing you're going to have a negative inside of a square root that's an imaginary number this can't happen here that's going to be imaginary here these are all imaginary because sine of those values 2 times let's see 2 times 3 pi over 4 that's going to give you 3 pi over 2. sine of 3 pi over 2 is negative square root r squared equal to negative square root of a negative is imaginary same thing 5 pi over 6 multiply by 2 that'd be 5 pi over 3. sine of 5 by 3 is negative r squared equals to a negative square root would give you imaginary number same thing with pi let's see 2 times pi would be 2 pi sine of 2 pi would give you 0 so i mean that gives you 0 but you have you already have 0 so no matter what you do with these you're going to get imaginary numbers these are non points for you which is why this graph is only going to exist in two quadrants one and three one because the values of sine are positive and square roots of positive make sense three because we know it's symmetric about the pole and we get those negative negative r for those angles 2 and 4 do not exist why because sine right there was was negative for those values and when you reflected them it doesn't make sense to reflect imaginary number does it make sense to plot an imaginary number on our polar coordinates so we just really have this graph it's called a lemnos gate so kind of interesting i hope that it makes sense i hope especially you understand that when you plug these in and it gives you a negative and r squared equals a negative the square root of a negative number is imaginary and we cannot plot that on our polar coordinate system the way we have it designed so i hope that this has made sense i really hope that you understand about the symmetry it's kind of fun it's you i think it's fine useful and it will allow you to graph some of these polar equations without translating too rectangular and having a very hard time doing it so find your symmetry limit the amount of points you plug in then use your symmetry hope it makes sense i hope you've enjoyed this video i hope you've enjoyed this series have a great day
