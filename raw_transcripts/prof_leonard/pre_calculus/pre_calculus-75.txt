Transcript for: Converting Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds (Precalculus - Trigonometry 2)
welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about these things called degrees minutes and seconds we go what in the world does that mean well it's a it's a way that we can measure smaller than one degree you see one degree is one 360th of a rotation or there are 360 degrees and one roll full rotation from an initial side to a terminal side that stops where it starts or terminates where it begins so if we want to get more specific than a degree we need something to do that so we need minutes and to get more specific than minutes we need seconds or we can use decimals you go why don't we just use decimals oftentimes we do but minutes and seconds are also very common and so i want to show you how to convert between the minutes and seconds fractions of a degree and decimal portions of that of that same degree so i'm going to show you that what they mean and basically that's what i've just explained to you so minutes and seconds are fractions of one degree if one revolution is 360 degrees well then parts of that degree can be broken up where one degree is equal to 60 minutes we make a minute like this looks almost like a foot notation if you're familiar with inches of feet and then one minute has 60 seconds now appreciate how small that is so one degree is already fairly small break that into 60 parts you're really really small break that really small thing into 60 seconds 60 other parts that are equal that that's exceptionally small so degrees minutes and seconds give you the ability to measure very very small units sometimes we can talk about minutes of angle if you've ever studied trajectory minutes of angle is what they're talking about here this is a minute of angle and we would talk about angles being in minutes so that you can be very specific with it hardly anybody would say seconds of angle that is exceptionally small so minutes and and seconds can give you very very accurate determinations of whatever angle you're talking about and so we're going to go ahead very very quick video here to show you how to change between minutes and seconds of a degree into decimals of degree and then we're going to go backwards from that in just a little bit so let's take a look at this if one degree equals 60 minutes and 60 minutes there's a one minute equals 60 seconds then we can think about a little different way too so that we can translate into degrees one minute is equal to one sixtieth of a degree just divide both sides by 60 and you will get 160 to the degree equals one minute or one second equals one sixtieth of a minute we'll take both sides divided by sixty you'd get one sixtieth of a minute equals one second but wait a second if literally if if one second is one sixtieth of a minute and one minute is one sixtieth of a degree then one second is one sixtieth of which means multiply 1 60 of a degree it's 1 60 of a degree squared that's one over 3600 of a degree that's very very small unit of measurement and so this is the way that we're going to convert this i'm going to show you that with just a couple examples obviously we don't need to convert degrees to degrees so leave the 61. we're just going to add some decimals to it and here's how if we take our minutes and we understand that if one minute is 1 60 of a degree then 42 minutes is 42 times that 1 60 of a degree so we can do that this right here notice the unit change this is 42 times one minute this is 42 times one minute this is one minute so just multiply your minutes by one sixtieth and put that degree there because you've just changed units you've just converted now how about the seconds 21 seconds means 21 times 1 60 of a minute or 1 60 of 1 60 of a degree so we can multiply that way so 21 seconds is 21 times well i'm not just going to do 21 times 160th of a minute because i'd have to convert twice so i want to do 21 is 160th 1 60 of a degree remember we're trying to convert two degrees here so it doesn't do me a lot of good to leave this in degrees and do this in degrees and then do this in minutes that doesn't make sense because i have to redo this and either add up my minutes and do it again or i'd have to convert twice and so let's make sure that all our units are correct so degrees that's that's great degrees are degrees minutes i've multiplied by 1 60 of a degree because one minute is 160 of a degree seconds i've multiplied by 1 60 of 160 of a degree because 1 second is 1 60 of a minute and that minute is 1 60 of a degree so we have a double conversion here this is what you're going to add up so i don't really care whether you add it this way and add this 61 plus whatever you get here plus whatever you get here or if you want to write out a little bit differently and say this becomes this is kind of the way i prefer because a little bit straighter here 61 degrees plus this portion as a degree i can easily see that those are both in the correct units plus this portion as a degree and now i have my degrees of degrees that's cool my minutes are degrees that's great my seconds are now in degrees can you see how we're just multiplying by 1 over 60 twice two times to get this into minutes and then this into degrees just like we had to multiply this to get into degrees and i like this because you can put it in your calculator just like it says and if you do that you're going to get that this is 61.2 but now it's in degrees that's how we change from this minute and second notation of fractions of a degree into a decimal version of that which one's better it really depends but notice something that this is let's see tenths hundred thousand ten thousand hundred thousandths of a degree this might be better notation sometimes because there are no decimals here you know exactly what to the second you're ending at um but that's how very very specific and accurate these minutes and seconds are they're exceptionally small measurements of of what that angle is doing so they are valuable don't throw these out just because maybe we prefer some decimals uh they work very well now some of the the uh the adding and subtracting are a little bit different because well we don't have a we don't have a base 10 we have a base 60 really 60 seconds is one minute 60 minutes is one degree and so that that can be a little rougher but as far as accuracy that's very accurate also notice one other thing if you ever get more than what that degree is you've done it wrong if these are ever more than 60 you can simplify that also so if you do your conversion you go i now have 89 degrees you go you probably mess that up a little bit because that is 61 and then a fraction of one little degree there and that's what that's saying to you so i hope that makes sense hope you understand where this comes from how i've explained from here to here hopefully pretty well for you and now i want you to practice one so me personally i would go straight from here to here understanding that three minutes is three times one over 60 degrees and 51 seconds is 51 times 1 over 60 times 1 over 60 degrees go ahead and try that now and see what you come up with okay hopefully you've taken the time to go ahead and try this on your own if we're going to convert from degrees minutes and seconds into decimals of a degree we're not converting away from degrees we're not getting something called radians which we're going to talk about in the next video very interesting exceptionally useful and that's what most of our calculus and working angles deals with honestly is is in terms of radians because the formulas work a lot better for a lot of formulas we deal with some are not even really possible very well in degrees so when we have this 101 degrees and then 3 minutes and 51 seconds 101 degrees is going to appear in your final answer so why because the rest of these are fractions or decimal of one degree it will never get you above that degree that's listed here if these are less than 60 each if they're more than 60 it should be translated first anyway it's a little bit nicer to work that way so we say okay well if these are fractions of a degree i can add those portions of the degree and the way we do that is we say that our three minutes is one sixtieth of a degree so if we multiply that we're going to get a decimal for this little part and 51 seconds is one 60 of a minute which is 1 60 of 1 60 of a degree so we multiply twice and we should end up with exactly that now i have a mistake on the board you should see it please please recognize that we are still in degrees and you need to show it so 101 degrees 3 minutes 51 seconds is 101.0641667 degrees i hope it makes sense i hope you're able to get it what we're going to do now is we're going to go backwards i'm going to give you a decimal in a degree i'm going to show you how to translate to minutes and seconds and then we're going to be done with our video all right let's go backwards let's go from a degree measurement of an angle into minutes and seconds i i think this is a little bit easier because you're multiplying by 60 instead of 160 we're going to see that bear out just a bit one thing i do want to mention though is that we should still be able to determine the quadrant in which our angles reside in which they terminate so we should still be able to think about this as hey 18 degrees that doesn't make it to 90 yet that should be in quadrant one and 29 degrees should be in quadrant one the previous examples that 61 degrees and whatever minutes and seconds that 61 degrees is still in quadrant 1 but that 101 degrees that we we converted a little while ago would have been in quadrant two that's past 90 but not to 180. so even though it has minutes and seconds we can still identify the quadrant usually you just look at the degree the minutes and seconds are parts of one degree and so you can determine what quadrant that terminal terminating side or terminal side lies in all right let's get back to it so if we have 18.255 degrees how can we translate that into minutes and seconds well by realizing that that .255 is just a fraction of one degree and so we can write it this way we can say 18.255 degrees is 18 degrees plus 0.255 degrees wait a second one degree is one is 60 minutes and so how this really works out you can think of this as this is 0.255 times 1 degree it's true statement 0.255 times 1 degree is 0.255 degrees but that degree is 60 minutes that one degree is 60 minutes so if i take my 0.255 and multiply by 60 minutes which is the same thing as one degree it's going to give me the number of minutes i have and then a decimal in this case it's 15.3 so this right here if i take my .255 times 60 minutes this is 18 degrees plus 15.3 minutes stick with me i hope that's it making sense i hope that 18 says yes it's my degree no problem this is a fraction of a degree fractions of degree can be translated into a different type of fraction of degree minutes and seconds let's multiply by the 60 minutes that are in our degree so i have 15.3 minutes but wait the 0.3 well this would be 15 full minutes and 0.3 of another minute we can do the same thing as we can here so i'm going to take this down and say this is 18 degrees 15 full minutes and 0.3 of another minute but that minute has 60 seconds in it so we're going to do the same thing as we did here we can say 0.3 minutes is 0.3 times 1 minute that's a true statement but 1 minute is 60 seconds we see right here 1 minute 60 seconds and so because point three minutes is point three times one minute and that one minute has 60 seconds in it we can take that point three and we can multiply it by 60 seconds and get that trans translation or that transformation um into into seconds so 18 degrees plus 15 minutes plus 0.3 times 60 seconds 60 seconds in a minute is 18. that would be 18 seconds and so we can put this all together we can say this is 18 degrees 15 minutes and 18 seconds now which way's better it really depends on the context they mean the same thing this right here is a very very accurate and people understand what that is decimal sometimes we can't wrap our head around really how accurate that's getting sometimes the reverse is true sometimes we really want a decimal version of that that degree so i hope it makes sense on where it's coming from that's the big part understand that 18 degrees is the whole degree and that's a fraction of it so multiplying by 60 will give you a number of minutes multiplying whatever decimal you have by 60 again will give you the number of seconds now this is very convenient for us because .3 times 60 was a whole number if it's not then you're going to round we're going to see that in the next example i want you to try it right now i want you to break it down you don't necessarily have to show all of this stuff what i'd rather you understand is that taking a decimal of a degree is less than one degree and therefore you can multiply by 60 minutes for that degree and get the number of minutes 60 seconds for that the decimal of the minute you get the number of seconds go ahead and try that now see if you can do it all right so we're going to give it a try the first thing we're going to do is we're going to understand that 0.411 is less than 1 degree it's a fraction of 1 degree and it's equal to because 1 degree is 60 minutes it's equal to 0.411 times 60 minutes so we're going to show that so 0.411 times 60 minutes well that is 24.66 so what that means is if there's 60 minutes in one degree and we have point four one one of one degree then that's going to be 24 minutes now 24.66 minutes well that's all well and good but if we're trying to get away from the decimals and into minutes and seconds this says you have 24 full minutes but .66 of the next minute and that next minute has 60 seconds in it so we're going to break that up or say this is 24 minutes plus 0.66 of the next minute notice how it's not just 66 seconds notice how 66 seconds would be very inappropriate to write you can't get above that otherwise you start counting minutes remember that if you were to actually count on a clock here once you get to 60 seconds you you don't really go 6162 you go oh that's one minute and one sec or yeah one minute and one second or one minute and two seconds you start counting the next next place value over and in this case since we're base 60 you're counting up minutes every time you get to 60 seconds so that can't be right what that means is that's a fraction of one minute but wait a minute one minute contains 60 seconds let's multiply if that's 0.66 of one minute and one minute has 60 seconds and 0.66 times 60 seconds gives us 39.6 39.6 seconds typically we're going to round this so in this case that is more accurate than what we're going to get because we're going to round this to 40 seconds and when we put that all together notice how we're still 29 whole degrees and a fraction of that next degree but written in terms of minutes and seconds and not just a decimal that's about it that's how we can translate from our minutes and seconds into a decimal version of degree or in from degrees and with decimals into minutes and seconds i've explained both of them hopefully pretty well for you hopefully you understand how they're they're used uh sometimes people get really kind of confused with um minutes and seconds because they don't know where they come from and now that you do hopefully it makes more sense to you so we're done with this now it's about as far as we need to go it's just that understanding and next time we're going to explore something different so we've explored how one full rotation sweeping out a full rotation with an angle is 360 degrees we're going to talk after we because we talked about minutes and seconds already we're going to talk about how we can measure that a different way we can measure with some angles with something called radians and it's a completely different thought on where that angle comes from so i'll see you for that video that's a really important one don't skip it and come prepared to really really focus on it alright have a great day
