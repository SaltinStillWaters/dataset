Transcript for: Graphing Transformations with Tangent and Cotangent (Precalculus - Trigonometry 14)
hey welcome to another video so in this video what we're going to talk about are how to transform some of the graphs we just learned about how to transform tangent and cotangent in terms of a vertical shift maybe a vertical stretch of compression and then altering the period which is a horizontal stretch or compression depending on how we alter that that period so we're taking a look at that it's very very similar to sine and cosine and how we approach this idea so we're going to approach this with let's discover what causes a vertical shift let's talk about how we would put our period on the graph then we'll talk about how to adjust maybe a vertical stretch with key points where our vertical asymptotes come in for tangent and cotangent and then where our key points are after we start manipulating so that's our idea let's get right into it so with tangent and cotangent the reciprocal function for tangent there's a few things we need to really know the first one is that with the form that's quite similar to the graphs of sine and cosine we have some key features that i really really need you to know number one anything that's added after the function so after tangent and then you get the parentheses or cotangent that's going to be a vertical shift so this b is a vertical shift where plus is up and minus is down and that should make sense we've seen that for a long time that that affects the output so you plug in some stuff it does whole bunch of junk and then you add to it or subtract from whatever the output is it's going to move the entire graph up or down depending whether it's added or subtracted respectively and it's important we're going to discuss that as we go through some of these examples the second thing and probably the most important part here is to get the period right for tangent and cotangent you see tangent and cotangent both have a period of pi not two pi and we talked about why that was we talked about because due to the signs in the first and second quadrant and the third and fourth quadrant we have the sine interplay we have sort of a repeat of tangent every pi and so what's going to happen for us is that tangent and cotangent have a period of pi and so we're not going to put t equals 2 pi over omega we're going to put 2 this just as pi over omega because that's how often tangent and cotangent cycle that's how often they repeat that's what their period is now there is something very important here to understand tan while both tangent and cotangent have a period of pi where it's located on the graph is different it's actually a phase shift over and then a reciprocal of the function so here's what i need you to know with tangent the period centers on zero so you'll have half a period to the right and half a period to the left of zero of the y-axis and so it should always be symmetric if we don't have a phase shift if we aren't shifting left or right we should always have a period for tangent that's symmetric about that y the period not the function just the period is symmetric about that cotangent is different cotangent is very similar to sine and cosine and then it starts at 0 and then goes to pi and then from pi to 2 pi so tangent actually takes a little bit more work to do we're going to see that our very first example so that's really important we didn't know b is this vertical shift idea we need to know that the period is not based on 2 pi but on pi and we're dividing by whatever coefficient of x that is to adjust that tangent happens to have 0 right in the middle of that period cotangent starts at zero with a vertical asymptote or you can think of that way both of them have vertical asymptotes at the end of the period which is really nice we're going to use that and have an x-intercept in the center and then have negative one and one for tangent it's negative 1 and positive 1 at the first and third quarters and for cotangent it's positive 1 negative 1 at the first and third quarter so we're going to use that so here's the whole idea of what we're going to do we're first going to identify any vertical shift that we have if we have one we're then going to take a look at our period based on pi and cut it if we have to by whatever the coefficient of x is we're going to put that period on the graph so either on the x axis or on the shifted version of that or on both if we do have a vertical shift after that we're going to determine where our period is so our period says we're going to start in the middle with tangent with a zero and do half a period left and half a period right that's that's harder to do than most of them with cotangent we're gonna start at zero and just go a period to the right and then we're gonna say okay what happens at the center of that period you'll have an x-intercept for both of these with tangent you'll locate the first quarter and third quarter let's go negative one positive one with cotangent positive one negative one and that's about it we'll use our whatever our amplitude it's not really an amplitude whatever our a is to adjust our key points and that will give us a vertical stretch let's get right into it let's take a look at 3 tangent of x so the first thing we're going to identify is do we have any sort of a vertical shift vertical shifts have to happen at the end of your function so after your function happens if you add or subtract so we don't have one there's nothing being added or subtracted which means that our x-axis is where we're going to put our period the next thing we do is we talk about that period so our period for tangent is based on pi that's how often it cycles but we also know that we can adjust that period or give it a horizontal stretch or compression by dividing by whatever that number is now if that's one then our period is just pi so here's what i'm going to teach you with tangent it's very important to understand that the period of tangent is pi but it's centered around zero or centered around that y axis so if that's the center of the period well then how can we put a period of pi well we don't want to go all the way over to pi now think about that think about why that is if we went all the way to the right pi and all the way to the left pi that would be two periods it'd be two pi from the very far left to the very far right that's a problem so here's how i always approach doing the period of tangent i start at zero if we do not have a phase shift if we're not shifting left or right i start at zero and i take that whatever this is and i divide it by two that's going to give me the the interval to the right and then negative gives me the integral integral interval to the left so i'm going to take a look at that and go okay pi pi divided by 2 is pi over 2. that's going to be our right most end of our period if you will now what's nice about this is wherever we have that zero if we shift it then where we shift it acts like a zero that's fine wherever we have that that is the center of our period for tangent which means you have this sort of a symmetry as far as your period is concerned so if we're pi over 2 to the right and this is the center pi over 2 to the left has to be the left hand side of that particular period we just make it negative now so that we've determined we have no vertical shift we have this period of pi think about it from negative pi over two to positive pi over two you have to be thinking yes so that is a period of pi there's half a pi to here half a pi there we all know one half of pi plus another half pi that full pie it's delicious so that's that's our that's our period for this now what happens next use some of the key features that we understand about tangent understanding that at the ends of your period you're going to have a vertical asymptote so we're going to put that up there we're going to put vertical asymptote at the ends of our periods right here at negative pi over 2 and right here at pi over 2 we're also going to put an x-intercept right at the center in this case right at the origin so we've done that we have our vertical asymptotes at the ends of our period we have the x-intercept at the center of our period that's great but we also have some important features at the quarters of our period so what we're going to do is take this which is nice that it has zero and figure out what this is so typically what happens is you need to go halfway between zero and that if it's zero that's very convenient if it's not zero you might have to do a little math there but figure out in this case it's just pi over four how you can always do it is add these up and divide by two that will average them or find the middle find the mean of that and so that's going to be pi over four and of course the same thing native power four symmetry's great force on the period so some important things are going to happen uh with tangent at the quarters and this is what i what i always do i always do the vertical shift i always find my period second i always write it out there make sure my my asymptotes are the ends my x-intercepts at the center i find my quarters first my first quarter second quarter is the middle and then the third quarter is is right before the end of that period this is what's going to give me my what i call key points so here's how key points work take your first quarter and your third quarter remember that tangent climbs cotangent falls tangent naturally climbs so you're gonna have a negative one and a positive one that's where we get our key points from so you'll notice in the last video i really didn't give you like the negative pi over four power four specifically i just said hey at the first quarter you're going to have negative one at the third quarter you're gonna have positive one now here's why we do that whatever our coefficient of our function is that number right there it's going to affect your key points so the whole thing that we go through with tangent and later cotangent is find your vertical shift put it on your graph find your period put it on your graph find the n's vertical asymptotes center x intercept quarters and create for yourself your original key points first quarter negative one third quarter positive one and then if you have anything being multiplied right here that is going to multiply those two key points it's going to do a vertical stretch or compression depending on whether that number is larger than one or smaller than one it can also reflect it if it's negative and so we check it check that out so for us because that's three we're going to multiply this by three not the input you can't change that period that would have happened here inside of some parentheses that's not the idea this is affecting the output look at why that would happen you plug in a number tangent does something and it says hey take the output output and multiply it by three output multiplied by three is going to stretch that out i had to adjust my graph a little bit but here we go so if we're going to put these now adjusted or stretched out key points negative pi over 4 comma negative 3 that's here and positive 4 positive pi over 4 comma positive 3. and so this is going to be a very skinny looking graph so this goes all the way from negative infinity to positive infinity on that y-axis but it's going to be stretched out so it's going to appear more horizontally narrow and that's a decent picture of what tangent looks like and what we'd say is the first period so negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. this has just been stretched out a little bit vertically and i hope that makes sense to you i hope you're seeing the idea hope i really hope you're seeing this similar similarity with sine and cosine that we've gone through the same steps now oftentimes you'll have to give yourself another cycle so take this and expand it now how we do that just take and add your period whatever you have here add it to the end or subtract it from the end of your period so pi over 2 plus pi well pi over 2 plus 2 pi over 2 that'd be 1 pi is 3 pi over 2. that's going to give us another end of a different period so another period of this is this plus pi is pi over 2 pi over 2 plus pi is 3 pi over 2. in the center of that is just pi now that should make sense the center here is zero zero plus pi is pi and gives me another center of a different period and so we can again draw another vertical asymptote we can find our quarters we can put an x-intercept at the center of that period so i've gone ahead and i've done that i've put my vertical asymptote i've put my x-intercept at the center of that different period i've also taken and found my quarters three pi over four and five pi over four how do you how do you do that there's a couple ways you can number one you could average one pi and three pi over two you could do that if you want to you could also take your first period and just add pi so pi over four plus pi is five pi over four and negative power four plus pi is three pi over four um i do it with fractions i just take a listen and then i think about this like one-fourth so one-fourth plus one whole pie that'd be four fourths well that's five fourths or five pi over four same thing with this and now because we understand not just this key point idea but what this really represents yeah that says negative pi over four but what it really stands for is the first quarter of your period comma negative three okay so here's the first quarter of my period comma negative three and this stands for the set the third quarter of my period so first second third the third quarter of my period comma positive three so we just go ahead and put that again and we get hopefully i drew a little bit funny but we get the same exact look it's just going to repeat just like sine does just like cosine does it's just that here we have some vertical asymptotes that make us obey them so we have to be the same looking graph every single cycle and i hope that makes sense i hope that you understand the technique of graphing that i've given you i've built this off of the college algebra and even the intermediate algebra i teach it all the same exact way how you graph because it really doesn't have to change so that's what i would like you to do hopefully it makes sense on what we're talking about for the key points like hey that's first quarter i don't really care if it's negative pi over four it's the first quarter of whatever period it is if we understand that tangent's period centers on zero or where we shift that to or from that that's going to help us out a lot it's pi for tangent and then we adjust that and center it on 0. cotangent's a bit different we'll see that in a couple more examples right now let's go ahead and let's look at at this one it's going to have a vertical shift to it so now that we have y equals negative two tangent three x plus one maybe you can start identifying what's going to happen here we should we should be at that point we should understand that that plus one that's going to be a vertical shift up one we should understand that that three is going to start cutting the period what's it mean that means it's going to make it horizontally compressed that 3 takes that number and divides it that's what's going to happen it's going to be pi over 3. centered at 0 means pi over 6 and negative pi over 6 we'll get to that in a second but that's going to shorten this period what that means is going to vertically compress oh sorry horizontally compress this graph what's that negative 2 do that negative 2 is going to reflect this and vertically stretch it so there's four transformations here up one horizontally compressed vertically stretched and then reflected i hope you're seeing that let's go ahead and let's do it now so the first thing that we deal with with pretty much any sort of our transformations is a vertical shift since that says plus one this is a vertical shift up one we're going to do that the other thing that we're going to do is take a look at our period tangent and cotangent are the only two trig functions that have a period of just pi and not 2 pi and so we're going to take a look at that and go okay if our period is just pi we're going to take and divide whatever that pi is whatever the period is by whatever that number is that's 3. so what this does is take your period and make it smaller that squishes your graph that's called a horizontal compression so here's what this means our period is now pi over 3. what's pi over 3 do pi over 3 is is the period of tangent in this this particular function but it's centered at zero so this goes back to exactly what i was talking about here we are about to put our period on the graph but remember tangent centers at zero so what do we do we said if this period centers a zero there's gonna be pi over two half of this to the right and negative pi over two half of this to the left let's do the same thing let's say this is pi over three half of it's going to be to the right of zero let's see pi over 3 divided by 2 is pi over 6. how do we do that if you want to ever divide a number by 2 you can multiply the denominator by 2 and do the same thing so pi over 3 divided by 2 is the same thing as pi over 3 times 2 that's pi over 6. so this period is going to go from negative pi over 6 to 0 to positive pi over 6 that's going to be that interval that's going to make sense it's going to make sense that pi over 3 being split right down the middle right at 0 is going to be negative pi over 3 being split down the middle is going to be negative pi over 6 to positive pi over 6. let's put that i'm going to put it in two places and you can you can actually do it right now you can always find distance between two numbers by by subtracting them so pi over six minus negative pi over six let's see minus negative is adding that's two pi over six or pi over three this has a period of pi over three just like we want it's centered at zero just like we said it does tangent has zero at the center of that period and that's exactly what we have we have not shifted this left to right this is not does not have a phase shift is what that's called so that's great you'll also notice that i put the period on my x-axis and where i shifted this so this is going to act like our x-axis as far as our key points are our as far as our key points are regarded this is going to act like that we're going to do everything from there even though it's not really there it ships the whole graph up it's a nice graphic organizer to say this is where all of our stuff is really so we've done that and now we've got to find the quarter of our period so i've done find the shipped up we got it find the period we have it center it at zero for tangent no problem half to the right half to the left we got that pi over three divided by two is five over six and now we find the quarters so the quarters of the period say find out what this distance is and divide it by two you can always do that by averaging that if you want to so pi over six plus zero is pi over six divided by two is pi over 12. now we're going to take care of the key features that tangent has at the ends of the period because you've already identified i've talked about that we're going to put a vertical asymptote at the center of the period we're going to put an x-intercept but please keep in mind that x-intercept is based on where this is shifted to so that's why we put that that horizontal dot line is say hey this thing's acting like our x-intercept we're gonna put our x-intercept there yeah i know it's not on the x-axis but because we shifted it that x-intercept even though it's not one really gets shifted with it so now we've got our vertical asymptotes at the ends of our period we know that tangent has an x-intercept at the center but because we shifted it this acts like our x-intercept we think x-axis right here even though i know it's not really there but it helps us out a great graphic organizer now that we've done that now that we've identified the period we put it on this vertically shifted graph up one unit we have our asymptotes at the ends we have our x-intercept of the center we now deal with our key points so remember tangent has first quarter negative one third quarter positive one all we have to do is know the quarters we've already done that that's exactly what that tells you so because our first quarter of our period is negative pi over 12 and our third quarter is positive pi over 12 these are our let's call them original key points okay what happens to them they get manipulated they can change because we have that negative 2. that negative 2 is a factor factors multiply stuff what do they multiply they multiply the outputs and so if we have our first quarter and third quarter we know that tangent normally does first quarter one and third sorry first quarter negative one and third quarter positive one now we're going to stretch these and reflect it that negative two does both of those jobs for us so we multiply the output by that and that gives us our new key points i know there's a lot going on here i'm not really taking it easy on some of these graphs and making sure that we really understand all about it and trig functions can be a bit more difficult because we're not as familiar with them but i really hope that you're seeing this is the same exact process i've been teaching for a long time it's deal with your vertical shift show it recognize what type of a function it is and show some key features of it like hey vertical asymptotes happen at the ends of period x-intercept in the center understand the key points about it first quarter negative one third quarter positive one and understand what this does that factor multiplies outputs so now we have hey this is going to be at the first quarter i don't care if it's negative pi over 12 i care that that's the first quarter mark of my period it's gonna be first quarter positive two all right it's it's based on where we shifted to though isn't it because we shifted that up it's based on that this is kind of like our baseline our benchmark right here that's where we're at our key points are in relation to that so we treat this like a new axis it's not really there we get it we understand the idea behind it so first quarter comma positive two third quarter common negative two and if we do that we have first quarter positive two third quarter negative two so when we show these shifts up and down or left and right with the phase shift we base our key points on on that new sort of x and y axis yeah it's not really there it's just a really convenient way to deal with it and so that's what we're going to do so the true points are negative pi over 2 comma 3 and positive pi over 2 pi over 12 sorry comma negative 1. those are the real points we're just using this to get a good graph and it's very effective so now we're going to graph it and that behaves exactly how we thought it would shift it up shortened this way and then reflected and stretched and that's exactly the graph that we get if you had to do another cycle then we're going to add whatever this period is to it remember we're not adding pi right now we're adding whatever this period is this is the period of this particular function it was based on pi but we divided it by 3. so we take pi over 6 and we would add pi over 3. let's see pi over 6 plus pi over 3 pi over 6 plus pi over 3 that's like 2 pi over 6 that'd be 3 pi over 6 that's me pi over 2. i hope that makes sense i hope that you're seeing that and that you also understand that zero plus whatever that is is gonna be pi over three so zero plus pi over three that should give you another center of your period and that's exactly what that does so we draw a vertical asymptote we add pi to all of these quarters and we get exactly the same look i'm going to show you right now but i'm going to not go through it very slowly i'm going to just kind of show you the graph honestly hardest part for students is usually dealing with these fractions how i do it i just start adding whatever that is so negative pi over 12 plus pi over 3 that's that's 3 pi over 12 or pi over 4 and then 1 pi over 12 plus pi over 3 that's going to be 5 pi over 12 use your calculator use your fraction on your calculator usually works pretty well now what's important about it well it's important to understand that stands for now your first quarter and third quarter we already know that we know that this is first quarter two so first quarter from here from where we shifted this first quarter positive two third quarter negative two from here that's one two and we should get just a repeat of that same graph i hope it's making sense i'm hoping i'm explaining it to you in a way that you understand i'm really hoping that you understand that these key points come from your quarters for tangent and for cotangent they're first quarter and your third chord and we manipulate them by multiplying that number for your output also base it on where you shifted to that's important that's why we do this in certain order we do our vertical first then we put our period then we find the center and the quarters those quarters give you key points that's at least for tangent cotangent the final thing is to reiterate that tangent is centered around zero unless you have a phase shift if you do you set it around where you shift it to but it does center at zero so take whatever this is divide by two and go positive and negative um what we're going to do now is come back and look at cotangent just a couple examples there and then we're going to be done all right let's get after it so we have cotangent three cotangent one half x minus two we're going to go very quickly through these the only differences between this and tangent is that it's going to be it looks looks like a reflective graph it's a reciprocal but it's going to be downward rather than upward climbing so it's going to be a completely decreasing graph the period is still pi but it starts at zero it's not centered at zero that makes it actually a little bit easier on a lot of a lot of things you're going to do other than that the because we have this downward this decreasing graph our key points are a little different our key points are not first quarter negative one it's first quarter positive one and third quarter negative one and so that's going to give it its decreasing look let's get right into it the first thing we do with our graphs is we find out whether we have a vertical shift or not that's exactly what that says we have a vertical shift of down two after we deal with that we talk about the period cotangent and tangent both have a period of pi how we adjust that how we stretch that or compress that is based on whatever that number is so we take that period we divide by whatever the coefficient of x is in this case we divide by one-half wait a minute dividing by one-half is effectively multiplying by two that's going to give us a period of 2 pi what that's done is stretch this graph out horizontally this is a horizontal stretch not a horizontal compression this is going to make this a little bit wider twice as wide and we're going to go ahead and put that on our graph so we're going to go from 0 to 2 pi remember while tangent centered at 0 cotangent does not tangent we would have done that so we said okay pi to the right pi to the left cotangent starts at zero and just goes whatever that period is very much like sine and cosine it's a little bit easier so we've gone ahead and said hey if cotangent has a period of in this case two pi for this particular function then that has to start at zero so zero plus two pi is two pi this is the start and the end of the first period if we had to do another cycle which i'm not going to show you you'd go now to four pi you'd add another two pi very similar sine and cosine so we found the ends of our period zero and two pi cotangent starts at zero the center is pi and now we'll find the quarters so we have now our ends of our periods of zero and two pi we got the center at pi and we have our quarters at pi over two and three pi over two and we're going to put the important features on there our vertical asymptotes which i've shown you happen at the end so 0 and a 2 pi if we had gone another cycle it'd be at 4 pi our x-intercepts happen at the centers just like for tangent the only difference is is that well cotangent is the reciprocal cotangent starts at zero is not centered at zero and we do a negative one positive one reverse for our key points so our x-intercept is still the center of the period remember the center of the period is now at pi and we're going to put it where we shifted this now that we have our first and our third quarters that's what's going to give us our key points so it was really important for us to realize that with with our key points tangent is negative one and one cotangent is one and negative one at the quarters at the first quarter and the third quarter respectively so for us our first quarter is pi over two cotangent is going to put pi over 2 comma 1. that would be the original point on a graph with this particular period with cotangent now we are going to manipulate that we're going to affect that with a 3 it's going to be a multiplier for us but that's how we start so we have went down one we found our period of two pi it's not centered at zero it starts at zero we found the center and our first and third quarters we know that our x-intercepts are the center but it's where we shifted this to this acts like your x-axis our key points are the first quarter but this is our first quarter and our third quarter this is our third quarter and it's going to be negative one and positive one reversed from tangent so basically first quarter positive one and third quarter negative one that's what we have here now what happens is that that number right there that factor affects your outputs we're going to allow that to happen so there's no reflection here really there's only three transformations there was a down two there is a taking your horizontal taking your function horizontally stretching it taking your period and growing it and then vertically stretching this so we have our key points at first quarter one third quarter negative one that's exactly what cotangent says for us and we're going to stretch that by a factor of three literally a factor of three and since we've shown those those um those key points here are first and third quarter if we base it on where we shifted this acts like our x-axis this would be first quarter comma three so one two three and third quarter comma negative three right about there and you can see you can see that this is stretched out horizontally that's what that period is twice as big as a normal period for cotangent it's not centered at zero starts at zero and now we have our key points laid out first quarter comma positive 3 because we stretched it and third quarter comma negative 3 because we stretched it there's not a reflection there's only three transformations now we're going to graph it if you had to do another cycle then you would take and add another period to that so add 2 pi to it you get 4 pi in the center would be 3 pi and you find your quarters very easily on that and you get exactly the same look yeah i hope it's making sense i hope that you really seen the idea of basing everything on where you shifted it and the just the essential nature of finding your period first we really really really have to get that because if you have that and you understand where it starts all of them start at zero except for tangent which is centered at zero if you understand where it starts and where it stops you can find your center and your quarters and everything happens with those our key points are very valuable we just have to manipulate them if you have a coefficient out front so i hope it's making sense let's do one more all right if you want to try it on your own you really should we're going to get right into it we're going to take a look at this and first thing we're going to identify is what function we have and what's happening to it so let's see cotangent cotangent has a certain set of rules that we have to follow like a period of pi not centered at zero but starts at zero we're going to have vertical asymptotes at the end of the period x intercept of the center first quarter positive second quarter negative unless we reflect it or stretch it or something so we identify what function we have maybe have a picture of your head then we talk take a look at if we have a vertical shift this has a vertical shift of up one we're going to write that down and then we're going to show it then we take our period pi and divide by whatever that coefficient is now if it's a little awkward like pi over four it actually becomes a little easier um this is this is going to cancel your pies out so pi divided by pi over four how many times is pi over four fit into pi four times the pi's cancel you basically get one divided by one fourth which is four your period here is four so that's a little bit larger not a lot larger but a little bit larger than the normal period of pi so this is a horizontal stretch just a little bit remember pi is 3.14 and ish and so if this is is a little bit bigger than that so 4 is bigger than 3.14 it's a it's a slight horizontal stretch it's important to know that it's not a compression it's a horizontal stretch it'll make the graph a little wider so we said up one we got it we took our period tangent and and cotangent have the same period it's pi it's just centered differently and we divide by that number we get four we're going to put that on our graph right now so with a period of four remember cotangent starts at zero it's not centered cotangent's period starts at zero zero plus four is four the center is 2 the quarters are 1 and 3. that's kind of nice kind of nice when you have a pi in there it makes it easier then what we're going to do is we're going to put our key features vertical asymptotes at the end x-intercept in the center of course the x-intercept goes where we shifted this to this acts like your x-axis for all of our key points for all of our x-intercepts so vertical asymptotes great at the at the at the start and the stop of our period we're going to put our x-intercept at the center but we shifted that so that acts like your x-intercept because it acts like your x-axis yes the point is not two comma zero it's two comma one because you shifted up one that's okay it's just to get the graph now that we have that we deal with our key points our key points are always given by the quarters for tangent and cotangent which is why we want to do our period first because it's nice to fill that out you do the ends do the center do your quarters then those quarters act as your key points so for cotangent we have first quarter positive one and third quarter negative one that's exactly what we have here first quarter is one common positive one third quarter is three comma negative one we're just going to affect it by whatever this number is in this case negative one that factor multiplies your outputs just your outputs though so 1 comma negative 1 sure three comma negative one so this has taken the first quarter comma positive one and reflected it so first quarter positive one would have been here we reflect it now we're down here remember it's all based on where you shifted to this acts like your x axis so first quarter negative one third quarter positive one and these are the three transformations that we have we had a vertical shift up one no problem we have this slight horizontal stretch it's going to make it a little wider and we have this reflection so it's going to end up looking a lot like tangent but the period is not centered at zero it starts at zero if you had to draw another cycle what would you do well you'd take that and add it again you'd have eight in the middle would be six you'd have five and seven as your quarters you'd have the same exact key points for your first and third quarters and you graph the same thing again and again and again and that would repeat every 4 as a matter of fact because that here for this particular function is your period i hope it's making sense i hope that you're really seeing that the necessity of identifying the function and getting the key features so all we're going to do with this stuff is identify any vertical shift no problem take care of the period for sine and cosine secant and cosecant the periods two pi for tangent and cotangent periods pi be very careful with tangent the period centers at zero all the rest of them start at zero tangents kind of the oddball there so take your period and go to the right and left of zero by half for tangent cotangent's easier just add it to zero and then then we find out the center then we find out the quarters for tangent and cotangent make sure you have the vertical asymptotes of n x-intercept at the center based on where we shift to acting like your new x-axis our key points happen at the quarters we adjust them by maybe having to multiply but if we base it all on treating this like an x axis here that shifted version we get very nice graphs for very little work for the last time i hope that you understand that yes the point is not really three comma one it's three comma two because of that shift this just acts like your x-intercept to give you a great picture i really hope it's making sense i hope you enjoyed the technique actually um i've seen it work very well for a lot of students because it it tends to click and they go oh yeah that makes sense i'm just following my process it's not magic it's just finding out my period my center my quarters and using the features of these graphs that you understand hope makes sense we're going to come back with the graphs of secant and cosecant next time have a great day you
