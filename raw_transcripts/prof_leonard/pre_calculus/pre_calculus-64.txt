Transcript for: Solving Exponential Equations with Logarithms (Precalculus - College Algebra 64)
hey there welcome to another video in this video we're going to solve some exponentials so I'm going to show you four different ways to do that with a basic in exponential and one way to do that with some more advanced exponentials so we're going to talk about what in the world it means to use a logarithm to solve an exponential without common bases we'll discuss common bases a little bit but I'm not going to go into this video since we've already done that and then I'll show you some substitution techniques to deal with some exponentials that don't look exactly doable so let's get right into it when we say that we're going to solve an exponential equation with a logarithm what we're doing is we're implying that on this exponential equation we can't do this special case of finding common bases see we've done that several times where we had this exponential equation we said oh hey look magic happened and we have these common bases and once we find the same base on both sides of our equation we can set our exponents equal to one another we've done that already this is the case where what happens if you have an exponential equation there's no way to find a common base like three and five there's no way to change a five into a three or three and five into some lower base to set our exponents equal so here's the idea in solving any equation you need the inverse operation or inverse function because exponentials have an inverse and it's called a logarithm it's going to take a logarithm to solve these exponentials there are a few ways like four ways that I can show you how to do this that are all equivalent what that means is that your solution might look a little bit different than like a textbook or someone else's considering the choice you make on how to solve this uh when we get to not having just one exponential when we have two exponentials that really pairs down what we can do and leads us into um well you have to take a logarithm on both sides and we're going to see that so we're going to jump right into it here's the idea on how you solve every exponential equation in general if you can isolate your one exponential on one side and a constant on the other if you can't that means that you'll have two exponentials pick one on one side and one on the other now in either case if you do not have common bases you going to have to use a logarithm so we're going to do that right here so this is what's called not isolated when you have something added subtracted or multiplied by your exponential and that's on one side and a constant other you have to remove the coefficient or add or subtract to remove the constant in this case we're going to have to divide both sides by eight this is called isolated as far as exponential is concerned we're not really worried about the X+ one because that is in the exponent and it would help if we put some parentheses around that to show this is the exponent now here's what's going to have to happen we're going to have to choose on a basic exponential equation one of four ways to solve this we can either go directly to a logarithm using logarithmic notation or we can use a log on both sides in one of three different bases I'm going to show you all of those things right now so here's your your options I'm going to say this a couple more times but please remember if you have two exponentials like legit exponentials with variables this first way does not work you cannot go directly to one logarithm if you have two exponentials so here's the idea number one way we can do this is if you have one exponential and we have that here one exponential equal to a constant we can solve that logarithm by going directly to logarithmic notation we've actually seen that before so we just identify well what is our base well base is three what's our exponent our exponent is x + 1 and what they're equal to is 5/8 a logarithm will rewrite that for us it will solve for your exponent so logarithms take the base and the exponent and separate it on different sides of your equation so it takes your base of three your entire X X+ 1 can you see why we put that in parenthesis so we don't lose that so we don't accidentally add the or subtract one right now we have x + one on one side yeah we're going to subtract one but it's not from the 5/8 it's from a logarithm and then 5/8 is the inside of our logarithm and we're going to put that in parenthesis not because it's strictly necessary but because when we subtract one here in just a moment we don't want to accidentally subtract it from the argument of a logarithm that's exactly what we're going to do we have hey look a log them will solve for your exponent because your exponent contains your variable it's solving for your variable practically this is the easiest and most straightforward way to solve an exponential equation if there's just one exponential um is writing this directly as a logarithm now if we subtract one we're done that's as basic as this gets that's as simple as we can write this solution and it is a solution this is what's called an exact solution um it is not an approximation it has everything in there if you will if we wanted an approximation you'd have to plug that into your calculator now some of you can't because you cannot do anything beside a base of 10 or a base of of e like a natur a common log or a natural log respectively so what could you do if you had to approximate this we would use What's called the change of Base formula we talked about that it says pick whatever base you want well usually a base of 10 or a base of e and you could write this as a common log of 58 over a common log of three remember this goes on the numerator the base goes on the denominator and you pick whatever base you want in this case you pick a base of 10 because that's on your calculator and the minus one comes after that ratio so you plug this in or evaluate log of 58 now could you write that as log of 5 minus log you could do that is it beneficial it depends I mean sometimes maybe but here if we're just trying to approximate probably not just plug in a fraction then divide by log of three get that whatever that approximation is and then subtract one you could have also chosen Ln so if we take Ln and and use that as our new base we get Ln 58 over n Ln of 3 all minus one and that would equal x these are the three appropriate solutions that we can get out of this um is it okay to have any one of those yeah absolutely we're going to see that in the other three examples that we do so this is the most straightforward way to solve this isolate your exponential and then go directly to logarithmic notation however this does not always work if you have another exponential with a variable this technique won't work because you can't go to one logarithm if you have two different bases that would be a problem if you don't have two different bases you the same base then we wouldn't even be doing this we'd have the special case of hey I have common bases let's set the exponents equal so that wouldn't be relevant so let's go ahead and let's learn learn another technique that says well what would happen if we we don't have just one exponential these are going to they're all going to work but two of them are preferable so let's go to the next one so what if we add 3 to x + 1 = 5/8 again and we don't want to go directly to logarithm notation in x exponential equations you can do almost anything you want as long as you do it to both sides we can take a logarithm of both sides now why in the world do we want to do that well if an exponential's inverse is a logarithm a logarithm will undo that exponential so let's take a logarithm now the next two choices you have to solve these are you choose either a common log or a natural log most people use a natural log a common log is a base of 10 a natural log is a base of e now why do we want to do that is so that we don't have to go and do change of base anyway it already be in a base that's very usable for us for most people and their calculators so we choose a common log or a natural log to do that the last example is what if you were really smart and you took a logarithm both sides with a base that inherently matches here well that would be nice too so when you know what every want long do with both sides let's take a log of both sides let's choose a base 10 so that that way we can evaluate on our calculator when we get to the end very nicely so we would take our 3 x + 1 and our 58 and we would take a logarithm on both sides whatever base you want right but we're picking a base of 10 because that's on your calculator now why in the world this works on the right hand side you still have a constant logarithm of 58 is still a constant on the left hand side though y a logarithm allows us to solve an exponential is because it allows us oh this is a beautiful thing if you see it log base 10 of 3 x + 1 the x + one is now an exponent on the inside of your logarithm by the power property you can move that to the front of your logarithm so we would get x +1 * log of 3 = log of 5/8 they're still base 10 logarithms but by the power property we can move that exponent to the front as a coefficient now why is that useful well because that's now just something I can solve for I can solve for that X really nicely there's a couple things I really really want to point out to you that if you don't pay attention to anything else this is super important this is where almost every mistake comes from um moving on number one you absolutely have to have this exponent in parentheses when you move it to the front it's a must why because most of the time you're going to have to distribute that and if I allow you to write that without the X without the parenthesis some people aren't going to see it some people are going if I don't have those parentheses there are going to go oh I just subtract log of three and I'm done no you're not you make a very important choice and this second thing I want to bring up so number one you got to have parentheses it's a really big deal it shows what you're actually do shows you're multiplying the exponent times the logarithm secondly you make an important choice here the important important choice is you choose whether to distribute or not here's when to distribute firstly if you don't understand what I'm about to say do it all the time you can't really mess it up do it all the time distribute all the time and you can solve for x and not all that bad but if you don't if you if you do understand this if you have no other X's anywhere in your equation you don't have to distribute this you can divide by log of three and then subtract one that would be fun you could do that so dividing both sides by log of three we have this wait a minute that looks really really familiar because the same thing and if we subtract one we would get exactly this right here we would get exactly log of 58 over log of 3us one that is perfectly fine now I said also well wait a minute uh could you distribute you could distribute and it's not all that big of a deal but I want to show it to you to make sure that you see that our our answers can look different when do you have to distribute again you have to distribute if you have more than one X if you have any other X is FL anywhere around here you've got to distribute combine your X terms on one side your non-x terms on the other Factor an X and divide we've seen this is the fourth time that we will have seen this in this class this idea of oh yeah I have multiple things I'm trying to solve for distribute collect them Factor divide that's the idea I'm going to show that to you kind of preface what we're going to do after we finish these these four techniques on the next examples so this is cool we've already seen it it's exactly the same thing now what if we chose to distribute something you will have to do in some of the examples moving forward if we choose to distribute we get x * log of 3 plus 1 * log of 3 which just log of 3 as always I'm trying to train you on what where we're going to get to in a little while in a little while what's going to happen is you'll distribute you'll have an X term here and an X term here maybe somewhere else you will combine well you move your X terms to one side your non-x terms to the other then you'll factor and divide that's what we're going to get to in just a little while here we're kind of doing the same thing we're getting our X terms on one side that's this one that's already there this is not an X term that means you got to get rid of it so that you can divide appropriately we're going to subtract log of three I'm still keeping that 5/8 in parentheses so I don't accidentally subtract and lastly because we have one X term because that's connected by some coefficient this really is a coefficient log three is just a constant it's saying 10 to what power gives you three it's an exponent of 10 to that exponent gives you three it'll be some sort of decimal there but this represents a number we can divide by that so if we divide both sides by log of three here's what we would get remember that when you're dividing you can separate one fraction minus another fraction but take a look at what you would get this first fraction would be log of 58 over log of 3 minus log of 3 over log of 3 which is one and that's precisely the same thing that we get right here so which way is better well it that's a personal choice I suppose uh me I like to divide right here when I don't have to distribute but if I'm not confident on knowing what I need to distribute I'll distribute every time uh there are times when this will not work you cannot just divide it uh if you have X's anywhere else you have to distribute I hope that sounds for you let's move on to the next way so I'm going to start over with uh 3 to the x +1 equals 5/8 I'm going to take a log on both sides again but I'm going to do a natural log this is usually a very preferred way for people because it's Ln not a lot of writing uh less than log one less letter every time um and also that if you ever have a base of e a natural log automatically compos es with that now I want you to think about that for a second could you use a logarithm that automatically composes an inverse with an exponential what base would that be and that's our fourth technique so here we're going to choose a natural logarithm it's a very common thing for us to do and we would get on both sides log base e log base e what you do to one side you have to do the other it's going to model exactly like this so I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time doing this what this lets us do is if you have a logarithm on some exponential lets you move the exponent to the front as a coefficient but you got to keep it in parenthesis so that's x +1 ln3 Ln 58 think in your head right now do I absolutely have to distribute this do I have to absolutely have in parentheses yes do i abs have to distribute this not if there's no other X's but if there are then yes so this is a choice you make right now this is the only time you get a choice is when you don't have any other X's you can choose to divide right now which I'm going to do or distribute subtract and then divide which is modeled right here if you just change this to an Ln you get exactly the same thing so we're going to do x + 1 I'll divide both sides by Ln 3 I'll subtract one now how in the world do we know that this and this are the same as this over here or this right here well we can still do the change of Base but only in reverse think about this for a second if the change of Base says says that I pick whatever base I want just take the argument to the numerator base to the denominator pick whatever other uh base you want and you create this ratio can we go backwards well as long as we have the same base the answer is yeah so if we have log base e of 5/8 and log base e of three this is your new argument and this is your new base of some other logarithm provided these are the same base which they are so you could totally write this as log base 3 of 58 minus one you're just doing change of Base in Reverse these have the same base therefore I can combine them to one logarithm with that as the new base that as a new argument same thing would happen here you have log base 10 hey those have the same base new logarithm would have a log of this would be the argument this would be the base exactly like that one so they're all equivalent they just look a little bit different they're all valid whatever you want now the last one we already know we can do a logarithm on both sides of an equation provided we actually do it to both sides and we also know that like an Ln composed with a an exponential base e or a a common log composed with an exponential base 10 simplify because youve naturally compose an exponential onto its inverse which is a logarithm then that's great well can we make that happen here what if we took this and said you know what we know about logarithms and exponentials being inverses what if I took a very specific logarithm what if I took a log base 3 now why would I want to do log base 3 notice you have to do it on both sides but if you do log base 3 of 3 wait a minute that's a logarithm base 3 an exponential base 3 you compose a function on its inverse they will cancel out they will give you the exponent you could move the exponent to the front and you get a one there and you go oh yeah I remember that property do you remember it log base 3 of three to whatever power you have is the power that you have that's what we're doing right here this no matter what you do you're going to get just x + one if we subtract one we get the same thing we've got every other time this really is the same as writing this as a as logarithmic not ation it's just showing a little bit of more work uh either way you go it's going to come out the same preferentially you'd probably pick a common log or a natural log because that would be very easy to evaluate on your calculator this one you'd have to change your base would you you say hey I want a log base 10 or log base e and write this as Ln 58 over ln3 exactly what we had right there minus one so I hope I've made that make sense these are the four options that you have to solve a basic exponential now we're going to move on and this one's going to fall off the map and so really is this one uh because both of those deal with a very specific base what if I have two bases well then would benefit us for one exponential but not the other and so we typically pick a natural logarithm to do this or a common log in some cases but most of the time just a natural so we're going to come back with a couple more examples and show that all right now I'm not giving you a whole bunch of examples in this video I'm really giving you only five I've done one of them like four different ways but these next two are going to illustrate a lot of different examples kind of in one a lot of different examples look like one of these two uh and the the reason why I'm only giving you a couple is because really there's not much else that doesn't fit in one of these categories there there are some substitutions I'm going to give you the next two examples but if you're going to solve some exponential equations there's typically those you can isolate on one side and then do what I just showed you in the previous example those which have two exponentials but have a common base which I've showed you in previous videos or those have two exponentials that don't have a common base that's what we're dealing with here so we have two exponentials they certainly don't have common bases not not present and and not available you can't write a five as a two you can't write a five and a two as some other base so that's off the table also we have an inability to isolate an exponential here like we have two of them so we can't get one of them on one side and a constant on the other side which is why the first technique I taught you the last example is not going to work here you can't write this in as one logarithm with one base with two different bases that's not going to work so we're on to one of the last three examples uh last three I guess methods in the previous example could we could we choose to do like a log base 2 on both sides yes you could but what's going to happen is you'll end up doing a change of base later if you want to approximate it so I'm going to I'm going to give you one of do one of two things choose to do a common log on both sides or a natural log I'm always going to do a natural log because I prefer it um also when we see in the next example natural log is really nice when we match a base with a base now you could have done that here but we deal with some other issues if we we end up doing that so um not hard issues but but issues maybe I'll show that to you in just a just a bit so so let's take a look at it so it's got two exponentials we don't have a common base we can't isolate one the only way to solve exponentials like this without common bases are to use a logarithm and we're going to apply a on both sides we're going to pick a natural log so an Ln on both sides of this equation what's going to allow us to do is move our exponent to the front right here is also where I always write parentheses around that exponent why because I know I'm going to move it and if I have them now I'll be able to move it later and not forget them so I'm going to do a natural L it's got to be on both sides you don't have an option here what you do to one side you have to do the other but once we've done that we change an exponential kind of into a logarithm and allows us to move by the power property these exponents as coefficients as products next to a logm I've done a mistake on purpose I want you to see it this is I see this a lot when I'm grading test things like that I see students who do this and they understand the property they really get it but then they fail to do one little thing and it leads to a lot of problems do you see how if I do this this looks like a term and this looks like a term and it's not there's a product here this is the case if I write it correctly where you must distribute I hope that you can Jose this with the previous example said oh you might have to might not but look if you have x's in other place beside this one right here beside one parentheses one parenthetical expression if you have anywhere else you must distribute get your X terms on one side your non-x terms on the other side Factor this side and then divide so that's our our necessary process for solving these there's really not another way to go about doing it because X's are in multiple places if we just start dividing here we're going to make this side even worse so distribute everything right now that's why we put the parenthesis and that's why we're noticing multiple X's so we can make that judgment call so we've distributed we know that we can distribute ln2 we can distribute ln5 we're kind of doing backwards distribution but it doesn't really matter and now we're noticing that hey look there's one two terms with x's we need to group those so that we can Factor there's one two terms without X's we need get those on the opposite side so that we don't have to worry about factoring those because they don't have X's they wouldn't anyway so I'm going to add 2X ln5 and subtract ln2 we're going to watch our signs be real careful is really easy to make signs when we're make sign errors when we're moving terms around so I've added 2X ln5 I've subtracted ln2 my other signs look pretty good this is why we want to do it so that we can group our X terms grouping X terms every every term that has an X in it we can factor that X terms that don't have X's don't need that so are on the other side so we don't have to we don't have to worry about factoring something they don't have so factoring X we factor x and get ln2 we factor x and get 2 Ln 5 this is great this is exactly what we want because what it does now is it creates a product for us and how we undo products is with division before that we had two x's we couldn't really divide it wouldn't be relevant but now that we have that factored version of it we can divide both sides by whatever that expression is so Ln 5us ln2 all divid ln2 + 2 Ln 5 it's pretty wordy that's lots of LNS can you see it differently could you see it differently yeah you really could now this is perfectly appropriate you you can you can do this this is approximable but I do want you to see that there is some simplification possible for instance can you combine two logarithms of the same base that they're being subtracted yeah of course you can create one logarithm the same base with a a fraction or a quotient inside so 5 over two inside of a logarithm on your denominator can you combine two logarithms being added if they have the same base yeah you can but you'd have to move a coefficient as an exponent so wait a minute this is ln2 plus Ln 5^ SAR if you move that as an exponent that's Ln 2 + Ln of 25 how do you combine two logarithms being added with the same base well you multiply you that plus creates a product inside one logm so Ln of 50 you could see that you could certainly see that you could even have a 2.5 there but you could certainly see that in the back of a textbook because they combine all this now if you got this and you look at that clearly you're going to go I made a mistake you haven't they've just combined some things in fact we can do one more now I would leave it here because that's easiest to approximate on your calculator it's going to basic be you got an Ln button that's great notice something I'm going to pause right here and just say this could you have done a common log and just put log everywhere and got the same thing with log and log yes absolutely and it does not make a difference this is why I'm not showing it to you I'm not going to repeat this the same steps with just that word log that's fine what you could do though here is because you have the same base in a fraction I'm hoping you see it do you see that we can use change of Base in Reverse we could really write this as a log with a base of 50 and a new argument of five halves now I don't know if that's better or worse uh but that is one logarithm notice it's not Ln anymore you changed the base you said these have the same base of E I can combine this make this my new base and my new argument andate create one logarithm that's as concise as we can make it there nothing better that we can do with that as far as I know now I did say there is another way to do this um you'll see that you have to do a change of Base somewhere or you end up with something just like this so approximate might not be the best but from here could you choose a logarithm with a base of two a base of five and get the same thing yes you can um I don't care which base you choose it's kind of a whatever you want to do in it but if we did let's take a log base 2 of both sides so on this side notice what happens this is the important side for you see if you choose a log base 2 you inherently match a logarithm and an exponential and compose a function with its inverse and you are going to get x + 1 on the right hand side though you have log base 2 of 5 to 1 - 2x well because that is an exponent you have to solve that by moving this to the front of your your logarithm then Distributing then collecting your X terms your non-x terms and dividing I wouldn't say it's better or worse it's just different now do you have to distribute well I just said you did but the reason reason is because you have an X here and X here you must distribute this we got to collect our X terms and our non-x terms so adding and subtracting respectively Factory and then dividing I'm keeping this five in parentheses so that I don't accidentally subtract that one that would be good now that looks decidedly different as what we got right there is it the same thing yes but it might take you some work to actually see it um I hesitated for a second cuz I didn't know if I really wanted to show you but I do cuz always do time darn it uh look if you change this to log base 2 of 25 so move that as an exponent get log base 2 of 25 and then you can write this as Ln 5 over ln2 change of base and ln25 over ln2 change of Base do you notice that your LCD of ln2 on this complex fraction you can multiply ln2 over ln2 it would distribute cancel here and get ln5 minus ln2 that's that it would distribute here that' be ln2 and cancel ln25 here's ln2 and this is ln25 so it is the same thing it just looks decidedly different way way different and that's one thing you find out with logarithms is that sometimes what you get can look fundamentally different from someone else's answer and they're both right because there's lots of different techniques that are equivalent lots of different properties that will do the same desired effect on this and so don't really worry about it as long as you follow an appropriate technique what I'm showing you here one of these two things you're going to be fine I hope that makes sense to you I hope that you see that we can get a different look but it's still exactly the same thing all right we're going to move on to the next one before we do our substitution so we have e to x + 3 = pi to X that looks kind of crazy um this is one reason why a lot of people use LM and this one is for sure you're going to want to do that it's kind of the same reason is using Ln or log of two here because you get this cancel thing going on and you deal with something with a different base on the side that's okay but with a log base e you don't have to write that that base so it looks a little cleaner and a natural log is something we can automatically evaluate on our calculators so that's very nice very convenient so we qual we um we qualify this so we say what what it looks like is this an exponential where you can have common bases uh no that's that's not going to happen is this an exponential equation where you have an exponent exponential on one side and a constant other no we have two valid exponentials both of whom have both of which have variables in their exponent so we cannot do those two techniques we have to we're forced to do a logarithm on both sides so you could choose a log base 10 y or we could choose a log base e yes why a natural log that already has a base of e so when we do a logarithm on both sides and we choose that base of e in our logarithm it inherently composes a function with its inverse and it doesn't make the other side worse like it kind of did over here that was a little bit tedious to work through what it does it says this is a log base e this is exponential base e we know from our properties that's going to simplify and we just get x + 3 do you need to move this to the front of your your your logarithm you can but it's not going to be relevant you're just going to get Ln of e to the first Power you get a one one * x + 3 gives you x + 3 this property is fine you're using a property of exponential oh sorry logarithms right here to say when you compose a function it's inverse it does cancel on the right hand side nothing really happens besides the fact that we have to move this to the front as a coefficient now there's no distribution to do like we had to do over here because we just have that x to the first Power not added or subtracted if I would have put like a minus two here then yeah I'd have to distribute and combine my X it would look very much like this example or this example which is why I'm not showing that to you I've already done that so if that had like a minus two we'd have to have an x minus 2 and then distribute in this case we're going to group our X terms on one side our non-x terms on the other this is telling you you're going to have to factor and divide so I've subtracted X Ln pi and subtracted 3 now that we have all our X terms grouped we can factor that X and lastly we're going to divide both sides we're done that's about as clean as I can make it there's no other there's only one logarithm and so there's no logs I can combine I hope that you're seeing why we like to use Ln a lot it's a little easier to write it's on your calculator and it cleans up every time we see an e and composite with a natural log it's very very nice also you're noticing one thing you're noticing me not really plugging in a lot of these to say hey what about our domain remember something our domain for exponentials is all real numbers so it doesn't matter what we plug in to our exponentials we're going to be able to get something out what that means is that we're never having a domain issue now the range of an exponential is from zero to positive Infinity not including the zero remember that you can't plug in a number to an exponential and get zero unless it's been shifted so there will be some horizontal ASM tootes somewhere on our exponentials what that also meant for logarithms was that your domain has to be reversed from an exponential and your range is reversed from an exponential let me explain a little bit better if your domain of an exponential is all real numbers your range for a logarithm is all real numbers if your range for exponential is from0 to Infinity your domain for a logarithm is from 0 to Infinity is that a problem when we start taking a logarithm on both sides because we should always be thinking of the domain right um two functions are inverses on their domains respectively so so think about that when I take a logarithm of both sides of an exponential do I have a problem am I saying oh that could be negative I'm not because an exponential can only give me out positives it cannot give me out negatives unless it's been shifted around and that would be a constant added afterwards added after your exponential we don't have that that's always positive that's always positive and so when I take a logarithm of both sides no matter which one I do this is always positive this is always positive that logorithm is saying I need my inside to be positive exponential says no problem I can't even give you a I can't even give you zero so we're not breaking a domain issue when we take a logarithm on both sides of our exponentials I hope that you're seeing that seeing that yeah I'm doing a logarithm and the insides have to be positive but exponentials range is from 0 to Infinity that matches perfectly with the domain of a logarithm being 0 to Infinity that we need to use a logarithm anyhow that's why this technique Works they are inverses on their respective domain okay I hope you're ready we got a couple ones that look a little weird um when you see this you see several terms mainly like three terms and you have some things that say I cannot possibly isolate an exponential here um I can't get two exponentials one on each side and so I will not be able to use the common basis directionals equal I won't be able to use a direct take a log of both sides I don't just have one of one of these one exponential I can't combine them and so I won't be able to go straight to a logarithm typically what you'll do here is a substitution technique and so here's the thought process if I've got not all exponentials I can't isolate one and I can't make them equal so I can't use logarithms common basis I'm going to have to change it to something that's not an exponential to solve it and then put the exponential back so when we take a look at it all right can I write this as something where the first term and the second term have the same exponential right now they don't right now we have 2 2X and 2 X+ 2 those are very different they have the same base though that's very important and then a constant well you don't necessarily need the constant but can I write the at least the first two terms or all the terms if you want if there are more than that um as having the same exponential that we can substitute so we're going to do things like use some exponent rules to rewrite these a little bit and I'm going to walk you through that so something like 2 2X and 2 X+ 2 firstly identify what your exponential wants to be we probably going to work this down to 2 to the X well that means I need to rewrite the first term as 2 to the X and the second term is 2 the x times something else or to another power so if I want to write the first term is 2 the X and the second term is 2 the X think about what 2 2x means 2x is 2 * X now how do we get 2 * X for exponentials well that had to come from an exponent raised to another exponent because when an exponent is raised to another one we multiply those so this came from 2 x^2 notice how this still makes 2 2x so we're just thinking through kind of the opposite of some exponent rules and writing this as something that's going to be the same as another part of my function another term part of that term now how about uh 2 x + 2 well I I need to the X but x + 2 how do I add exponents exponents that are added came from common bases that were multiplied that's not right but that is what I want second so X to or 2 the 2x came from x * 2 x * 2 is 2X x 2 x + 2 came from 2 x * 2 the 2 notice how if I were to combine those I would get common base I would get 2 to the x + 2 I would add those exponents that's where that came from and then- 12 so we've pretty much accomplished what we set out to do if we simplify that just a little bit that's just four when you're trying to do a substitution we're trying to make the first term and the second term have the same exact inside in this case the same exact exponential to the X and then we have these Powers whatever we have it doesn't really matter we're trying to get that out of there so when we accomplish that when we look at this and say hey I can rewrite these and I can rewrite them so I have the same exponential in two spots and nowhere else well then I'm going to do a substitution I'm going to call that U now we're going to use that twice we've seen this several times we know that we're going to get away from 2 to the X and then later on we'll go back to it almost always what you get is going to be factorable so get everything on one side get in order first ter POS POS and Factor it if it's not factorable I'm not going to do one for you this time I'm really not if it's not factorable you need quadratic formula if it's higher than a power two you need another technique to solve it but ultimately once you solve it you go back to the hey the U solve for is 2 to the X put that back and then continue with the logarithm and you can do that given you four techniques on how to do that um so but most of these are factorable if not quadratic formula it's kind of nasty but they are they are factorable most times so this would be U + 6 u - 2 = 0 uh we can check it but that's going to be correct zero property says keep on going now you're not done you're so close but you're not done we're remember that we're not trying to solve for U we're trying to solve for x and our X is wrapped up in exponential we said U is 2 X so if U = -6 then 2 x = -6 and if u = 2 then 2 x = 2 now what do we do well we think firstly let's think about this one 2 x = -6 you go wait a minute I thought exponentials had to be positive that's true and sometimes in these techniques we get a false solution this is not valid your exponential can't equal negative do you remember they have a horizontal ASM toote of zero they can't even get below zero unless you start shifting them and that's not shifted so this right here is not okay uh this right here is not a valid solution there's no X you can plug in to make this actually happen now if you tried to if you went to a logarithm you said hey my base is 2 my exponent is X you end up with a domain issue a range issue listen a range issue for an exponential what you get out is a range issue a range problem for an exponential becomes a domain problem for your logarithm why because range and domain switch for every inverse relationship that you have as far as functions are concerned including exponential logarithms this is not a valid solution creates a domain issue for the logarithm a range issue for the exponential either way you just can't have it now what about this one you can write this as logarithm or you can just think about it these have common bases hey that's kind of nice two and two equal which means X has to equal that expon of one now in general this is not what you're you're going to have to do right you're going to have to write this as logarithm so you you certainly can because your base is two log base 2 solves for that so log base 2 of 2 = x here's your base here's your exponent we separate those with the logarithm and this uses a very nice property say you compos a function with his inverse that's exactly what we said you're with the same base anyway and you would get xal 1 I'm going to walk you through a couple others what would happen if this wasn't a two what if this was a one if that was a one you you you can think about it just think two to what power gives you one uh any base to what power gives you one you have to have zero that would bear out right here so if I had base of 2 exponent of x a logorithm separates the base from the exponent puts what the exponent equals to as your argument and says hey that's another property we have log base I don't care of one is always zero then zero would equal x okay what if it wasn't one of those special cases that you showed me Leonard what if it was like seven what if log base L sorry 2 the xal 7 well logarithm still writes it as log base 2 = x and you'd have seven right there this is a solution this is fine you're done you don't have to do anything more now if you're asked to approximate which you almost always are then you could do a change of Base pick Ln pick log base 10 doesn't really matter and you can evaluate that ratio so those are the three cases that we typically get when we're doing a substitution we never get this whole um exponential equals exponential with uh without the common base we never get variables on both sides so those previous examples aren't really relevant for a substitution because we don't really get that well we end up getting something that looks like this or the two previous ones that I gave you and then we can go directly to a logarithm now could you you could you do Ln on both sides move your your exponent and divide you could but it is easiest to go directly to a logarithm and that's why I showed you that first technique in the first example that we did so that this would become easier so I hope that makes sense our real answer was uh was one I just want to show that to you just so we're kind of complete here all right last one I'll discuss one more with you but I'm not going to solve it all the way I'll discuss it this last one that we're actually go way through we're going to look at this and we're going to firstly recognize what it's talking about this is an exponential equation yes but categorize it is this something where I have one exponential well no that means that I can't isolate it and get a constant other side and then use direct logorithm is this something where I have two exponentials where I can get one on one side and one on the other side either for common bases or for logarithms direct use of logarithms no because that five messes it up actually that 2K messes up two I can't just get one log one exponen on one side one on the other and do a log of both sides it's not going to work I'm going to have to do a substitution so if I'm going to have to do a substitution I'm going to make this so that I have the same exponential in two terms of my expression here in my equation so I'm looking at this thinking well what's the best choice for our base uh 49 looks like it be simplified into a base of seven so we're going to do that first so I'm thinking I want to write this as a base of s this is 7 SAR now that's all well and good but that doesn't help us why well because that's 7 to the X and that's 7 to the 2 I need them to be the same but take a look at what happens if I have seven to the second power to the X power I can multiply that 2 * X but wait a minute 2 * X means the same thing as x * 2 so could I just reverse those keep this in mind if 2 * X is 2x then if I put an X here and a two there that would still be 2x I'm really hoping that you see that because multiplication is commutative you can have those two exponents in whatever order you want and they still make um 49 to the X honestly they still make the same thing so whether I have 7 to the x or 7^ s x it doesn't matter so I'm going to choose this one because it fits what we're trying to do here fits with the I'm trying to match the the exact same exponential in two terms of my equation I also show those in parentheses to make my substitution a little bit more noticeable so if my my 7 to the X exponential is going to change into U I've got two and then this becomes u^2 11 U and then + 5 okay so uh let's go ahead and factor that it's going to be factorable almost all the time just be careful when they're not you have to use a different technique uh check your factor it's probably factorable so this is going to factor as common mistake you're not in X's right now you're in U so when you factor you got to use U so we've got 1 U + 5 we've got 2 U + 1 we can double check this that's 2 u^2 plus u and plus 10 U that's 11 U and then + 5 the zero product property is going to set each of these equal to zero right now looks just fine but the next thing we're going to do hopefully you understand this is not so fine when we do this right now we're going to look at this and go wait hang on a second I've got two negative numbers here those cannot be Solutions because exponentials cannot equal negatives now I'm going to make real clear this is not a domain issue for your exponential you can plug in anything that you want this is a range issue this is saying what can you plug in to get this output you can't there is it's a range issue there's no way to get out5 and2 from 7 to the x it becomes a domain issue for our logarithm if we were to try to do it we'd get log base 7 of5 and log base 7 of2 that's a domain issue because it came from a range issue of an exponential hope that makes sense if we would have had positive now we don't I know we don't but if we would have had positive then you'd be just fine you can say all right this would be log base 7 of 5 log base 7 of 12 = X please listen this will give you a negative that would be fine to get a negative out but you can't have a negative inside your logarithm that would be plugging in a negative for your exponential that's okay you can plug in a negative here that'd be fine to plug in a negative but it can't give you one out so what you can't get out of an exponential is what you can't plug in to a logarithm I can plug in negatives I can't get out negatives I can can't plug in netives I can get out negatives for logarithms so these would be your two solutions if these had been positive I just want to show that to you to make sure we saw that one more time um you could show it differently of course you could do a log of both base seven of both sides and Ln of both sides move your X divide a log base 10 of both sides move your expent divide you could also do change of base and get log of five over log of 7 or Ln 5 over Ln 7 same thing over there and get a different different look so that you can approximate it a little bit easier but that's where I'm going to end on these problems is this idea once you get down to here this is something we've talked about already you cannot let them equal negatives in this case you have no solution it's not possible to do okay I felt bad that I gave you one with no solution feels like you didn't get what you paid for even though for most of you this is absolutely free um so I'm going to give you one more I feel like it and I can uh so sometimes these negative exponents just go what and I'm stuck and I don't want to do and I wanted to show how to do that and that you can get one solution out of these at least this one does um so let's take a look at that 3 x - 14 * 3x = 5 firstly classify or qualify it where does it fit is this one exponential no can I combine those no not with subtraction do not try you can't do it uh okay can I get one exponential on one side and one on the other side without a constant to use common bases no because the five messes it up and so is A- 14 can I get one exponential one side one on the other side with different bases and use a logorithm no because for the same reason this is another substitution but you have to set it up correctly we must get the same exponential in order to substitute it and we have to have it in two terms so what are we going to do for our techniques to work by the way what are we going to do if you see a negative exponent there's two choices and this is what your text we say multiply by x to the POS 1 oh sorry um I said that wrong multiply by 3 to postive X you can do that on both sides but it might be a little easier to see why you're doing that if I should and it's the same thing but maybe write a little differently so you see why you're doing that remember that a negative exponent creates a fraction with whatever is being raised to that negative exponent on the denominator right where it's at so this means this this means 3 this means 1 over 3 POS X so 14 * 1 over 3 POS X gives you 14 over 3 x this is why they're telling you multiply by 3 x why because this is now a an equation has fractions in it how do you get rid fractions you multiply by the L CD in this case that's just 3 x now do we have a domain issue by having that on the denominator no because 3 x can't even equal zero oh it's horizontal ASM you can't even equal that so there is no problem all we've got to do is understand that in either case what we want to multiply by is something that makes that negative go away well that's going to be 3 to the X now you keep this in mind it's got to be on both sides whether you do it here or here doesn't matter it has to be on both sides because you're multiplying in equation so multiply both sides by whatever takes that negative exponent that negative exponent means something on the denominator that needs to go away in our case it's 3 to X we're going to multiply and then distribute um if I distribute here I'm going to get 3 to the x^2 don't write three to the uh the 2x don't don't add them write them as what you're going to need for the substitution so 3 x * 3 x is 3 x^ 2 could you write it as 3 2x yes but you're going to get exactly what you got here that's where that came from it came from 2 x * 2 x that gave you 2 2x which we had to write as 2 x^2 so this is the same thing is that but we've written it more appropriately for our substitution work that gives you 3 to X Quan squ this your denominator is going to cancel with that so 3 x * 14 over 3 x you cancel that you get- 14 you go wait a minute my substitution doesn't work ah It's Tricky that's why on the other side of the equation we had to multiply by 5 * 3 x there's your other term with your 3 X in it so we're going to everything on one side because we're going to substitute and then Factor please notice that doing it right here is the same thing you get 3 to x^2 you'd get -4 * 3x * 3 POS XX I'll show it multiplying common bases you add your exponents x * or plus positive x is 0 3 0 is 1 you just get4 either way personally I think that's a little easier to see but they do work the same whichever one you feel confident with it's going to work perfectly for you so now we're set up we have a substitution available to us that's 3 x so we're going to substitute that and get U ^2 - 5 u - 14 = 0 this factors pretty nicely for us if you do it right u^2 that would be plus that' be - 5 U and -4 can you see which of these is going to give give us a nonvalid solution for real numbers hopefully you say I cannot allow an exponential to equal a negative that's off the table your exponentials can't give you a negative it's a range issue becomes a domain issue for a logarithm that we would need to solve that this however looks really good so I do a log of both sides move my X and divide log of any BAS you want doesn't really matter log base 3 cool log base 10 cool log Bas e it doesn't matter I would move this to the front that's one option that's very easy to approximate another option use log base 10 you get log of 7 over log of 3 very easy to approximate or making it more concise from here you can do a change of base and pick the base of three and an argument of seven in a new logarithm and that's exactly what we get if we went directly from our exponential to a logarithm you say hey here's my base here's my exponent log base 3 of 7 would equal x because a logarithm separates base from exponent either one of those is going to work just fine I hope that this has made sense I've gone above and beyond I think as far as our our examples here I've shown you every case I could think of uh to solve an exponential so I hope that you're with me um moving forward we're basically done with what I need you to know with exponentials we're going to go on to how to use them in some real life scenarios like finance and like um differential equations but only as an introduction to exponential growth and Decay so I'll see you for those videos and I hope you do them all
