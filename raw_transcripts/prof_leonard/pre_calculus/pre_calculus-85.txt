Transcript for: Graphing Transformations with Sine and Cosine (Precalculus - Trigonometry 12)
hey welcome to another video so in this video man we got an important one we we learned how to graph sine and cosine with some transformations in there so we're going to learn what happens and when we adjust the period of sine and cosine we're going to use that in tangent and cotangent secant and cosecant later on but it all starts right here so here's what we're going to learn in this video we're going to learn that when you start multiplying the inside the argument of your trig functions it's going to start adjusting your period how often this repeats either closer or further that's a horizontal stretch or compression we're going to learn what happens when you start multiplying the function right here in front of that function how that affects the output in terms of its amplitude we're going to learn how to shift this and all these things will be very relevant and very much like if you've learned how i've taught you graphing previously with all of your transformations the only thing we're not getting into right now is called a phase shift so a phase shift is the horizontal transformation the horizontal shift left or right it's always opposite what's ever in that parenthesis and the same thing holds here so what i intend to teach is the four steps on how to graph these tree functions there's gonna be five when we talk about a horizontal shift a phase shift um but honestly it's not that bad if you follow these steps you're going to get it right like every single time and i'm going to walk you through exactly how to do it so here's the first thing whenever we look at how to graph sine and cosine the following steps i need to be in your head number one i need you to find that period so i'm going to show you exactly how to deal with that our period we always write t for period is 2 pi y 2 pi well 2 pi because the original period of every sine and cosine function is 2 pi and still until we start manipulating that stretching that or compressing that 2 pi divided by we call it omega it's this number that's right in front of x when we get to phase shifting i'm going to show you how that works a little bit more clearly if you have something added subtracted but for right now it's just this number in front of x so we take our period 2 pi and divide it by that omega now think about this what would it be for tangent so tangent has a period of not 2 pi has a period of pi and so we'd have for tangent pi over omega so please be clear on that that this period is for sine and cosine which is why i have it right here under that we're going to find our period first after that we're going to identify any sort of vertical shift plus up minus down with with what's added or subtracted at the end of our function and we're going to graph it in this order we're going to first put our period down we're going to put the end of our period half our period and quarters of our period why well that's how i introduced graphene to you in the last video then we're going to show our shifting up or down at that point we'd show our our shifts uh left to right as well and then per period back there but we're not there yet for phase shifting then we're going to mark our x-intercepts remember this for sine our x-intercepts happen at the ends and the center of our period for cosine it's at the corners of our period finally we'll take our key points our peaks at the quarters for sine at the ends and center for cosine and we'll use our a to multiply the the outputs of those key points and that'll give us a very very clear graph one thing is that that a that letter a can do two things for you it will cause you to stretch or compress and it'll also cause you to reflect if it's negative the absolute value of that a is caller amplitude and it will give you how high you go above the x-axis and how low you go in terms of absolute value so we can talk about that as well i the way i'm teaching you generally don't need that exactly um some textbooks do use it though so let's get right to it let's talk about three sine x i want to lead you through this as efficiently as possible i'm going to give you the steps to show you exactly how and why we're doing that whenever you graph any sort of a trig function the first thing you need is whatever the period is so we're going to take the period which is for sine 2 pi and we're going to divide that by whatever number is being multiplied by x that's going to be 1 in this case so 2 pi divided by 1 is 2 pi now i'm not doing that just a borax i'm doing that to show you this is the process you take every time you take the period of your trig function you divide it by omega that's the number in front of x and whatever you get is your period stop right there don't do anything else put that period on your x-axis so what i mean by that is at this point since we know that we have two pi as our period we're going to go from zero we're going to mark two pi and you go how do i know where two pi is who cares it's not the scale anyway just put 2 pi on there somewhere now every important feature of sine and cosine happens at quarters ends and half of your period which is why we're dealing with the period first it will determine your key points for you in just a minute so put the two pi on there whatever the end of your period is put that down cut it in half that's pi cut each portion in half so half of pi is pi over two that makes sense that half of it divided by two if you want to find the other half of it add whatever that is to whatever that is so pi over 2 to now i'm saying whatever that is not specifically pi because it changes on your period but find the end of your period find half of it cut this first half in half again that's pi over 2 and then add this to this so pi over 2 plus 2 pi over 2 is 3 pi over 2 pi over 2 plus 1 pi that's 2 pi over 2 is 3 pi over 2. so number one we find our period great we've determined that it's 2 pi we put that down we cut it in half cut it in half again why because important things happen at the ends the center and the quarters cut in half again and then add these two together it will give you whatever that that middle or sorry the second quarter is i guess it's third quarter but whatever this quarter is it you can always find it by adding the quarter plus the half will give you the three quarters that's exactly how fractions work now identify what trig function you're working with so we we've done the period we don't have a vertical shift we look here there's nothing added or subtracted right now if we would have had that we would have said okay here's my period i'd shift this up or down i'd redraw like an x-axis and then redo my period on top of that so i draw that right there and since we don't have that we're gonna move on a little bit and say okay we've done this we don't have a vertical shift mark your x-intercepts this is what was really important i spent probably 10 minutes talking about last video probably more than that is you need to know what your x-intercepts do for sine and for cosine for sine our x-intercepts are at the ends and center of your period no so i'm not saying i'm not saying 0 pi and 2 pi why not because our period can change our period can phase shift and so i'm saying ends in center in your head i need you to know that sine has x-intercepts it ends and centered of period so i'm going to mark that down so ends and center so done the period wrote the period broke it into quarters got that you can also do that mathematically too just divide by two divide by four uh divide by three quarters and you can figure out what uh what those quarters are as well i've done that i've identified i don't have a vertical shift at all i know that we're with sine i'm dealing with n's and center for x-intercepts and now the quarters that you have for sine or the n's and center for cosine whatever you have not put a point on here and here those become your key points so if we have a visual of how sine looks in our head our x-intercepts are ends in center and our peak is at pi over 2 1 and 3 pi over 2 negative 1. that should have been familiar from the last video we know that pi over 2 1 and 3 pi over 2 negative 1 what if you forget that look at your unit circle and think about the quarter of a circle now i'm not really saying quarter of a period here sorry um pi over two same quarter of the circle and three quarters of the circle that's the first quarter and third quarter this is what it will be is pi over 2 1 and pi over 2 negative 1. those key points allow you to multiply but whatever that number is that's going to to stretch this or compress it and possibly reflect it so again period got it we cut it up got it n's and center for sine for x-intercepts we got it what we don't have points for are your quarters for sine so create some key points key points are things that allow us to manipulate the look that's pi over 2 1 and 3 pi over 2 negative 1 that was on our original graph and those are always going to be the cases for sine you'll have your first quarter comma 1 your third quarter comma negative 1 and then multiply it by whatever your amplitude is but not with the absolute value whatever your a is positive or negative it will allow you to reflect it so in our case times three and times three now this should be really familiar if you've had this we've had me before in these videos you should understand that what that three does that three is a factor for the output so think about that when you plug in a number to here you'd have sine of whatever that is sine of this is going to give you some sort of an output this output gets multiplied by three so use a three to multiply the output not the input there's nothing here that's that's being multiplied right now one is being multiplied right now not three this factor multiplies the output of sine this factor multiplies the output of sine and this is how we affect our key points so pi over two your inputs will never ever change your outputs will change one times three is three negative 1 times 3 is negative 3. uh hopefully you're seeing that this is all we're doing is multiplying our output times our a notice something how if that were negative this would become negative 3 and it would reflect it instead of going up it'd go down it's a great way to graph this and we're just going to plot our two key points so for sine you'll only have two because only the peaks and valleys happen at the quarters so pi over two comma three hey we already have that marked down that's great we did that so that we could even get our key points in the first place so pi over two comma three and three pi over two comma negative three now really you know i've squished my scale so here's how our graph looks so our graph is this sine function it goes forever we've just graphed one period what if you had to graph more than one cycle or more than one period well you would just double you double this so if you had to do two cycles of this take your two pi and double it what would you get 4 pi and then add 2 pi to every one of these and you'll get a new period notice you're not doubling everything because pi over 2 times 2 is well that would just be pi so you're not doubling that you're taking doubling your period that's 4 pi then adding 2 pi pi over 2 plus 2 pi will give you the next quarter of the next cycle do that now i'm going to superimpose something let's superimpose what would be the original sine function you're going to see something here that is exactly what a vertical stretch will do it'll take your original dotted line sine function and grow it so it increases what's called the amplitude so the amplitude is this value of three how high it gets above the x-axis and below the x-axis in terms of its absolute value that is what the amplitude relates to so i hope that made it make sense to you i hope you understand that the way that i'm trying to show you here is a way that i've already given you for transformations we just have something new in terms of this repeatedness of your trig function of this every two pi for the period idea so i hope it makes sense i hope that you're really seeing what's going on the reason why i'm having to do these steps in these orders let's practice a couple more of them all right let's talk about y equals negative 4 cosine x i'm going to start moving a little bit quicker here talking about our period pretty quick talking about where our x-intercepts are and our our key points as relating to the uh the quarters or the n and center for whatever trig function we're trying to find so y equals negative four cosine x the very first thing we do with every trig function is identify what our period is and maybe what it changes to if we're multiplying the input by anything so for cosine our period is originally 2 pi remember sine cosine secant cosecant are going to have periods of 2 pi tangent doesn't has a period of pi so identify whatever your period is originally divided by whatever number is being multiplied by your input i say that specifically because for a phase shift you might have to factor something out first here we just divide by 1 and we get that our period is 2 pi draw that first draw your period cut it in half cut it in half again add these two it'll give you your third quarter so we've identified our period we've shown our period we've shown our quarters of our period so first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter that's going to be our entire period after that what we're going to do is identify what sort of a vertical shift we have if we have any that will always be added or subtracted adding or subtracting think about why that would happen if i plug a number in cosine of that number is going to give me an output this would multiply that output but then something added or subtracted would literally add or subtract to or from the output that's a vertical idea that's a vertical shift whenever we have something added or subtracted now we don't have that here but we would show it we'd show it as an adjustment of our x-axis sort of like a new x-axis moving up or moving down a phase shift would also happen here and we would shift to the right or to the left at this point and show that with a y-axis movement so we've shown our period we've got that we don't have a vertical shift what we're going to do now is identify that for cosine our x-intercepts happen not at the ends and center like sine but at the quarters what that means is that if these are x-intercepts our peaks and valleys our key points are going to be at the ends and center of our period notice i'm not saying one zero and pi and two pi i'm saying whatever your periods change to take the ends and the center you've already marked it down it's why we do it first so that you can identify your key points i hope that makes sense to you that if you don't show your period first you might have a very hard time finding the ends in the center if your period is not just a standard two pi so i'm going to show that my key points are zero pi and 2 pi and it relates to our original cosine we're going to we're gonna take these key points we're gonna adjust them by multiplying by negative four but i wanna write them out first remember our key points from our original cosine function we've got in the last video are you'd have zero one pi negative one or first the the versus zero is one and then negative one and then one if you forget that look at your unit circle the original cosine do the original one then change it so if you look at your unit circle and you say hey cosine of zero is zero i'm sorry one that's not right and cosine of pi is negative one and cosine of two pi is back to one those are your originals now what would happen if you didn't have zero pi and two pi you'd get the same numbers here it's just it's just manipulating your how how um how much you're squishing that that period so you go okay the first point would give me one second point that's half a rotation gives me a negative or half a period and then the third one as a full rotation gives me back to whatever this is so we've completed that period so i'm going to take this and say if these are my key points and what i'm going to do is understand that i can multiply those outputs times negative 4. so cosine of some sort of input's going to give us an output that gets multiplied by negative four what's it going to do well it's going to stretch it and it's going to change the sign it's going to reflect it so take that and multiply your outputs not your inputs but your outputs so zero cool pi awesome two pi got it 1 times negative 4 and negative 1 times negative 4 and 1 times negative 4 give us a stretched and reflected output these are the points that you need to graph on top of that period so we're going to show that right now so let's plot it because we've used our appropriate inputs as related to our period we know that these should really be points on that graph so 0 negative 4 says i'm going to be right down here pi comma 4 i'm going to be right up here 2 pi comma negative 4 i'm going to be right down here if you can picture the original cosine function this is reflected and it's stretch i'm going to draw it for you in just a second it's kind of ugly but that's about how that graph should look now what would the original look like remember this scale is a little off because i'm really squishing this graph but the original cosine function looks about like that so here's the original cosine as it relates to a height of one and negative one look just like this nice smooth curve this is reflected and stretched out that's exactly how i would like you to graph these things are there other ways to do it yes but none that i've seen work as cohesively especially when you get to phase shifting phase shifting can really throw students for a loop and so i want to make sure that we're really good at this before we get there because this technique works really well especially with the key points that we have so what i'm going to do is give you a couple four or five more examples of increasing difficulty to the point where when we see sine and cosine at least we're really good at dealing with it then we'll transition to tangent and cotangent and deal with some of this and then finally secant and cosecant they're very awkward graphs then we will get into our phase shifting all right we're ready for another two so let's take a look at sine of three x and let's go through the process of graphing this thing just like those those steps talk about number one thing whenever you whenever you are doing this we are going to find the period of our trig function first no matter what so we might have to manipulate the argument of the trig function a little bit if we have some sort of a phase shift and i have to factor that but we don't hear we have no sort of a phase shift that would be added or subtracted inside the parentheses i'm trying to get you ready for that in many more videos from now let's start prefacing that in your head so we're going to take a look at this and go okay what are we seeing we're seeing sine and we're seeing the inside of our function we have 3x that 3 affects the period so in our heads we need to understand that sine has a period of 2 pi but we have to divide that by whatever that number is that coefficient over x that's going to start cutting or lengthening our period what's that do that's going to create this horizontal compression or horizontal stretch that's what happens here so this is a take your period sinus period of 2 pi cut it in 3. well that's just really shrunk this horizontally that's going to make it very narrow now i can show that as narrow as it should be but that period says you're going to have a period of 2 pi over 3. stop right there don't do anything else plot that on your x-axis so i've plotted two pi over three that's my period go through the same thing cut that in half so wait a minute what happens if you cut 2 pi over 3 in half 2 pi over 3 divided by 2 or cut in half is 2 pi over 6 or 2 pi over 3 times 2 those 2's cancel you're going to get pi over 3. now cut pi over three in half so you found period half your period now find the first quarter so pi over three divided by two cut in half is pi over six how you can always divide fractions by 2 is multiply their denominator so pi over 3 cut in half is pi over 3 times 2 that's pi over 6. now if you didn't catch it in last last example catch it here sometimes it's very difficult to find that for students um i've seen teachers tell them to average these two which you certainly can that's very difficult uh you can say hey power not vary but more difficult that has to be power 3 plus 2 pi over 3 divided by 2 is going to give you whatever that is but it's a little bit easier to think about hey if that's one quarter and that's a half of your period a quarter plus a half is three quarters that's what that is so just add those two it will give you whatever that quarter that third quarter is so pi over six plus pi over three use your calculator one sixth plus one third if you want to it doesn't matter but pi over six plus uh 2 pi over 6 that's pi over 3 is going to be 3 pi over 6 that's going to be pi over 2. so now that we've got our period all lined up we know exactly what the important points are for this graph we know that this is dealing with sine we know how sine looks we know specifically that sine has x-intercepts at the ends and at the center i hope right now you realize why we do the period first because everything revolves around that like literally uh everything revolves around it so if we have our period we know that sine has x-intercepts it ends in center we know exactly where our x-intercepts are that's that's very very nice um we also would have done a vertical shift now had we had it but we we don't so we've said period no vertical shift x sine says x-intercepts ends in center we got it the rest of the points the rest of these values the things that you don't have x-intercepts on become the x-coordinates of your key points so notice with your key points i know in the last video i had specific key points those change the idea was for sine your really important key points happen at the quarters whatever the quarter your periods are that's pi over 6 and pi over 2 right now those are the x-intercepts of your or x-coordinates of your key points now think back to what sine does sine has x-intercepts and ends in center it has peaks at the quarters first quarter is one second quarter is negative i'm sorry third quarter is negative one so i'm going to put that i'm going to put i know that sign has a 1 at its first quarter originally and negative 1 in its third quarter this is what we want to multiply by whatever's out front now we don't have anything right now but we will in just a while so we'd say these are our key points first quarter i'm not saying pi over six on perfect on purpose i'm not saying pi over six on purpose first quarter one third quarter negative one this is what you'd multiply times whatever's there in that case that's just one that's not gonna move it's not gonna stretch it not gonna reflect it so we're gonna plot those pi over six comma one or first quarter comma one third quarter negative one and we have a sine function that's been horizontally compressed if we shorten that period if we cut it up it's going to compress that sine function will happen more regularly i hope that makes sense to you i hope that you're seeing the utility and how i'm graphing these for you um one thing i do want to say before we get here is what would happen if instead of sine of 3x you had sine of negative 3x or you can think of this y equals cosine of negative 2x and you go i don't like that neither do i there is never a time when you should have a period with a negative in it wait wait a minute wouldn't you divide 2 pi by negative 3 well you would if you were kind of doing it wrong here's the deal because sine and cosine are odd and even functions you can always change the argument if it's negative into a positive by using the fact this is odd or even remember what odd functions do odd functions say opposite inputs opposite outputs what that means for sine because it's an odd function is that if you have sine of a negative inside of your your function you could write this as negative sine of 3x odd functions say opposite inputs opposite outputs that's odd and that's what this would do notice what you cannot do you cannot pull a negative three out you're not actually factoring a negative out get this man that's a big misconception for students you're not factoring out a negative here you're not just pulling it out you're using the fact it's an odd function you're using this that's what you're doing it's not magic it's not like well sine has a magic where you can pull out a negative but cosine no magic happens let's say you can't pull out a negative that's not it at all what it is is because sine is odd it follows this it says if you have a negative in the argument you can put a negative in front of your function and change the sign of your input that's what this is saying and that's why it works you're not pulling out a negative you certainly can't pull out a 3. what would it look like well would you still have the same period yes now that you've changed this to be more appropriate you have a period that's the same it looks just like that you have key points that are the same except that with this negative here's what would happen this negative negative one would now multiply your key points notice how that would work you'd have a key point of quarter comma one third quarter common negative one but you'd multiply those outputs and you'd get pi over six negative one and pi over two positive one first quarter output gets multiplied by negative one third quarter output gets multiplied by negative one and it's going to it's going to reflect that and so this graph would look like kind of pretty just a reflection that's what that would do please understand you cannot factor out anything inside of this in order to change this you need some sort of an identity so in order to change your argument you need some identities i haven't taught you yet and identities that they have one of them is that signs an odd function negatives can change the sign of your function along with the sign of your input now what would cosine do well cosine of negative 2x oh wait cosine is an even function don't be taken too high and dividing by negative 2. that's crazy we don't want a period of negative pi that that's awful right that's really hard to think about it's on the wrong side of the y-axis force we don't want to do that so think about how cosine is even well what do even functions do even functions due to a symmetry about the y-axis even functions say opposite inputs equal outputs what that means is that cosine of negative 2x is exactly the same as cosine of positive 2x now for a student who does not understand evenness this looks like magic it's like wait a minute why do you factor out the negative here but you don't there you're not factoring negative signs odd so opposite inputs give you opposite outputs that's what this is saying for cosine cosine's even opposite inputs give you the same output so in other words cosine of a positive angle or or opposite negative angle is giving you the same cosine we studied that a long time ago but this is how we deal with it so at this point we'd say okay now we're dealing with cosine of 2x let's talk about the period first period always takes the period of your trig function divides it by whatever your coefficient of your x is whatever's inside that parentheses in this case it's going to shrink it so our period is pi draw the pi so we put the period on our graph first we cut it in half we cut in half again for the first quarter this is going to make a lot of sense now what i was talking about here for the third quarter but for the third quarter hopefully you understand it's one-fourth two-fourths three-fourths and four-fourths but check it out you can always get this by adding these two one-fourth plus one-half is three-fourths or likewise pi over four plus pi over two is three pi over four that's the way i get the period every single time now understand what's going on here we don't have a vertical shift we show right now if we did there'd be plus or a minus here to shift this up or down we do not have that but what we do have are the fact that we have some some x-intercepts due to the fact that this is cosine cosine always has x-intercepts at the quarters so i'm going to put x-intercepts at the corners that i just found that's why we find that first cosine has key points wherever we don't have x-intercepts so on your period where you don't have an x-intercept at 0 pi over two and pi if you're starting to build something in your head you should be you should be thinking that hey sine is always going to have two key points and cosine's always going to have three that's true sine always has two x intercepts sorry three x intercepts and cosine always has two no the all because we have five key points all the time three of which are x intercepts and sine that gives us two peaks and peaks and then for cosine two which are x intercepts they give us three which are peaks so we're going to draw that so here's what we need to know about cosine you need to have a mental picture and understand that cosine has a peak at the first so so right before we even start has a peak when we start has a peak in the middle and it has a peak at the end and it goes one negative one and one originally so we're gonna write that down so where we start has a peak of one in the center has a peak of negative one maybe a valley at the end has a peak of one so notice i'm not doing i'm not just saying zero pi over two and pi i'm saying at the the first part of the the beginning of the end we have a peak of one and the center of peak of negative one or a value at negative one a local minimum then what we would do is we take a look at that and we'd see if we need to multiply it by anything because we don't have a change in amplitude we do not reflect this there's nothing there besides one we we don't multiply anything here if we had we multiply these outputs so we're going to go to our graph we're going to put these right on our graph the values are already there on our x-axis we should fill out our points so 0 1 pi over 2 negative 1. that's right in the center and then pi one that's at the end and we get a cosine graph this is just shortened this way and so this would repeat with more frequency is what we call that so this would go faster and faster and faster but can you see it's just a cosine function that's shrunk i hope it's making sense i'm going to start building this in difficulty we're going to talk about how to adjust both your period and amplitude in just a second uh we'll talk also about how to to put in a vertical shift there all right let's get after it so we've got a couple more how about y equals negative sine of wait x over eight that's weird that's like that's like 1 8. and you might see it written that way you might see y equals negative 2 sine 1 8 x or something like that that's fine here's what we're going to do we're going to find our period and vertical shift first we're going to graph those two things so here we see a a change in our period but not a vertical shift how we always deal with the period we talk about it first is take the original period whatever trig function you're dealing with in this case sine that's 2 pi divide by whatever is being multiplied by x keep in mind this fraction here is 1 8. you have to divide by 1 8 here so 2 pi divided by 1 8 is going to give you 16 pi remember you can multiply by the reciprocal and you're going to get 16 pi now i'm going to start having you think about something a little bit differently if we would have a vertical shift what we're going to do is is graph these in conjunction with one another so i don't have a vertical shift here but i do here and so here's what we would normally do we'd show our vertical shift and then we treat that like a new x-axis and we put our period on that so since i'm not shifting right now i'm going to put my period on my x-axis 16 pi this would be a really stretched out period so a really stretched out graph of sine let's find half of that that's really convenient let's find half of that in between here remember you can always add these two to find the third quarter that's 12 pi so we've gone ahead we've looked at our period we've looked at our vertical shift you typically deal with those in conjunction with one another i'm going to show you that on this example we've put our period down that's fantastic now we're going to take a look at what trig function we're dealing with we always do this in this order so got it and got it these go together at mark x intercepts so trig function is sine our x-intercepts are at the centers i'm sorry center and at the ends so center and ends for sine whatever is not an x-intercept is going to be a key point for you so i'm going to put 4 and 12 pi we need to have a mental picture of sign in our head we'd understand that for sine at the first quarter we're one and at the third quarter negative one you can see it on the unit circle first chord of the circle sine is one third quarter of the circle sine is negative one that is what this is referring to is just stretching this out a bit so one and negative one so we have found the period and the vertical shift we marked our x-intercepts we have our key points based on our quarters the things that aren't x-intercepts in this case and now we know that we have a norm normally we'd have a peak at 1 and negative 1. however our key points get affected by reflections and by vertical stretches and compressions so we're going to take whatever this is and multiply our outputs our key points outputs by that so two times negative one is negative two negative two times negative one is positive two so what this has done is it says taken and lengthened our period that's a vertical sorry a horizontal stretch this has taken our key points the outputs and made them change sign that's a reflection and grown them by a factor of two that's a stretch so this is a horizontal stretch that's the period it's a vertical reflection and a vertical stretch out of that that's what's happening here so because we know that because we know the first quarter we normally get one and at the third corner we normally get negative one for sine we're now multiplying by negative two and reflecting that and stretching it we just have to plot these now so four pi negative 2 12 pi positive 2 and we get this reflected sine function like we expected that's about how that would look um to get a real clear picture of what's what's actually going on please remember that the normal period for sine is two pi wait a minute that's like that's like right here so normally here's how this graph would look if you want to see it superimpose a little bit that's about how that would look so this has been i moved out a little bit more right there but this has been really stretched out and quite a bit uh vertically stretched as well so that's the original sine function and then this is the reflected stretch horizontally and stretched vertically sine function i hope it's making sense i hope you've seen the interaction of the key points especially in this graph it's it's quite important okay let's move on to y equals 3 times cosine of 4x plus 1. the first thing we do with any trig function is figure out the period yes but we also want to consider any vertical shifts i'm going to show you how that works here so our period says look at your trig function it's cosine cosine has normally a period of two pi but now we're dividing that by four so that's going to be pi over two this also has a vertical shift right there think about what would happen you plug in a number find cosine of the number that's an output three times that that's an output and then you add one where you're adding one not to the input you're adding one to the output so this is going to affect the output here this is a vertical shift up one so there's a slight change in what we're going to do instead of just putting our period on our x-axis here's the thought if we're going to shift this up one let's sort of pretend the x-axis shifts up one so we're going to make a dotted line a horizontal dotted line right here and we're going to put our period on that dotted line you can put it in both places if you'd like but it really helps to put it on your shifted axis now is the x-axis really moving no not really but we're going to use that as a graphic organizer on what on which to put our key points it's how the key points work is on the shifted versions of your axes so i'm going to draw that horizontal line what that represents is our entire function is shifting up one unit every output at every point shifting up one unit what we're going to do is graph our period on that so we're going to do that right now you can also put it on your x-axis i just find it very very helpful to put on this this line especially when it's way above or way below so pi over two is our period half of that's pi over four half of that's pi over eight if i add those two things together let's see pi over eight plus two pi over eight that's three pi over eight now this is key when we talk about cosine having x-intercepts at the quarters keep in mind what we're doing because we shifted this up one this is why we draw this dotted line this is why i'm putting the period on that dotted line i know it's not really there i know that x-axis is right here and that's totally fine but because i've done that i now know that not only does this function shift but the x-axis the x-intercepts also shift and so we can plot our x-intercepts at the quarters but they've got to be in relation to where you just shifted what that means is that our x-intercepts are not really x-intercepts anymore what they are are places where we would now intersect this horizontal line at y equals one so that's at the quarter so remember cosine x intercepts at quarters what that means is cosine where we would have some key points here are as it are at pi over eight one three pi over eight one we're sort of pretending it's an x-axis and we'd get two very important key points here no they're not x-intercepts anymore hopefully that makes sense you don't just magically move your x-axis it's just a graphic organizer for you to create a very good-looking graph with middle work but those points would be pi over eight one and three pi over eight one we're treating them like x intercepts because we're shifting everything else so the ends in the center become your key point so i'm gonna put down zero here's zero and so x equals zero and pi over four and pi over two we also need to understand what cosine does cosine has peaks of one at the ends and negative one in the center those are our key points as it would relate to a cosine that's been sort of squished to a quarter of the normal period now we're going to say hey those things can be multiplied by whatever numbers here that factor out in front multiplies your outputs so allow it to do so so three times all of these outputs so we get 0 3 and we get negative 1 times 3 here we get 1 times 3 here so pi over 4 negative 3 pi over 2 comma 3. those are our new key points we're going to plot them in relation to our shifted x-axis so there's a lot going on here here's what we've done we've taken a look and said hey our period has shrunk that's a horizontal compression we've shifted up one that's a vertical shift of one so that's acts like our x-axis we've recognized that for cosine x-intercepts are at the quarters so they it acts like x-intercepts on that shifted version we said all right our key points will happen at ends and center for cosine we've written them down we know that peaks are at the beginning end and the a positive one and negative one in the center we turn that down we've adjusted with a vertical stretch here so we've had a horizontal compression a vertical shift and a vertical shift stretch of three and then we've shown that now we're going to plot these key points but please get this is the biggest deal because you shifted that these key points relate to this as acting as your x-axis it's not i know it's not really there but it acts like it and so we plot these points in relation to this thing right here what that means is that 0 3 this would act like 0 0. i know it's not there but it acts like it this would be 0 1 2 3. this would be acting like 0 3. if you've seen my previous graphene that makes sense look i know that point's actually 0 4. like everybody realizes that this is just a very good way to get an accurate graph without having to plug in a ton of points it's the best way i've come up to deal with it so that students actually understand what they're doing how about pi over 4 negative 3. here's pi over 4. we're going to treat this like the place from where you are putting your key points so pi over four comma negative three is one two three right here pi over two comma three this acts like your x axis so pi over two comma three is right about there can you see that it's a cosine that's been shifted shrunk this way grown this way for the last time yes everybody realizes that you don't actually have x-intercepts here and here it's just a it's just a graphic organizer to help you graph it um i hope i've made the point that your key point i know i have but that your key points are in relation to where you shift to both up and down and when we get to phase shifting left and right as well that's why we do these in a certain order so period yes but a vertical shift and next i have several minutes now and a horizontal shift they all work together so you put your period after you have done your shifting put them on that new x-axis that you the new x-axis that you have so i hope that makes sense we're going to come back with like two more maybe a special case we'll be done okay kind of some awkward ones they look a little weird like wait a minute what's that doing in there how are we gonna have pies and something that you plug in pies too it's actually gonna be a little bit easier but you have to see it a couple times so i'm gonna walk you through this one i'm gonna go very quickly through this one you need to do this on your phone so let's take a look at our 4 sine pi over 2x minus 2 the first thing i really need to understand is there is an extreme difference whether this parentheses ends here or here if you have something added or subtracted outside of your function that's a vertical shift up or down where minus means down if this had been inside your parentheses where this wasn't here you would have to factor out a pi over 2 and that would become what's called a phase shift left and right oh you should remember that you should remember that anything added or subtracted inside your function is left or right but it has to be in a certain form and it's opposite of what you want it to be do you remember that i hope you remember that i hope that you remember that subtracting is to the right and adding is to the left inside of a function as far as our horizontal shifts and therefore phase shifts are concerned so let's get back to it there's a few things going on we need to really understand the first one is the period the period always says take your the period of your original treat function or the original period of a trig function 2 pi and divide it by whatever coefficient is in front of your x wait a minute 2 pi divided by uh pi over 2 well the pi's are going to cancel and we would get well if we reciprocate and multiply we get 2 pi times two over pi the twos give you four the pi's cancel you're going to get four here wait a minute can you have a period of four yeah it's actually a little bit easier to deal with just put four on your graph now we're not going to do it now though because we also have a vertical shift so that minus 2 says you are going to shift down 2. and so we're going to show that we're going to put these together in general we show our vertical shift and horizontal shift phase shift first and put our period in relationship to the new shifted axis so we've done our vertical shift of down two we know our period is four so let's go ahead and put the period on our i'm gonna put on the x-axis but i'm gonna show all of our marks on my shifted axis if we do this to scale here's two that'd be about four half of that's two a quarter that's one and three quarters is three that's kind of nice 1 2 and 3. so we've gone ahead and we've done our vertical shift we've done our period we now know that we're dealing with sine and so sine has x-intercepts at the end and center what that refers to now because we shifted this is our x-intercepts change to just some key points that interact with that shifted version of our x-axis ends and center that leaves us with two key points based on our quarters one and three remember what sine does sine originally peaks at the first quarter at one end of the third quarter negative one this is why it was so important for you to remember that yes those key points on the original sine function are great but the way they refer to as first quarter and third quarter peak at one peak at negative or valley i suppose at negative one that's what we have here first quarter positive one third quarter negative one then we allow this to infect our outputs so what this has done this has taken and grown our period actually because of sorry shorter period because the period was originally two pi this is smaller than that this is smaller than two times pi this is four so it's horizontally compressed us this has shifted us down to this is going to vertically stretch us so we have our our key points 1 1 yes but now 1 comma 4 times 1 is 4. and likewise three comma negative four plot these in relation to your shifted axis and your quarters that you put down so one comma four starts from here one comma four would be one comma one two three four three comma negative four would be three comma one two three four and we get a sine or sinusoidal function out of this thing what if you had to keep going could you do this for another cycle or another period all we would do is double this so double this period you get eight add whatever this number is to each of these things and you will get the filled in version of that so 1 plus 4 is 5 that's the it's called the next first quarter 2 plus 4 is 6 that's in the center 3 plus 4 is 7 and you would get another ability to put down your x-intercepts at the ends in the center your key points will just shift over so remember this is why we talk about first quarter being one or first quarter being four third quarter being negative four so that you can just move it so now here's your first quarter first score is five so five comma four one two three four third quarter negative four that's one two three four and we get another psychology you keep going forever and ever and ever like that again this is the last time i'm gonna say this probably not but the last time i say this is yes the key points are not actually one one four is not on your graph all right one comma two is on your graph it's just plotted in relation to your shifted axis so that you can do it so that it's easy you're not plugging in points all the time i hope the technique makes sense i hope that you're understanding it i hope that you like it i've seen it work very very well when the student understands it then it's they never make mistakes on it for very rarely okay i told you i was going to go quickly through it i'm going to we have cosine here cosine has a period of 2 pi if we divide by pi over 4 then that's going to give us a period of 8. now we're going to graph that in just a bit that period but we're also identifying that that is up 2. so i'm going to take and i'm going to make a vertical shift up 2. now because we've done that we can put our period of eight notice reciprocate multiply you're gonna get eight put our period of eight on our x-axis and the shifted version now cut it in half cut it in half again that's our first quarter add these two that's your third quarter so remember what cosine does cosine peaks at the first quarter i'm sorry at the beginning and at the end and it right in the middle so at the zero if you will at the halfway point and at the end one's at the beginning end negative one in the center has x-intercept at the corners so x-intercepts now shift what that leaves us with are three key points zero four and eight the centers and the ends we also remember with cosine that originally before we start shifting it before we start manipulating before we start vertically stretching and reflecting it that those ends would have a 1 and the center would have a value of negative 1. those however get get changed they get transformed by that number that number that output that factor affects the outputs of your of your function so it's going to take those outputs it's going to multiply by negative three so we've seen affect the period got it shipped up to got it drawn them together after that we have our key points if it's at the center and at the ends for cosine no problem with x-intercepts at the quarters we got that that's what cosine does you need to remember that because we know that the ends in the center have a peak of 1 and 1 and negative 1 respectively this is a multiplier that factor multiplies the outputs it grows and reflects things and so we've done that as long as we plot these key points from our shifted version on our period we're gonna be fine so this says where you begin and notice i'm not saying just zero just where you begin that's gonna affect be affected on a phase shift where you begin is at zero negative three so here's zero one two three four comma three that's the center and then three here's the center of the period comma three and here's eight negative three that's the end of the period negative three obviously the point on the graph is not eight negative three it's eight negative 1 but that's because we shifted up 2 units the point here is to use it in relationship and you're going to get a very nice graph so what's happened here we have let's see stretched out our period so horizontal stretch we've shifted up two so vertical stretch of two we have reflected this you can see it's not like this it's like this now and we've vertically stretched it that's four transformations and that's one period worth of this particular cosine function man i hope i'm making it make sense i hope that at this point like yes i get this please stop with the examples well i'm not gonna i'm gonna give you one more going in reverse and then we're going to be done with it okay so what if you have to go backwards what if you have to create a function from an amplitude or a period or even from a graph of a function we'll talk about that i'm not going to do one for you they're not as super common but i will talk about how to do that so if you have a period could you write a function from it if you have an amplitude could you give it a number up front now notice those won't give you reflection but you could talk about it as far as the period goes we know that if the period is the period of your original function so you need to know whether you're getting a sine or a cosine out of it this in this case we want a sine we need to know what our original period is and that is divided by whatever your omega is so wait a second if you have a period of four pi then what this translates to is 4 pi hey that's our period equals this is what our period always is so if you have 4 pi equal to 2 pi over omega can you solve for omega yeah we'd multiply both sides by omega and divide by 4 pi ultimately what you do just interchange these two things that's going to give you omega equals 2 pi over 4 pi again you can multiply both sides by omega divided by four pi whatever you want this is going to give you one half in conjunction with what we know our amplitude to be our amplitude is the absolute value of whatever our a is so if we don't know whether we have a reflected graph or not just consider it to be your a and we can get a function from an amplitude and from whatever our period is and that's about it we just put our omega right there in front of your action you're done now a weird question what if your what if your t wasn't 4 pi what if it was just 2 or something well we can do the same thing we just understand that if we take our original our original period for our trig function write the formula period is always pi over 2 divided by omega and that's the number in front of x so if we know that t is 2 then we can solve for omega and omega would be pi so we just change this to pi and we get sine of pi times x now with the same amplitude we would get that exact same function i hope that makes sense to you on at least how to find a whatever the argument of your sign that your trig function is from whatever your period is we can do other things and let this on the board for you just to say hey could you recognize that this is shifted up two units could you recognize that this is a reflected graph can you recognize that if we start and stop from zero to eight that you would have a t of eight you can find your omega this is a little bit more advanced but it is something that you can do now that we understand how to graph from our trig functions this should be doable to go backwards i i want you to do that sort of on your own i've already shown you one example you can get the same information from a graph so i just wanted to mention that i hope that this video has made sense i hope that especially you understand how to relate your trig function and your period with your shifting and then get your x-intercepts appropriate ends and center for sine quarters for cosine use the rest of what's not filled out so rest of it aren't your x-intercepts to get key points and then plot them in relation to your shifted axis hope that makes sense i'll see you for another video when you start talking about what tangent looks like have a great day you
