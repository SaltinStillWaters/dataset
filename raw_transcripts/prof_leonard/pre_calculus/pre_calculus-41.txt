Transcript for: Finding an Oblique Asymptote of a Rational Function (Precalculus - College Algebra 41)
hey there now that we have a good feeling for what a horizontal asymptote is and why it happens how they work we're going to talk about what's called an oblique asymptote sometimes called a slant asymptote due to the fact that it's a diagonal line now we're also going to talk about this so plea please have a couple of these things in your head as we go through number one you you really got to know what a horizontal asymptote is and when you get them um this video the last video and the next video are all dealing with what is called end behavior of a rational function and there's really only three cases you have a horizontal asymptote either at zero or a constant you have a diagonal line asymptotes called an oblique or a slant or you have just regular old end behavior we're going to model that so we're kind of in the second second phase of this so when we talk about an oblique asymptote of a rational function there's a few things i want you to know one was i just told you the second thing is you're going to have to know how to do long division of polynomials not just synthetic division so if you ignored me when i showed all that stuff it's time to go back and rewatch that because you can't do this with synthetic division you have to have long division which is why i taught it to you most of the times we did i did both when possible so here's when you're going to have an oblique asymptote and we talked about end behavior last video we understand hopefully that a horizontal asymptote happens horizontal asymptote happens when the degree of the denominator is larger than the numerator that's y equals zero x-axis or equal to the numerator that's going to be a constant the leading coefficients will tell you that so what happens when the numerator starts being larger so notice horizontal asymptote takes care of all the cases where the denominator is equal to or greater than the numerator the oblique asymptote and end behavior take care of the cases where the numerator is bigger than the denominator as far as degree if they're equal remember if they're equal you get a horizontal asymptote at a constant that's not zero if the numerator starts being larger we really only have two cases the first one is the oblique asymptote and the next one would be just straight up end behavior so what happens when the degree of the numerator is exactly one more so degree of numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator by exactly one this is when you're going to get an oblique asymptote an oblique asymptote is a diagonal line that your function is going to approach so as x gets positive infinity maybe you have diagonal lines just like y equals x or something as x is positive infinity this function is going to get closer to a diagonal line and as x approaches negative infinity it's getting closer to a diagonal line it's going to follow that diagonal line for infinity and beyond so that that's what an oblique asymptote does it's very much like a horizontal it's just it's just a diagonal line the same thing why that is think about this for a second before we get into it if the degree of the numerator is larger by one then what we're going to have by our leading terms you'd have something two power functions that you could simplify and you'd end with like three x to the first power three x to the first power is a line has a slope of three we also have one more step long division but that's why this is happening is because the degree of the numerator is larger by one you divide you get a line and that's going to model the end behavior of this function that's why it happens a couple notes i mentioned a couple of number one we really have to know long division of polynomials i'm only doing one example in this video because we'll be practicing it later on i'm just going to show you how to do that one time but we've already talked about long division polynomials also you might hear this called a slant asymptote from time to time that's informal the formula is oblique asymptote that's what i'm going to be using but you might hear it called a slant or a diagonal asymptote because it is just a diagonal line horizontal was already taken care of now we're on diagonal so let's go ahead oh yeah last one kind of covering it up i make a better door than a window i guess um you can't have both a horizontal and an oblique now think about just the degrees for a second and that's going to make sense to you if your degrees are equal you have horizontal if degree of denominator is bigger you have horizontal at y equals zero if the degree of the numerator is larger by one you have oblique you can't have both a numerator that's has a larger degree than a denominator and at the same time have equal or denominator larger that that's impossible so you went to a contradiction therefore you cannot have both a horizontal and an oblique it is one or the other or none and then you just have end behavior so you fall into one of three cases here horizontal constant or zero oblique diagonal line or just straight up and behavior you're not going to have all of them you have just one of them and it's based on the degree so it's based on end behavior so let's take a look at it we do something different with an oblique asymptote than we do with other end behaviors you see normally we take a look at this and go all right well what's going to happen our end behavior is going to be modeled by our leading terms we studied this in the last video and because leading terms are always power functions the variables will always simplify see all right well yeah this is going to give us just simply 3x well well what what is that what happens as x approaches infinity oh as x approaches infinity positive infinity our function approaches let's see plug in big numbers here uh three times really big positive numbers are really big positive numbers this also approaches positive infinity okay as x approaches negative infinity what's our function doing we're doing limits by the way this is a the introduction to sort of what limits do what happens is x gets really big negatively well three times really large negative numbers i know it's kind of backwards but we're going to use them that that terminology for now as x gets really big absolute value negative numbers well this is going to get to negative infinity three times really big negative numbers are really really big negative numbers that's going to be negative infinity and it will follow this line with a slope of 3. remember 3x has a slope of 3 power 1 would be a diagonal line that's exactly what this function is going to follow however there's one more step we have to do to get the the actual line you see this is this has the slope right this is three that's great but we're missing a y-intercept so you can't draw this diagonal line without knowing the y-intercept the y-intercept comes from doing long division so long story made short this is still end behavior it's obviously not a horizontal asymptote because as x approaches infinity our function is not getting close to zero it's not getting close to a constant it's getting close to infinity and negative infinity just going to happen along the diagonal line so we're going to look at how to deal with that dagger line so this all comes from our our long division of polynomials if you do notice this makes sense by the way if you look at our degree the degree here is 4 the degree here is 3 4 is exactly 1 more than 3. if you have a question right now because i know it pops into my head what if this were 5 well then you'd get x squared x squared is not a diagonal line x squared is a parabola that's going to be our next video on end behavior so we'll deal with that this is only the case when our degree on the numerator is larger by one what if this was three well then you get just three oh wait that's a horizontal asymptote at y equals three that's the last video right now again we're just dealing with one degree here is one more than that one that's why i'm only doing one example because there's really only one thing that we do with this now what we do with it is we take and we're just going to divide it so we take our look at our numerator that's three x to the fourth minus x squared long division polynomials needs like kind of like a place value for all of your missing exponents of x so we're going to start with three x to the fourth we don't have any x cubes but we need a place for it just like we need a place for the zero x and the zero because there's no constant as well we actually could factor the numerator but that's not the point of what we're doing here we're trying to figure out what our oblique asymptote is going to look like what the the function is of that asymptote now on our denominator this is what we're dividing by if you remember long division of polynomials works just with your leading terms and here's something else i'm going to tell you while this looks really crazy i know it's intimidating to go oh my gosh this is going to take absolutely forever it's not please please listen but man rewind the video and pause it or be happy just really focus here here's what you're trying to get what you're trying to get is y equals m x plus b so we only need to do this exactly two times you're going to divide your first term by your first term and you're going to get 3x you'll distribute subtract and divide your first term by your first term and then you are done i'll show you exactly where to stop you need to go no further at all so don't worry about it you're not i don't care what the remainder is i do not care all we're trying to get to is what the mx plus b form or the slope intercept form of our oblique asymptote is so it's just two iterations of long division it's not that hard so we're going to take our first term so 3x to the fourth divide by x cubed and you're going to get 3x let me ask you a question and see if you're thinking are you always in this case are you always going to get constant x to the first power constant x to the oh well constant coefficient x to the first power in other words are you always going to get a power one for your first term here yes because you would not be doing this unless this degree was exactly one more than that one if this degree is exactly one more than that one every single time you divide long division for an oblique asymptote every time this will be one more than this and you will get something to the first power there every time that's why if the degree is one larger you're going to get no bleed asymptote for sure because if this is one larger than that when you divide it you'll get a power one and a power one is always a diagonal line hey that needs to make sense so are you always going to get something the x to the first power here yes you are otherwise you shouldn't be doing this because oblique asymptotes only happen if the degree of the numerator is larger by one than the denominator and if that's not the case you have horizontal or other end behavior you don't even have to do this so yes now we're going to distribute so we don't have an x to the oh sorry we do have an x to the third good thing we put that there and then we have we don't have an x squared we have a 3x so i'm going to double check this 3x times x to the third is 3x to the fourth that looks good 3x times negative x squared is negative 3x to the third got that 3x times 1 is 3x not x squared so i'm leaving that as a 0x squared when we subtract what we're going to get is remember that when we subtract we're subtracting term by term so 3x to the fourth minus 3x support that's zero that's what we want to happen but zero x to the third minus a negative that's adding you're subtracting a negative that's three x to the third honestly i don't even care about this it does not matter it doesn't make a difference because here's what we're in if you want to you know what i just really want to be complete so minus x squared and minus 3x yeah great but it doesn't matter all we are looking for is this next term that's it i promise you that's all that matters so when you take a look at 3x to the third you really don't need this you go okay here's my first term remember long division polynomials works first term divided by first term 3x to the third divided by x to the third that will simplify and that will give you positive three you're done don't distribute don't subtract this is irrelevant all you're looking for is this right here so our oblique asymptote our oblique asymptote is y equals three x plus three here's what that means if i were to graph three x plus three it's a y intercept of zero three that's a slope of three over one so about three over one that's about like that our graph our function right here is going to follow that as we get toward x equals positive negative infinity it's going to look like a diagonal line so most of the time this is going to have a at least one vertical asymptote so also going to cross the x-axis so what we're going to get right here is we're going to get sort of a look like probably i can't even do it with my hands like this it's going to it's going to kind of come up and then do this at the end behavior so it's going to follow that diagonal line as we get way out there to be doing this that's what's going to happen so we know this line that way we can put it on our graph and we say oh yeah my function is going to follow that now here's another point that i wanted to make and did it with horizontal asymptotes um can you cross an oblique asymptote yes you can it's not a vertical asymptote it acts kind of like a horizontal flipped on it's it kind of tilted a little bit slanted a little bit so yeah you can you can cross it as many times as the function allows but at the end behavior it's going to be following that so that's why we wanted to graph this so that we know what our function looks like as we go toward the ends of our our x-axis positive and negative infinity and that's exactly how we do it so long story hopefully shorter is uh take a look if this is bigger than this by exactly one you know you're going to get an oblique asymptote but you have to do long division it's only two steps first term divided by first term distribute subtract and first term divide by first term and then you're done don't even distribute don't need to subtract this is your oblique asymptote so i hope that makes sense we're going to come back do another video on end behavior just end behavior when oblique and horizontal asymptotes are out of the picture and then we're going to start um practicing for one video and then we'll do some some graphing all right hope you having fun you
