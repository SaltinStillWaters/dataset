Transcript for: The Graphs of Sine and Cosine (Precalculus - Trigonometry 11)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about the graphs of sine and cosine we're going to spend quite a bit of time on it and the reason is because there's a little little bit of a problem that some students have going from hey the argument or the inside of your sine and cosine is theta into the arguments now x and they confuse it with x here so we're going to talk about that we'll talk about where the graphs come from why they look the way they do paying special attention to the period of sine and cosine because we're going to be graphing those in the next video with these things called transformations how we adjust the period the amplitude and things like that we'll also talk about what key points are for sine and cosine if you've watched some of my previous videos on college algebra things like that i'm going to show you exactly the same way on how to use that technique of shifting so up down left right stretch compress both horizontally and vertically so with the period and the amplitude for sine and cosine and that's going to make a lot more sense when we get there so that's what we're going to teach in this video what the graphs look like in the next video how to use them so how to use your key points in relation to amplitude and period to get a very solid graph with minimal work so let's get right to it what we're going to talk about in graphing sine and cosine is how would we put a graph of these functions on an x and y axis now this is what i was prefacing just a minute ago with some students have a real big problem translating what the unit circle is into this because of that right there and here's the idea when we talk about a function of x in terms of sine of x i need you to realize that that x relates to either the angle or the arc length on a unit circle and they're one and the same because we're measuring in radians right now we can see that these are all in terms of radians which is why it was so important for us to be able to deal with that the reason again behind that is because sine and cosine can be defined we talked about this a long time ago in terms of their angular movement so sweeping up that angle or the arc length which means we can plug in any real number talk about domain in a second any real number to both sine and cosine and that's what we're going to do so there's there's a bit of a switch right here where we say yeah you know what we can think of this in terms of an angle that's totally fine we can also think of this in terms of a real number so there's a translation i need you to make from the unit circle to our graphs we're going to be getting some of these outputs and putting them on our graph but please keep in mind this x does not have to do with this x that doesn't have to do with it this x is the output of cosine of some sort of an angle or some sort of an arc length and that's how i need you to think of this i need to think of that this is the angle or the arc length they're one and the same when we're talking about radians remember that that one radian is where the angle equals the arc length which equals sorry the radius is the point where the arc length equals the radius and we consider them to be one and the same in that because of the formulas we developed a long time ago so the long story made short is that relates to the angle that x is not this x that would be cosine so we're going to go right now and we're going to try to see what some of these outputs are so if we take a look at this you're going to see some really common numbers um in terms of our unit circle like pi over 6 pi over 2 5 pi over 6 pi 7 pi over 6 3 pi over 2 11 pi over 6 and 2 pi some different ones down here why because what i'm going to do right now is i'm going to take our angles notice how that relates to the angle this is our x axis x is our angle remember our trig functions have to deal with an angle relating an angle to something on our unit circle an x or y sine happens to rep to relate the angle to the y coordinate of a point here or the opposite over the hypotenuse on triangle which we can get the same thing here so we're going to take a look at our angle and write down the sine of that particular angle so let's start right now i'm going to start with well i'm going to start with zero so i want to take a look at what happens if we have an angle of zero our sine of zero is zero so notice what we're doing that x something on this x-axis is a real number that's true but it also relates to an angle on your unit circle so i'm looking up sine of that particular angle sine of zero is zero so i'm looking at my angle and taking my y-coordinate for the angle again x-axis here represents the angle on the unit circle sine of that angle is what we're getting in blue around that so sine of zero is zero what that means is that this sine function passes through the origin now i'm going to jump a bit i'm going to jump to pi let's talk about pi what would pi be well sine of pi here remember this our x-axis pi would be an angle so or a real number here sine of pi says go over here go to an angle of pi sine of pi is the y coordinate so sine of pi is zero so that means that this function is going to be zero at a degree of a rating of zero also at pi now where's it going to hit 0 again this right here is going to start giving us our our period and the look of our graph so remember this do you remember how sine repeats every 2 pi so 0 0 and then back to 0. so if i went sine of 0 i'm getting 0. sine of pi i'm getting 0. sine of 2 pi i'm also going to get 0. think about that 2 pi's right here my angle would be 2 pi my output of that angle for sine is zero so i'm gonna hit zero again now quick question before we go any further could you keep going could you do sine of zero and sine of pi sine of two pi sine of 3 pi 7 4 pi yes how about negative pi yes this doesn't terminate here this is a curve that goes forever and ever and ever in fact you can plug in any real numbers here there is not going to be an issue with sine we recognize that that you can plug in any angle forever as many times you want to go around this and you'll always get one of these outputs or something between them there's never an issue with sine of not being able to plug in an angle or something on our x-axis which represents a real number or we can think of it as an angle what that means is that for our domain our domain for sine is going to be all real numbers we can plug in anything to sign i'm going to abbreviate all real numbers you can also write it negative infinity to infinity on the x-axis that's totally fine now let's jump and do the pi over two so i did zero sine of zero zero sine of pi is zero sine of two pi is zero how about sine of pi over two well let's go back here so sine of pi over two remember x axis is representing a real number but it also represents an angle for our sign on the unit circle so sine of pi over 2 says i'm going to take the y coordinate remember that our inputs here sine of x our x is our angle or arc length on the unit circle and we would get sine of pi over 2 is 1. let's go another pie past that pie pass that what do you mean half a circle past that so sine of 3 pi over two so here our input would be three pi over two sine of three pi over two is negative one sine of three pi over two so i plugged in three pi over two sine of three pi over two is negative one now i also have some awkward ones like pi over 6 why'd i pick that well because sine of pi over 6 is going to be one half and that's really easy to graph sine of pi over 3 would not be that'd be square root of 3 over 2 and that's a little bit harder to graph and so i'm picking some nice values to give us a good shape here so let's take a look at that now we're going to have at pi over 6 and remember x-axis is our inputs sine of our input represents sine of an arc length or an angle on our unit circle so sine of pi over 6 says i'm going to have one half input is the angle sine of that angle is that blue number so one half the same thing happens with sine of five pi over six we also get one half now how about sine of seven pi over six so i've done zero pi over six pi over two five pi over six and pi i've done them in a special order so you see a couple relationships that would really hammer home in a second now we're going to get to 7 pi over 6. remember that these are in quadrants 3 and 4. sine is negative in those quadrants sine was positive make this connection sine was positive everywhere until we got to here the y values are positive so sine is positive until we got to there sine is positive until we get to pi look at the graph it's all positive now it's going to be all negative and in fact sine of 7 pi over 6. that's our x input that sine of 7 pi over 6 represents sine of some angle here that's going to be negative one half and sine of 11 pi over 6 well let's see sine of 11 pi over 6 would be negative one half as well sine is negative in those two quadrants and therefore is negative in the last half of our period we're going to talk about the period in a second let's recap just a minute here's the things that i need you to notice about sign firstly where it comes from and if you get it you're going to be head and shoulders around above most people who are in calculus actually because a lot of people do not understand where this comes from and how it relates to this so if you get that you're doing awesome here's how it relates again remember our x-axis is a real number line it has real numbers on it forever when we start taking sine of those real numbers because that real number can be represented as an arc length on a unit circle not any circle a unit circle because it can be represented on an arc like the unit circle and also represent the angle that the arc length sweeps out due to the fact that we have a unit circle and that we represent arc length as r times theta where r is one arc length equals angle so x-axis gives you some sort of an arc length that also represents an angle on a unit circle because it's a unit circle and so it says hey that's our input so sine of that can be found by sine of whatever angle you are taking a look at in terms of radians only because that's the only way that formula actually worked that was in some previous videos so we're making this connection going yeah i can plug this into a unit circle because of that fact keeping in mind that this x represents our length therefore angle and not an x coordinate on a unit circle x coordinates here are angles here because of the arc length idea on a unit circle and then we went and found all of our our y outputs sine of our angles gave us our y coordinates we put those on there and we're noticing the quadrants about it man i hope that you see it if sine is positive in the first two quadrants then sine is positive in the first half of the period what's a period a period is where our trig functions repeat themselves so this is going to repeat every 2 pi now that needs to make sense because our sign repeated every time we made a full rotation if i go to one half it's going to repeat on a full rotation all of those y values will do that on a full rotation and so our period is going to be 2 pi we got to look for the same there's a few key features i need to notice that we have a 0 at 0 pi and two pi i'm going to make sure that i represent that here by sine crosses the x-axis at the ends and center of your period where's its peak it peaks at the quarters of your period high and low and so we get this very nice smooth curve out of it and it doesn't end it oscillates back and forth it repeats on every two pi interval and so there's a lot of things we can say number one we said our domains all real numbers you can plug in anything on this x-axis forever ultimately you're just going to repeat yourself on this unit circle over and over again what's this range though well if sine represents the y coordinate the highest y you can get is one and the lowest y you can get is negative one and that's exactly what we see here the highest y value output here remember that the y here doesn't necessarily correlate to the y axis here it represents the output of sine well the output of sine can be a maximum of one and a minimum of negative one so our range is between negative one and one and that's inclusive because we do have points of pi over two comma one and three pi over two comma negative one those are points on the graph so we include that now how about even or odd well even functions mean symmetric about the y axis this is not even odd functions being symmetric about the origin so could you rotate this 180 degrees and get the same picture you could yes exactly so this is an odd function we learned about that as far as sine and cosine we got an identity i think a video or two ago when we talked about that now the period i've been man i've been prefacing this a long time we finally see a picture of it here that every time you make a full rotation you start repeating repeating that full rotation is 2 pi radians so our period for sine and also for cosine is going to be 2 pi it's not for tangent so for tangent and cotangent we're going to get just pi we saw that we're going to see it graphically as well every pi it repeats now the important parts for our graphing i need i really need you to get these following things i needed you to understand the period but we talked about it let's talk about x-intercepts we're going to talk about key points and where sine crosses x-axis and where it peaks so our x-intercepts our x-intercepts happen every get this k times pi now i've seen that a couple times that i want to make sure you understand it k pi means every multiple where k is an integer positive or negative times pi you are going to get an x intercept let's check it out at zero zero times pi is zero you're going to get x intercept 1 times pi is pi you can get x intercept 2 times pi is 2 pi you're going to get x intercept and 3 pi and at 4 pi and at negative pi and at negative 2 pi that is where x intercepts happen why because every half of a circle you are going to get zero for your y coordinate that makes sense the y coordinate here here's your y axis the y coordinate here is zero it's also zero here and here and here and here and it's here every time you go half a circle from your zero you're going to get a zero for y an x intercept a zero for your output that's what that says it looks a little awkward but it should make sense that you're just going half a circle on your unit circle and you're going to be repeating that starting from zero hopefully that makes sense to you so we get x intercepts every k times pi one times by 2 times 0 times pi negative 1 times 5 and so forth so where sine crosses the x axis let's look let's look at this in terms of the period where does it cross if our period is 2 pi our sine function crosses the x x-axis at the ends of the period and the center here's why i want you to remember that you see when we start talking about shifting phase shifting transformations up down left right stretch compress all these things especially with the period we're going to have some very awkward points and so i'm going to give you key points but i'm not going to give them to you in terms of remembering these numbers because your period is going to change due to a horizontal stretch of compression it's going to change what i need you to remember this is key is that sign is always no matter what your period  changes to compresses or or stretches you no matter what that hap what this changes to your sign will always cross not bounce across at the ends and center of whatever period you have so here's what's going to happen when we start altering our period in the next video we're going to take a look at what our period is we're going to say oh this is sine our period is this okay how do i change it divide or multiply i have my new period you know what we're going to do we're going to go to the ends of that period and put x-intercepts and the center and put an x-intercept and that's going to be half the battle on how to graph these trig functions stick with this way it's very similar to the other graphing techniques and transformations i gave you and it's why i gave you that technique so right here i need you to really really remember that sine crosses the x-axis at the ends and center of period where's it peak it peaks at let's see this is one two three four it peaks at the quarters so here's half here's a quarter so how do we write our peaks so in the future when we get to graphing sine and cosine you're going to take a look at your period you're going to for put x-intercepts at the end and the center and you're going to use your quarters as your only two key points that matter because your amplitude this number in front if there was a number right there it would affect your key points it's very similar to the graphing i've taught you already that if you affect your key points well you multiply by whatever that number is it has the ability to stretch it to compress it and to reflect it and it's based on where our peaks occur local max local men those happen at the quarters so pi over two and three pi over two for this period but if i adjust that period i need to remember that our peaks happen at the quarters right now this is a lot of a lot of theory behind it i'm showing you all this and we're not doing any examples to get this built in so the next video we can just run with it so this is a big deal i'm going to go through cosine a lot quicker because if you know the idea now what we're learning is that sine and cosine both are going to repeat themselves every two pi that's going to be the period the domain is all real numbers you plug in anything just depends on how many times you want to go around that unit circle or where you want to stop there's going to be an output for that our range is negative 1 to 1. neither of these things get bigger or smaller than negative 1 and negative 1 respectively we have an odd function we're going to get an even function here but the key ideas are that sine for sine has x-intercepts at the center and the ends and peaks at the quarters what that means is that for the five key points we have we're going to have 0 0 or an n and an x intercept a center of the period and an x intercept notice 0 0 and pi 0 and 2 pi 0 another n x x axis crossings at ends and center peaks at the quarters so with pi over two we get one and at three pi over two we get negative one so which ones really matter for us well when we graph sine again we're going to take the period and stretch or compress it we're going to put our x-intercepts at the ends in the center for sine and then we're going to manipulate these two key points if you remember two key points for sine remember the quarters of your period those two quarters i promise you that will help you man i can't can't tell you how many students have just completely obliterated some second cosine functions because they don't realize that um i i've never taught trigonometry to students who have taken calculus from me and so i always have to go back and teach them trigonometry and then they finally get the why the graphs look the way they do i hope that you understand why these graphs look the way they do well why this graph looks the way that it is right now why we are getting the peaks at pi over 2 and 3 pi over 2 for sine now that we've talked about sine let's go ahead and finish up with cosine we're going to get a number of really cool things that happen with cosine as it relates to sine namely that cosine is a phase shift of sine and there's an identity we could make with that but mostly why it looks the way that it does so let's start the same way that we started with sine let's look at the ends of our period well how does that relate if cosine x is taking a real number on the x-axis and using that x as an input then that x again represents the arc length on a unit circle or the central angle on that particular unit circle remember arc length equals angle for unit circle because as our arc length equals r theta a unit circle has an r of one s equals theta arc length equals central angle on the unit circle only and so this has to do with radians because that's the way that radians allow us to make that jump on that formula so cosine of x says cosine of some angle here so this is in particular why students get so messed up with it this x is not this x this x as i just mentioned is a real number that represents a central angle or arc length on a unit circle so when we talk about cosine of zero it says go to an angle of zero cosine of zero says here's the output for this angle for this input here's the cosine of this is zero here's the this is your output for cosine x so i'm saying here's my zero my cosine of zero is one well i have one code oh yes that's right that's my x coordinate on my unit circle stands for my output here i'm not going to go to zero and put a zero that zero we're plugging in represents this angle cosine of that angle is your output that you're going to put here why this is confusing for students is because students associate cosine with x and they should but this x remember is your output we're going to put that on our f of x the output of our function so cosine of 0 is 1. if you can grasp that you are going to be absolutely fine with the rest of this is that this x is an input on a unit circle so central angle and what we're getting is cosine of that input that is the output we're plotting on our graph now what's going to happen at uh what's going to happen at pi over 2. let's go to pi over 2. at pi over 2 cosine of pi over 2 says go to the angle pi over 2. here's my input cosine of pi over 2 says that is my output well that's a zero how about pi at pi we're going to say our input is pi pi cosine of pi cosine of pi says i would get negative one how about three pi over two cosine of three pi over two says hey that number that you're inputting represents an angle or an arc length by unit circle cosine of that particular angle of three pi over two is zero and for two pi we get the same thing as we would get for zero so two pi cosine of 2 pi says take the output for cosine of 2 pi that's 1 and plot it so what happens this is different from sine so sine hat it's actually literally just pi over 2 off so sine had x-intercepts at the ends and center peaks at the quarters this is opposite this is going to have peaks at the ends and center and x-intercepts at the corners of this and we'll see this if we fill this out a little bit more i'm going to go fairly quickly through it but cosine of pi over 3 why to pick pi over 3 because cosine of pi over 3 is one half that's nice to graph two pi over three cosine of two pi over three is negative one half four pi over three if you want to find that cosine of four pi over three is also negative one-half if i want to mess that up here's our 3 pi over 2 i had that wrong in my head but 3 pi over 2 cosine 3 pi over 2 is 0 this should have been 5 pi over 3 so cosine of 5 pi over 3 is positive one-half and then we get cosine of two pi is one again so let's let's see if this makes sense with our quadrants like we did for sine cosine is positive in quadrants 1 and 4 here and here that's where x is positive not x here but x the output of cosine is positive over here on this on these two quadrants what that means is that's the first quarter and the last quarter of our period and sure enough cosine is positive there cosine is negative in quadrants two and three that's the middle of the period and sure enough between pi over two and three pi over two the middle of our period we are negative so cosine looks very very similar to sine but almost like it's shifted over and that's exactly what a phase shift is we can make an identity that says cosine and sine relate to each other by a phase shift again this doesn't end this goes for ever and ever and ever so our domain for cosine is you can plug in anything just depends on how far you want to go on your unit circle backwards or forwards negative or positive angular measurement we can see a lot of interesting things like this is going to repeat every 2 pi that's our period again our range is still negative one to one why because x outputs for our cosine for input angle is negative one two one that's the farthest of this goes if the input is an angle and arc length it just says where how many times you want to go around that circle you plug in anything our outputs however can only give you from negative one to one because that's what cosine can possibly be in terms of our x coordinate here it only gets negative one to one that's our range odd functions are symmetric about the origin that's sine but cosine is even because this is symmetric about the y axis you can fold this over and get exactly the same graph our periods are the same and for the same reason for sine and cosine if you went one full rotation around all of your x coordinates all of your outputs here are going to repeat and likewise with uh with sine the important concept here isn't just that the period is 2 pi it's that when i adjust that period what's going to happen is my x-intercepts and my my where we cross the x and where my peaks happen my peaks happen are going to be affected by that change so what we need to understand is that our x-intercepts happen well not at 0 and a pi and a 2 pi not every k pi but at every pi over 2 plus k pi so we'd say pi over 2 plus pi well pi is 2 pi over 2 1 pi over 2 plus 2 pi over 2 is 3 pi over 2. it's going to happen every half circle after that the way we write that is your let's call it your first your first x intercept is pi over 2. well now is that true yeah your first x equals zero let's say your output is zero your first zero is at pi over two but then every half circle there's another zero zero backwards or forwards how we say that add a half circle idea is k pi remember pi is a half of rotation so if i say hey start here and add half a circle you're going to be there that's another zero add another half circle that's there you can be another zero subtract a half a circle that's there you're going to be at another output of 0 for cosine of that particular angle what we see that is pi over 2 great that's going to be a 0 for cosine we know that here and then every multiple of pi it starts to look awkward and some students have a real hard time with that but here's what it means means your first zero your first x intercept is pi over two and then just start adding pi and you're going to get an x intercept every time pi over two three over two five pi over two seven pi over two that's two pi over two that's um every pi okay the key features again are hey cosine crosses the x-axis not the ends in center but at at the corners so we have x-intercepts at the quarters of your period here's your period here's half your period here's the quarter of a period here's the other quarter and it peaks at the ends and the center two relative maxima at the ends one relative minimum in the center now if we reflect it that changes but that's where we peak and that leads us to our key points so our key points for our cosine are zero one pi over 2 0 pi negative 1 3 pi over 2 0 and 2 pi positive 1. so here's what's going to happen in the next video we're going to take a look at our function now we're going to identify what our period is first so here's why this is important and here's what i need to remember if we identify our period first i'll show you exactly how to do that then if we have a sine function you're going to immediately put x-intercepts at the ends and center if you have a cosine you're going to immediately put intercepts at the corners of whatever period that is so how do we do it we put the period divided into 2 divide each of those halves into put the x-intercepts on there for sine and cosine respectively and then you'll have either two relevant key points or three relevant key points the relevant key points here are are the peaks you see the peaks are what can stretch and compress the peaks are what can reflect x-intercepts don't care they're static they're just going to stay there the the peaks can change so multiply your outputs times any number for zero you're not going to change that but multiply your peaks by some sort of output some sort of amplitude it's going to start to start manipulating it's going to start stretching it compressing reflecting it so we're going to take our period we're going to do what i said we're going to we're going to find out what it is cut it in half cut it in half again that's halves and quarters for sine x intercepts at the ends and center for cosine x intercepts at the corners then we take our relevant key points which i have starred for you and determine how the amplitude affects it it's just a multiplication the one thing i want to say right now so you don't get confused we get there is that depending on what your period is this and this and this might change so if your period is not two pi then obviously we're not going to have an end of your period at two pi this represents the ends of your period that represents the quarter so we're going to talk through that as we get to graphing sine and cosine the next video hopefully what i've done in this case is just make sure you understand why they look the way they do the most important concept is realize that this x axis is not this x output this x axis represents an arc length unit circle and therefore a central angle on the unit circle sine of that angle is the y output here and cosine of the angle is the x output here that represents the output height of your functions so i hope that makes sense i hope that i've explained it if you get this man you you're just you're you're ahead of a lot of people who are who are in calculus right now so this is a very very good thing i'll see you for the next video when we start talking about how to take this and do transformations with it see you for that
