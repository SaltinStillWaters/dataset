Transcript for: How to Change the Base of a Logarithm (Precalculus - College Algebra 61)
welcome to another video so this is a very short video this is just about how the change of base formula for logarithms works um where it's important and we see it a lot and it's also going to help you evaluate if you ever need to evaluate some logarithms and your calculator won't let you change a base from 10 or e so it won't let you evaluate for that so i've written the change of base formula twice you'll see it because sometimes we forget especially when we're just learning this that formulas are a lot of times two-way streets so here's what the change of base formula says it says if you have a logarithm with whatever base you you have you can always change the base of your logarithm by creating a ratio pick whatever base you want so if i have log base i don't know whatever a you can change it to log base anything of b over log base same same base of a i usually like to say the bass goes in i used to teach it a long time ago the bass goes in the basement like on the denominator so the argument is in the attic and the base goes in the basement it was super cheesy but it actually worked so if your argument goes to the top on your numerator and your base goes to the bottom in your denominator and you can pick whatever different base you want this is going to create the same exact expression as that does it's very useful a different way that we can can combine logarithms it's the last one or expand logarithms the last one typically what do you want for your base well you're probably not going to change a base of 3 into a base of square root of 11 because that'd be really difficult to use and work with so normally we're changing our base that we don't necessarily want to use or that we have a hard time evaluating into a log base 10 comma log or a log base e natural log that is by far the most common why your calculators almost all of them have the ability to plug in log base 10 and log base e log and natural log but not necessarily a lot of the bases if they do then this is fine it's a great format no problem leave it but a lot of times it won't let you so if you have log base 5 of 18 and you go i can't even plug that into my calculator most of you can't can we change it to a log base 10 or log base e yes if we use a ratio we can do that you've also noticed that i've written this backwards that's because we should understand that if i have two logs with the same base being divided this is not a subtraction it does not create a fraction inside your logarithm it does not create subtraction please don't go back and relearn what i just taught you in the last video please don't do that this right here you can combine it but it takes change of base to do it you can't expand it but it takes change of base to do it so two logs being divided with the same base you create one logarithm and this denominator becomes your base this numerator becomes the argument of your logarithm fascinating stuff so let's get back to this example how would we expand this well we can take and make any any logarithm we want provided we create this ratio of 2 log of the same base so i can pick log base anything over log base anything as long as the same base with 18 as the argument of the numerator logarithm and 5 as the argument of the denominator logarithm now i could put a 7 i could put a square root of seven i could put a seven i'd put 700 if i really wanted to but that might not help as much as keeping this log base 10. so on your calculator if you had to evaluate log base 5 of 18 you probably would do log 18 close that parenthesis divide log 5 and it will give you the decimal approximation for what that is the other way and you should try both the other way what if you picked log base e well i can change this just like this into any logarithm with whatever base i want provided i make a ratio with this log in the same base so ln that's log base e ln that's all of hc make sure your 18 goes here and your 5 goes here argument on the numerator base the denominator now you should try it and hopefully it's it works for you well try log press the log button press 18 close your parentheses divide by log 5. then try ln 18 close your parenthesis and then divide by ln5 they don't give you the same number so while they look different all of these represent the same exact expression they all are the same exact number just different ways to look at it different bases that we have same stuff so we're going to practice two more very very quickly i'm not going to go with any other base besides log base 10 or log base e because those are by far the most common you can put whatever base you want here it doesn't really matter and sometimes that suits you sometimes it really helps to do that to have a certain base for whatever problem you have but that depends on the context in general we usually use a common log or natural log so i'm going to show a common log here and a natural log here for a certain reason so log base square root of 5 no one has to deal with square root of 5 is the base of seven we're going to separate this and we're going to make something a little bit easier for us to deal with so i'm going to pick two logs of the same base whatever that base is in this case it's log base 10. i'm going to make sure that my 7 goes on my numerator and my square root of 5 goes in my denominator if you had to evaluate this now you could you could press log 7 close your parentheses divide log of square root of five and it's going to give you a decimal approximation for whatever that is because this is really awkward to think about uh what power do you need to raise the square root of five to in order to get seven that's really difficult this will allow you to to approximate that and it will give you that exponent which is kind of interesting the last one log base pi of e wow we're really trying to screw it up here aren't we um log base pi of e well that might be quite difficult to plug into a calculator if you're if it does not allow you to plug in for base now let me say this if it does allow you to you can just use that some calculators do say log whatever your base is pi and then of e it'll give you a decimal approximation but even still sometimes we need to write this with a base e or base 10. now i'm not going to choose a common log because i'm looking at my problem understanding that i've got an e there if i have an e it's going to be really nice if i use a logarithm with the same base so i'm going to pick a base of e so log base e over log base e why do i do that well because i've seen the e and when we compose functions which is e to the first power oh it's an exponential raised to the first power over a log base e that inherently this is very important for our solving just a little bit the next video next two videos if you compose a function with this inverse so in other words you pick a log that matches the base of your exponential you've inherently matched a function with this inverse that composition is going to simplify it's going to give you 1. do you remember that remember this base of e this says e raised to what power gives you e to the first that would be one or you have a function composed of its inverse or if ln match up with e you're basically the same we had a property for that either way you go that is getting to be a one this simplifies ln of pi does not simplify and that's as good as we can make it now that should actually kind of uh begin the question so can you do something a little bit different with stuff like this the answer is yeah you can you can pick a different base that matches a piece of it that you want to simplify so what if i didn't pick log base 10. now well we normally would do that what if i didn't what if it benefited me like we're going to see in some of our solving very limited but similar solving what if i picked log base 18. why well because what if i needed my numerator to be one for some reason or what if i needed these bases to switch well i could do that we would get log base 18 of 18. oh my gosh is it exponential compose on a logarithm of the same base that's going to give you one over log base 18 of five you know wait a minute did the bass and the argument just change spots yes and that's exactly what happened here this was our base e was our argument right now e is our base and pi is an argument but it's on the denominator just like this is now on the reverse of this is now on the denominator it's kind of kind of interesting hopefully you see that um so sometimes that's relevant for us we can always match up whatever base we want so we can always pick whatever base we want for the logarithm as long as you use the change of base formula to do it so i hope that makes sense um that's just a little bit of practice making sure we understand how this works as far as expanding combining we see this more when we're solving logarithms so i'll show that to you when we get there most of the time you're going this way so that you can evaluate things a little bit easier hope you enjoy the videos i will see you for another one in just a bit you
