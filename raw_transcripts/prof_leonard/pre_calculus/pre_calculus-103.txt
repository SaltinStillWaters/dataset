Transcript for: Introduction to Right Triangle Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 30)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to take another look at trigonometry up till now we've really only focused on all of our trigonometric functions as part of a unit circle or relating to a unit circle or a circle with a different size radius but really as part of a circle we're going to adjust our thinking a little bit we're going to take a different view as trigonometry relating to a triangle so uptown now we thought hey if we have a circle here then sine of an angle on that circle would give us the y coordinate or y over r if our radius is not y that's what we see that we see sine of theta is y over r cosine related the x coordinate to our radius so sine theta would give you give us x over r on a unit circle is just x because our radius was one and for tangent theta we get y over x this is what we know already we already know that on a circle or a a unit circle sine theta relates to the y coordinate specifically y over the radius cosine relates to the x coordinate specifically x over the radius and tangent relates to the ratio of the y or x coordinates now let's take a look at just this triangle no circle just the triangle something like this often times you'll see right triangles labeled with a b and c as your capital letter points so so we label those with capitals and our sides with lower case letters like little a little b and little c for the sides opposite angles a b and c respectively so if we take a look at this and we identify theta right here very much like we have then in order to translate into right triangle trigonometry we just need to do a few things number one we're going to label the sides of our right triangle very specifically as hypotenuse and opposite and adjacent to whatever reference angle we're given so in this case i'm giving you angle a as theta this is the one we're looking at according to that angle we can label our sides so here's how to label sides the very first thing we do in a right triangle is we always label our hypotenuse first every single time if you're having trouble labeling your hypotenuse what i typically do is i'll put my pencil on the right angle and i'll just imagine a straight line right through the triangle just like that whatever straight line you put through the triangle from angle c is going to intersect your hypotenuse so right here this is our hypotenuse it's very much like our r our r acted like a hypotenuse in a right triangle that was formed on a circle so if we take away the circle on the right triangle itself r is just this distance here we call that a hypotenuse so i'm going to abbreviate height for hypotenuse now that that side's never going to change no matter what angle we're looking at the hypotenuse is always the hypotenuse but in right triangle trigonometry it's very important to understand an opposite side and an adjacent side to whatever angle we were referenced so whatever we're given or whatever angle we're looking at in this case angle a so here's the thought process on right triangle trigonometry if we can identify the hypotenuse look for your angle identify your opposite and your adjacent sides what our trig functions are now going to do is take an angle and relate it to two sides of a triangle that's what trigonometry does all the time for right triangle trigonometry takes an angle and relates to two sides so three things an angle and two sides so once we label our hypotenuse we take a look at our angle that we're given and then we're going to label the opposite side next so if you take a look at angle a and do the same thing we did to find the hypotenuse just imagine a straight line right through your triangle it's going to intersect the side that's opposite angle a or our theta the the angle we're looking at so this is the opposite side the only side that's left over if you follow this technique is going to be what's called the adjacent side adjacent is the side that's next to your angle kind of like a neighbor would be adjacent or right next door to you adjacent is the side next to your angle that's not the hypotenuse that's why we label the hypotenuse first so we label hypotenuse saying this is the hypotenuse no matter what then we label opposite and the process of my elimination says the last side that you have would be your adjacent side so hypotenuse longest side of a right triangle always opposite 90 degree angle identify your angle we've got it opposite side is just imagine a straight line through it you're going to hit the opposite side to whatever angle you're referencing and the last side is jason keep this in mind if we were to take a look at angle b this would no longer be the opposite side this would be opposite this would be adjacent but your hypotenuse never changes also in trigonometry we really don't use this 90 degree angle we already know it's 90 degrees trigonometry often involves these two angles that's really what we're looking at so let's think let's take the unit circle approach and let's apply to the right triangle what sine did on our unit circle it took from our angle the y over the r that would be the opposite side over the hypotenuse and that's exactly what we're going to get here sine theta is opposite over hypotenuse cosine theta is this x distance this x coordinate over our radius or the adjacent side look at that here's our hypotenuse this would be the adjacent side over the hypotenuse that's exactly what we get here for whatever angle we have cosine theta cosine of that angle we always relate an angle of two sides is the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse very much like the x over the r now tangent tangent took the y distance the y height the y coordinate which is the y height divided by the x distance or the or the x coordinate the the x part of our triangle that would be the opposite over the adjacent sides if we're using that angle so here on a right triangle tangent is going to do the same thing we're going to take the opposite very much like the y divided by the adjacent very much like the x if we were to draw this on a x y coordinate system that's precisely what we'd have so tangent takes opposite over adjacent you'll also see a lot of times that people label the sides opposite angles with the lower case versions of them it's actually if you've ever seen the pythagorean theorem before as a squared plus b squared equals c squared that's where this comes from so if we take a look at this the side opposite a we would typically write this as lowercase a the side opposite b so imagine a straight line through your triangle from your angle that's side opposite b you typically see that as a lowercase letter b and the side opposite c remember a straight line through that that's a hypotenuse you typically write that as lowercase letter c can you see right now that if i took a squared plus b squared leg squared plus leg squared i would get c squared that's where that a squared plus b squared equals c squared thing comes from but that also means that we can adjust our sine cosine and tangent so yeah sine theta is opposite over hypotenuse but you'll often see it defined as a over c the opposite side over the hypotenuse side cosine is for sure all the time adjacent over hypotenuse but you're probably going to see this as b over c and tangent theta is opposite over adjacent that would be a over b if we're using a lower case size now could you do the same thing with our our reciprocal functions could you find cosecant of theta could you find secant of theta cotangent theta yeah really easily the the code the the reciprocal relationships still work so if you know sine of theta you automatically will know cosecant theta so you could really just put that this would be c over a but by rights we define it as the hypotenuse over the opposite so if we want to write cosecant theta we're going to get hypotenuse over opposite if you want to take a look at our angle we would take hypotenuse c over opposite which would be a c over a secant is the reciprocal of cosine reciprocal just means interchange the numerator with a denominator so we would have hypotenuse over adjacent and for us that would mean we get c over b likewise for cotangent it's the reciprocal of tangent so we would get adjacent over opposite whether or not you just want to reciprocate a over b or take a look at adjacent over opposite for your referenced angle there we would get b over a i hope that makes sense let me do just a little bit of a recap to make sure that that you're really seeing this so on a unit circle what we did is we said here's your angle and what sine is going to do is compare the y height to your radius that is the opposite over the hypotenuse when we take a look just at our right triangle that's exactly the same thing we're doing notice though you have to go from a specific angle so if you're going to if you're going to identify the opposite sides and the adjacent you have to identify your angle first so we say if that if that's our angle then that's the opposite side then that's the adjacent side your hypotenuse is always the same side no matter what angle you look at which is kind of nice if we take a look at cosine we have x over r and tangent is y over x so for our triangle we have adjacent over hypotenuse and we have opposite over adjacent respectively so we've just made a jump from a triangle on a unit circle to just a triangle we're relating i hope you see it we're relating the same sides to the angle that's given so the angle is relating the same exact two sides for whatever trig function we're doing that that we've already been dealing with it's just we're looking at a right triangle now so we're going to take a look at a lot of examples to make sure that we are really hitting home on this concept to make sure that you really understand sine cosine and tangent as related to a right triangle at this point so the the main concepts here are right triangle trigonometry works on just right triangles that's why the name's there identify your hypotenuse first locate the angle that's either given or that you want to find then from there identify the opposite and then adjacent sides in that order and this goes very smoothly also there's a nice way if you've ever had any bit of trigonometry before there's a nice way to remember your trig functions so sine is opposite over hypotenuse cosine's adjacent over hypotenuse and tangent is opposite or adjacent a lot of times we see this sohcahtoa you have heard of that before so socatoa is just a mnemonic device it helps you remember that sine is opposite over hypotenuse cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse and tangent is opposite over adjacent i can't stress this enough i know i've said it many times but trigonometry always has three pieces to it trigonometry always has at least a right triangle trigonometry an angle and two sides that's all these trig functions do they relate an angle to two sides so how do you remember cosecant is hypotenuse over opposite secant is hypotenuse over adjacent cotangents adjacent over opposite well you could just remember sohcahtoa and reciprocate them okay last bit before some some examples the pythagorean theorem really did work on the unit circle we took x squared plus y squared equals r squared because those were the two legs and the hypotenuse respectively we can get something very similar for our right triangle trigonometry but there's a few different ways that we can think of it the first way to think of it is the basis of pythagorean theorem altogether that really what you're doing is you're taking a leg squared plus a leg squared and equal to hypotenuse squared this is oftentimes how you would teach pythagorean theorem the very first time no a b or c just identifying the hypotenuse and the two legs this works really well for a lot of students because it's it's really just written out for you so if you ever want to use pythagorean theorem like that it's just fine the only thing that i want to say is keep the hypotenuse by itself on one side put the legs together that's really all you have to remember to use the pythagorean theorem keep hypotenuse on one side put the legs together square everything and add the legs that's really about it if you want this in terms of opposite adjacent you can certainly do that the legs themselves have to be the opposite and the adjacent side the hypotenuse doesn't change so you can change this a little bit and that's really descriptive of what's going on for a right triangle we oftentimes will label opposite adjacent and hypotenuse typically though i'm doing the pythagorean theorem before i even get to that point i would always find my sides first if i'm able to before i label the opposite and adjacent sides so you can use that for sure the other way is mostly in textbooks that you see this you'll see that pythagorean theorem because we oftentimes will label opposite sides as lowercase letters of their angles we'll see a squared which is a leg b squared which is a leg squared equals c squared which is the hypotenuse why is it always the hypotenuse because your 90 degree angle is always labeled c opposite of that is going to be the hypotenuse which is labeled lowercase c and so we translate it as a squared plus b squared equals c squared in order to really understand this you would have to actually know a little bit of trigonometry wouldn't you would you would have to know that a and b are the legs and c is the hypotenuse so either one of these is going to work it's just fine i mostly think about it leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared because it works all the time for every right triangle so we're going to get into some examples we're going to talk about how to use the pythagorean theorem to find missing sides and that way we can practice all six of our trig functions so let's go ahead and practice finding some of our basic trig functions the the main six trig functions on our on our right triangles i've written sine cosine and tangent only the reason why i have is because it's going to be very common for us to find sine and use a reciprocal defined cosecant find cosine use a reciprocal to find secant find tangent use a reciprocal defined cotangent so i haven't written those but you can certainly have those handy so sohcahtoa is really helpful we can just reciprocate to find the uh the cosecant the secant and the cotangent so there's a but there's a real order in how we find these trig functions on the right triangle so notice wherever we have a right triangle the first thing we want to do is make sure that we have an actual right triangle because right triangle trigonometry doesn't work on non-right triangles so firstly make sure it works so that's a right triangle they're all right triangles that means that we can actually use our right triangle trigonometry the sine cosine tangent do now relate to opposite over hypotenuse adjacent over hypotenuse opposite over adjacent respectively so we've got that down the first thing we're going to do on any right triangle like ever is label the hypotenuse so take a moment just label the hypotenuse so i'm thinking that's the 90 degree angle i'm imagining a straight line through my triangle not like this right through it it's going to intersect the hypotenuse so i'm going to label that the next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to write down or i'm going to mark somehow what angle i'm given what angle i'm referenced or what angle i need to find so right now the theta is referencing that particular angle now i haven't marked it a b or c it's not super relevant right now but it has marked exactly what angle it wants you to determine the trig functions for and so i'm going to mark that i'm going to say this is the angle i'm looking at according to that angle now label the rest of your side so i already have hypotenuse we're done that's great label the rest of your sides so we're going to label the opposite side after the hypotenuse so i've done hypotenuse i've referenced my angle i've got it according to this angle imagine a straight line through here a straight line through this triangle would intersect this side therefore that 2 that is the side opposite the referenced angle or the given angle or the one you need to find this says we have this as an opposite side the only side remaining if you do it this way is going to be the adjacent side and that should make sense here's our angle one side is the hypotenuse for sure the other side is the one right next to it that's what adjacent means right next to the angle but not the hypotenuse that is adjacent now in order to find all of our six trig functions we're missing a pretty important piece we have adjacent and we have opposite oh now think about this what trig functions could you find right now without doing any other work well you could find all the stuff that doesn't deal with the hypotenuse that would be tangent and that would be cotangent you don't need the hypotenuse to find tangent and cotangent that's important later if we're only looking for tangent type stuff we don't need the hypotenuse to find that so if we're trying to find all six trig functions though we absolutely need to know the hypotenuse so what's going to let us do that if you have two angles in a right triangle or sorry two sides of the right triangle you could find the third side we just need to know the pythagorean theorem so we're gonna write that out the way that i deal with pythagorean theorem i always write it out as in parentheses i just have parentheses squared plus parenthesis squared equals hypotenuse squared i do this every single time every time i do pythagorean theorem and the first thing i write down is the hypotenuse i write down what the hypotenuse is on the right hand side so i always start this way it keeps it very organized in my head it creates a pattern for me i really never make a lot of mistakes because of that so i know hypotenuse is all by itself so what's the hypotenuse i don't know let's just leave it hypotenuse if you want to write a letter c up there that's totally fine now the way that i do it is write hypotenuse and know that my legs go together so i'm just going to write the two legs over here what are my two legs well one of them is three and one of them is two it does not matter the order in which you put those absolutely does not matter what does matter is that in the pythagorean theorem you have leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared in the equation hypotenuse must be by itself b and all of them are being squared your legs have to be together and added together so they've got to be on one side added now we're going to simplify this so 2 squared is 4 3 squared is 9. and that equals hypotenuse squared by the way i'm going to show you the three different versions of this using opposite adjacent hypotenuse i'll show you a squared b squared c squared i'll show you all those things i'm just giving you options as we go through so 4 plus signs 13 that's fantastic equals hypotenuse squared now in order to get rid of a square you need a square root and so we're going to take a square root on both sides now you might remember that when you take a square root you've got to have a plus and minus well with triangles you don't really ever have any negative measurements so we don't need to include that we're just going to take a square root and we'll know that the hypotenuse is the square root of 13. in general you have to simplify that so if it had been something that some square root of a number that we could pull a perfect square out of we would do it and you would leave it as a perfect as a exact answer so you wouldn't want to use a decimal for this we're going to leave them exact so our hypotenuse is the square root of 13. let's put that up there at this point we've done a lot of important work and these should be pretty easy to find you see once we have our right triangle with all of our sides and we have our angle reference and we've labeled opposite adjacent hypotenuse these fall right into place so we first label hypotenuse second find your angle that you are looking at so right here that's our reference angle or a given angle or the angle we need to find we relate the opposite side and the only remaining sides got to be adjacent find the missing sides if you need to and then go ahead and find trig functions so sine takes its e sine is opposite over hypotenuse sine would take look how nice it is if you live i hope you're seeing it i hope you're seeing that labeling this is opposite adjacent hypotenuse makes it nice to find if sine is opposite over hypotenuse i just got to find the opposite side and put it over the hypotenuse side that's 2 over square root 13. cosine would be well cosine is always adjacent over hypotenuse we've labeled that that would be 3 over square root 13. tangent of whatever angle you're looking at tangent is opposite over adjacent that would be two over three those are our three basic trig functions and then we have the reciprocals from there so i hope that i hope you're getting it i hope it you really it's really clicking for you that all trigonometry does is relates an angle to two sides in a ratio sine does opposite over hypotenuse cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse and tangent is opposite over adjacent if we can label those sides from a given angle it's easy to find a couple things about it you're probably going to see this rationalized if you remember rationalizing the denominator we multiply square root of 13 over square root of 13. you could see this as 2 square root 13 over 13 3 square 13 over 13 but this would just be two-thirds now how about our reciprocal functions you got a couple choices you could go back to your triangle and reciprocate all of these so cosecant would be hypotenuse over opposite that would be square root 13 over 2. but if you've already done this sometimes it's a lot easier to remember that cosecant is the reciprocal of sine just reciprocate what you've already found for sine you'll notice something too did you notice that i didn't rationalize that before i found the reciprocal because if we had then we'd have to reciprocate and then re-rationalize so times we're going to find both of these and then rational rationalize them when we have to after that so cosine of theta is 3 over square root 13 that means that secant theta is square root 13 over 3 just the reciprocal and tangent theta is two thirds cotangent is just the reciprocal three halves that is exactly what we would have found if we use the the identities for cotangent secant and cosecant cosecant is hypotenuse over opposite got that secant is hypotenuse over adjacent get that and cotangent is adjacent over opposite it's the same either where you go whether you want to go from the triangle or whether you want to just reciprocate sine cosine tangent either way is fine they both work okay let's move on to the next one so we have a we'll check is what we want to use going to work with what we have so we want to use right triangle trigonometry is it a right triangle yeah it is that means 90 degrees so we do certainly have a right triangle that's fantastic the first thing we do with any right triangle ever label the hypotenuse so right now you should be doing that so if we look at our 90 degree angle imagine a straight line through this is our hypotenuse so we're going to label that hypotenuse is 4. next we take a look at where our angle is that we're referencing either we need to find it or it's given to us or it's marked under triangle and we make a mark there we say this is where i'm going from so i'm going to take a look it looks like this is our angle so i'm going to put a mark up there i'm looking there the next thing we do is label your sides according to that angle so if this is the one we're referencing find the opposite side first notice your hypotenuse is done you do that first every time find the opposite side first that would be three so imagine just a straight line through our triangle from our angle it's going to always intersect the opposite side so that is the opposite side to the angle that's being referenced the last side the one you haven't marked yet with hypotenuse or opposite has to be your adjacent side that happens to be the one that's missing so there's a couple ways to do this the first thing you could do is you could label these a b and c and write little a little b and little c and use the pythagorean theorem that way you could do it the way that i've shown you and use hypotenuse opposite and adjacent just remembering that the hypotenuse goes by itself that's the way i prefer to do it or you can just use leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared you call this any variable that you want it doesn't really matter so i'm going to show leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared so i'm always going to show open parenthesis no matter what i'm really thinking about for the the pythagorean theorem whether i'm using a b and c or leg leg hypotenuse or opposite adjacent hypotenuse it doesn't really matter what does matter is that the pythagorean theorem really is it's a concept more than is a formula the concept is square the legs add them and it must equal the hypotenuse when you square it so all that says is your hypotenuse goes here write that down first so if our hypotenuse is 4 i'm going to make sure the hypotenuse is by itself on one side of the equation and that i've squared it over here on the other side the things that are getting added those are the legs so i'm going to put down 3 squared that's one leg and adjacent squared i can use the word adjacent i could call that a variable x i can call it a letter like lowercase b you probably wouldn't want to use c because that stands for your hypotenuse and most trigonometry so i'm going to just call this b and then we're going to solve for that so 3 squared is 9 and 4 squared 16. if we're solving for b we've got to subtract 9 first so b squared is going to give us 7. now we're not quite done because we do want to solve for b so this is where we take a square root you can disregard the plus and minus for the right triangle trigonometry because the measurement of our our triangles can't be negative we're talking about real triangles here so b is going to equal the square root of 7. so i'm just going to erase this b now that i found it this is the square root of seven from there we should really be able to find all of our trig functions notice what we've done we label the hypotenuse first we label our sides opposite adjacent we find all of our missing sides and then it's pretty nice because your sides are actually labeled so because we've referred from our angle to our sides we know that those sides are in reference to that angle that was already talked about so when we talk about sine of theta is opposite over hypotenuse you've already labeled opposite and hypotenuse according to that angle so we just have to write down the sides that match up with the words opposite hypotenuse for us that would be three over four so sine theta is opposite we've already labeled it over hypotenuse three over four cosine theta cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse so for our angle we've already labeled our sides that would be square root 7 over 4. tangent is opposite over adjacent well that is three over square root of seven i'm gonna double check my work here real quick sine is let's see opposite over hypotenuse i get that through four cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse that's the so and then the co adjacent over hypotenuse square seven over four tangent is opposite over adjacent toa three over square root seven looks really good now i'm going to go ahead and find my reciprocal functions cosecant matches up with sine secant matches with cosine cotangent match it up with tangent they're just reciprocals if you want to go back to your triangle then cosecant would be hypotenuse over opposite or the reciprocal of sine that'd be four over three either way you go secant is hypotenuse over adjacent 4 over square root of 7 or the reciprocal of cosine cotangent is adjacent over opposite or the reciprocal of tangent square root 7 over 3. besides the fact that these two should be rationalized you're done i typically don't rationalize until right now if i did i would multiply the square root of seven over the square root of seven and get three square root seven over seven and here we would multiply square root seven over square root of seven i get four square root of seven over seven that's about as good as we can get those are all six major trig functions of whatever triangle we have and given the specific angle they wanted you to reference okay i'd encourage you to pause the video and try that by yourself see if you can do this see if you can recognize that right triangle trigonometry will work see if you can write down the hypotenuse see if you can write down according to the angle that you're given the opposite side and then the adjacent side find the missing side and then label all six trig functions i'm going to model my thinking this one last time before we get into the co relationships like sine and cosine why they're called that tangent cotangent why they're called that we'll talk about that in just a minute after this example so we're going to start right now the very first thing we do is our model my thinking one last time is in any right triangle we always label the hypotenuse first we do this for pythagorean theorem we do it for all of our trigonometry it's really helpful to label that so we're going to start by identifying the longest side of the right triangle the side opposite 90 degrees it's called the hypotenuse i'm thinking draw a straight line from the 90 degree angle it's going to go right through the hypotenuse this is my hypotenuse the next thing i do i make a mark somehow to know what angle we're referencing so they said theta's here that's the angle they're talking about and so everything's going to be referring to that angle so all my sine theta says hey this is the theta i'm talking about so give me sine according to that angle remember what tree does it relates one angle to two sides that's all it does we need to know all the sides of our do it we also need to label those sides in order to do this properly so according to this angle i'm imagining a straight line right through my triangle this is the opposite side and the only side remaining would be adjacent adjacent means right next to but it's not the hypotenuse so on this angle you have two sides that are right next to it the hypotenuse and this guy over here that guy over there is called the adjacent side now think about this for a second what trigonometric functions could you find without having to find that side everything that doesn't involve opposite so sine tangent cosecant and cotangent all involve the opposite side you couldn't find those but you could find cosine and you could find secant those are two that you do right now cosine would be adjacent over hypotenuse that's 2 over square root of 5. secant would be hypotenuse over adjacent that'd be square root 5 over 2. you could write that down right now if you wanted to if you don't want to that's fine but you're going to have to find that opposite side that missing side in order to figure out the rest of those four trig functions so we're going to do that i'm going to list just leave this in the word opposite i know how pythagorean theorem works i know that what we do is we take our legs squared and equal to our hypotenuse squared so i'm going to write this out in parentheses always write that out in parentheses legs squared added together equals hypotenuse squared i'm going to look at my triangle i'm going to make sure since i've already labeled that my hypotenuse is on one side my legs are on the other side they're together i will have two and the opposite side i'm going to leave this the word opposite because i like to you don't have to you can write x you can write a b or c whatever you want to do there that's fine you can write the word leg that's totally fine i just like it because it tells you exactly what your you've already labeled it gives you very specific instruction on what you're finding so this is pythagorean theorem the legs are together two and opposite cool again my hypotenuse by itself we're going to solve for that so two squared gives us four square just treat it like a variable square root of five squared gives you five five minus four is one now opposite the opposite side squared or whatever you want to call that squared equals one you still have to take a square root but remember the square root of one is just one so our opposite side is one now we're really free to go to find sine cosine tangent and then the reciprocals so sine theta says now that you've labeled your entire triangle sine theta takes your opposite side over your hypotenuse it's 1 over square root 5. if you want to reciprocate right now or take hypotenuse over opposite we'd get square root 5 over 1 or simply square root 5. cosine takes adjacent over hypotenuse notice how easy it is or now how nice it is that you've already have your sides labeled you just have to look at the adjacent over hypotenuse if you remember cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse cosine takes 2 over square root 5. you've already labeled that finding secant is a matter of reciprocating cosine or taking the the sides in the reciprocal operation so that would be hypotenuse over adjacent or square root 5 over 2. tangent tangent is always opposite over adjacent so according to this angle this is opposite we've labeled it this is adjacent we've labeled it it's one over two and cotangent is the reciprocal or adjacent over opposite just 2 over 1 or 2. if you need to rationalize you'd rationalize sine theta that would be square root 5 over 5 and you'd rationalize cosine theta that'd be 2 square root 5 over 5 and that's it that's as much as we can do with our right triangles as far as setting up our trigonometric functions what we're going to do now is come back and talk about why sine cosine and tangent are called have co co-functions so sine and cosine are co-functions tangent and cotangent are cofunctions secant and cosecant are co-functions why that is we'll talk about that we'll see why it's useful i'll actually recall an identity that we talked about in one of our our trig identities we'll see it kind of in a different fashion which is very useful very important i'll show that to you and then we'll do some examples about how to find missing sides and missing angles okay so i've drawn a triangle up here that's all labeled out with a b and c and we see that this is angle a and that's angle b and then we have opposite sides so opposite side to b is little b opposite side to big a is little a or lower case a and this is little c or the hypotenuse now quick question do you remember i hope you remember that the angles inside of a right triangle or any triangle add up to 180 degrees if one of those angles is always 90 in a right triangle the other two angles have to add up to 90 all the time if all the triangles add if all the angles of triangle add to 180 and one of those is always 90 for a right triangle then it's only 90 degrees left and those two angles have to add up to it what we call that when two angles add to 90 degrees is called complementary so complementary angles add up to 90 degrees a and b would be complementary angles now this is really important for us because that fact lets us create an identity in just a minute something we've shown before but haven't really shown for a right triangle so i'm going to get that get to that in a second the last thing i want to do before we get there is talk about why sine and cosine are named the way that they are so sine and cosine tangent and cotangent secant and cosecant are called co-functions for a very specific reason here's the reason we're going to find out right now that co-functions of complementary angles are equal i know that's a that's a mouthful what in the world does that mean check this out i want you to take a look at sine b we're going to figure out all of these these functions right now so sine b cosine b tangent b cotangent b cosecant b c and b if we talked about sine b sine b if we looked at b remember this is an angle trig functions always relate one angle to two sides here's the angle they're referencing so i'll put a little mark up here sine b would take the opposite side to b that would be little lowercase b over the hypotenuse which is c so sine of angle b would be b over c cosine for angle b would be a over c the adjacent over hypotenuse tangent of angle b would be opposite over adjacent that's b over a cotangent of angle b so here's our angle would be adjacent over opposite that's a over b cosecant the reciprocal of sine just like cotangent was reciprocal of tangent cosecant would take hypotenuse over opposite that would be c over b and lastly secant would take hypotenuse over adjacent that's c over a that's all well and good but we know that already we know how to find these trigonometric relationships of a right triangle but there's something that's really interesting here we're going to now take a look at the cofunction of the complementary angle so i want you really look at this sine b is b over c i want to now find cosine the cofunction to sine of angle a the angle complementary to b so let's take a look at cosine of a so cosine of a is the co-function to sine this is cosine this is sine they are cofunctions this is b this is a those are complementary angles remember b plus a has to add up to 90 degrees therefore they're complementary so this is a co function of a complementary angle check out cosine of a if i just erase this for a second cosine of a now this would be opposite this would be adjacent if we're talking about angle a now which we're doing on that co function so cosine of a is adjacent over hypotenuse that's b over c exactly the same as that interesting think about cosine b the cofunction of cosine would be sine the complementary angle to b is a so let's think about sine of a these are cofunctions sine and cosine of complementary angles a and b are complementary they add to 90 degrees so let's take a look at sine of a sine of a would take opposite over hypotenuse that's a over c i hope you're seeing the relationship trying to build the statement i made a while ago was and probably it didn't make a lot of sense but now it should be making more sense cofunctions of complementary angles are always equal every time so if i take sine of one angle and cosine of the other angle those complementary set not 90 degrees they're going to be equal if i take tangent of one angle and cotangent of the other you're going to get the same thing check out tangent tangent b was b over a what's tangent a so there's the cotangent of a so the cofunction for tangent is cotangent so tangent cotangents or cofunctions b and a are complementary this is one angle this is the other one cotangent a is adjacent over opposite b over a just like tangent b what about cotangent b cotangent b was a over b the cofunction to cotangent is tangent the complementary angle is a tangent a is opposite over adjacent a over b exactly like cotangent b was cosecant b is c over b the co-function with cosecant is secant the complement complementary angle to b is a well let's look at secant a secant a would take hypotenuse over adjacent that is c over b exactly the same as cosecant and b and lastly if secant b is c over a then these are cofunctions the the cofunction with secant is cosecant the complementary angle of b is a cosecant a would take hypotenuse over opposite that's c over a exactly the same thing as secant of b so here's the thing this is this is really showing you what's going on this is proving it really is that cofunctions of complementary angles are equal sine and cosine cosine and sine tangent cotangent cotangent tangent cosecant secant secant cosecant these are all co-function relationships they're called cofunctions because this works this way so a cofunction says if you take a cofunction of a complementary angle you are going to get the same thing like i mentioned before if you take secant of a or cosecant of b angle b same thing take tangent of a cotangent of b sine of a cosine of b you're going to get the same relationship now that leads to something because angles a and b are complementary that leads to an identity for us so if i take a look at sine b equals cosine of a think through this identity real quick sine b equals cosine a but take a look at this if a plus b equals 90 degrees let's solve for a if a plus b is 90 degrees then a would equal 90 degrees minus b if we let a equal 90 degrees minus b we can make a substitution so sine b equals cosine of 90 degrees minus b ma i hope you remember this i gave you identity a little while ago i said that sine and cosine are phase shifts of one another graphically but i also gave you this that sine of theta equals cosine of pi over two minus theta this is saying precisely the same thing sine of your angle is equal to cosine of 90 degrees meister angle pi over 2 is 90 degrees so sine of theta is cosine of pi over 2 minus theta this is the exact same thing if you want to change between sine and cosine or cosine sine all you have to do is change your trig function to a cofunction and subtract 90 degrees minus your angle we're going to practice this in just a little bit i've written the rest of them down i don't know that i would try to memorize them it's more of a concept it's more of an idea that co-functions of complementary angles are equal what that allows you to do is change between cofunctions sine and cosine cosine sine tangent and cotangent cotangent tangent secant and cosecant cosecant secant by taking 90 degrees minus the angle so you can always do this with any cofunction tangent b equals cotangent of 90 minus b we're going to practice that right now to make sure that i really illustrate this how to change between a function and co-function just by taking 90 degrees minus that angle it helps us out a lot with simplifying some expressions let's practice this briefly so if i take a look at sine of 30 degrees let's say that i just wanted to change this into cosine y well because one of these has got to change for us to combine something about it sine with cosine just subtracted it's really hard to deal with so what if i just wanted to change this what if we just we're trying to practice changing from a function to a cofunction if sine of 30 degrees has a co-function of cosine then here's how we change it all you have to remember is that if you want to find a co-function 90 degrees minus your angle is how you do it so sine of 30 degrees equals cosine of 90 degrees minus 30 degrees co-functions of complementary angles remember complementaries and 90 degree idea are equal so i've taken sine of 30 equals cosine of 90 minus 30 that's cosine of 60 degrees if you were to look that up on a unit circle right now you would find that sine of 30 degrees is one half cosine of 60 degrees is one half they are equal how about tangent tangent of 50 degrees the cofunction of tangent is cotangent so if i want to change this to cotangent we simply have to take the cofunction subtract 90 degrees minus your angle so tangent of 50 degrees equals cotangent of 90 minus 50 degrees that'd be cotangent of 40 degrees same thing with secant secant of 5 degrees the cofunction for secant is cosecant so if we want to change the cosecant co functions are always interchangeable with 90 degrees meister angle so we take 90 degrees minus 5 degrees that's going to be cosecant of 85 degrees can oftentimes help us if we have some angles intrigue functions that are are different so like sine of 38 degrees minus cosine of 52 degrees there's not much we can really do with that so those are cofunctions that means you can change one of them into the other one of them by using this identity that we have it really stems from the pi over 2 minus angle we've already seen that before and you could do that with all of these things but if we have two trig functions or cofunctions you can change one into the other so sine of 38 degrees minus cosine of 52 degrees i'm going to choose to change the cosine you could easily change the sign it doesn't matter but let's say that i change cosine in my head i know that cosine is a cofunction with sine so if i want to change cosine to sine i just have to change the trig function and take 90 degrees minus the angle wow when we do that because cosine is changeable into sine its cofunction by taking 90 minus your angle then we see that we have sine 38 degrees minus sine 30 degrees that's zero subtracting something from itself gives us zero how about tangent 20 degrees minus cosine 70 over cosine 20 degrees now this looks pretty hopeless because that's tangent those are both cosines it would be awesome if we could just cancel the cosines or simplify 70 over 20 you can't they're all they're one piece so because your trigonometric functions relate one angle to two sides that cosine of 70 degrees is referring to a pair of sides that's what's happening here you can't just simplify pieces of that that doesn't really make sense what we can do is really take a look at it and go i really wish that was tangent now let's think back to our basic trick if i really want that to be tangent tangent is a sine over a cosine idea maybe if i change that cosine into a sine how can i do it remember sine is a co-function with cosine so i'm seeing tangent i really want this to be a tangent so maybe i can combine them tangent is sine over cosine ah i have cosine over cosine let's change this into its cofunction of sine how do we do that cofunctions are changeable by 90 degrees minus your angle so i'm going to say that this is the same thing as its cofunction of 90 degrees minus the angle that i'm giving that's how you change from one function into its cofunction so that's going to be sine of 20 degrees and we see a beautiful relationship because tangent theta equals sine theta over cosine theta sine 20 degrees over cosine 20 degrees gives us tangent of 20 degrees i promise they don't all work out to zero but this one does tangent minus tangent of both 20 degrees is going to give us zero how about we take a look at cosine 35 degrees sine 55 degrees plus sine 35 degrees cosine 55 degrees you go that does not look good at all why why does it look good actually if you think about the sum to product formulas this actually does look pretty good you could you could change that into sine 35 degrees plus 55 degrees and get sine of 90 degrees and get exactly one but if you if you don't see that why it looks bad is because that's cosine sine and sine cosine maybe if i got both these to be sine or cosine both those to be sine or cosine i could combine them so i'm going to try to make both of these into sine and both of those in the cosine what why because sine times sine gives us sine squared and cosine times cosine gives us cosine squared and sine squared of an angle plus cosine squared of an angle gives us one so so that might work really nicely so i'm looking this going let's change this one into sine how do i do it the co-function for cosine is sine these are cofunctions that's what's nice so i'm going to change this into sine but if i do that if i change from a function to its co function it's 90 degrees minus the angle now i'm also going to leave this one alone i want these both to be signed on the other hand i really don't want to get a different angle here so i'm going to leave the cosine alone and change the sign the reason why is because i know that's 55 degrees this one's going to be 55 degrees i don't want to start changing this into 35 degrees because then we wouldn't be able to combine anything i need my angles to be the same so if i've stuck with my 55 degrees here i need to keep my 55 degrees here that means that i've got to change my sine function so because cosine and sine are cofunctions i can change this sign into cosine by subtracting 90 degrees minus an angle here we get sine of 55 degrees we already had sine of 55 degrees plus cosine of 55 degrees that's why we kept the 55 so that all these angles would be the same and another cosine 55 degrees and we know this when we multiply something times itself we get a power 2. so this is sine squared 55 degrees plus cosine squared 55 degrees and beautifully this is the pythagorean identity i hope you remember it when you take sine squared plus cosine squared of the same angle you get one sine squared 55 degrees plus cosine squared 55 degrees gives you 1. the pythagorean identity if you don't remember says that anytime you have the same angle which is why we had to keep it the same of sine squared that angle plus cosine squared the angle you get exactly one that's pythagorean identity it's kind of nice okay last one so i'm looking at one plus tangent square to 5 degrees minus cosecant squared of 85 degrees and i'm thinking back to my pythagorean identities and i'll remember that 1 plus tangent squared plays well with secant squared because 1 plus tangent squared equals secant squared but not cosecant squared so one thing i'm looking for here if i need to simplify that is maybe using a known identity somewhere in this problem but in order to make that work i've really got to change the piece that doesn't fit into it so 1 plus tan squared 5 degrees looks great this is going to give us let's see 1 plus 10 squared theta equals secant squared theta 1 plus tan squared 5 degrees is going to be secant squared 5 degrees but secant squared and cosecant squared are cofunctions that means we can change one of them into the other to be honest either one is changeable you can do it just fine if you want to change secant into cosecant or change cosecant into secant that would be just fine to do i'm going to choose to change cosecant into secant here so cosecant of 85 degrees can be changing its cofunction its secant function by taking 90 minus 85 degrees that would be secant to 5 degrees so if cosecant of 85 degrees equals secant of 5 degrees cosecant squared 85 degrees equals secant squared 5 degrees the reason that is is because it's a whole entire quantity being squared there it's really cosecant 85 degrees quantity squared which is why we can change that into a cofunction and not really worry about that power and that gives it i gotta end with a zero make sure we're consistent with all the other zeros i really hope that right triangle trigonometry has has been explained well enough we understand i hope that you can see the change from a unit circle that had a triangle on it really into just a right triangle yeah we're adjusting a few names instead of calling it y it's opposite and instead of calling x it's adjacent why that is is because the orientation of our angle doesn't have to be the same all the way all the time so so we can't really stick with this is always why this is always x because we can talk about a different angle in a triangle the orientation can be all flipped around and i'm all weird if you will um so we really had to have a different way to look at that so what we know is now we can relate a hypotenuse an opposite and an adjacent side depending on what angle is referenced in a right triangle sine cosine tangent cosecant secant and cotangent i hope i've done a good job of explaining that to you we're going to come back with another video on how to find missing sides and angles with this right triangle trigonometry have a great day
