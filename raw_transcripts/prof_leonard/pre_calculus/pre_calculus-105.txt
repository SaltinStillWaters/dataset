Transcript for: How to Use the Law of Sines in Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 32)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about something called the law of sines why in the world do we need the law of sines or the law of cosines which we're going to talk about in the next video um because up until right now really all we've focused on last few videos is right triangle trigonometry so kind of begs the question what do you do if you don't have a right triangle can you still use trigonometry and the answer is yeah that's why we have the law of sines and the law of cosines so right now in your head i want to build this category like we have sine cosine and tangent to deal with with right triangle trigonometry pretty nicely but if you do not have a right triangle well then you have to use something else to find missing sides and missing angles like pythagorean theorem that's fine or interior angle sum that's great or the law of sines or the law of cosines so we'll deal with the law of sines right now we'll talk about the types of triangles you can get besides a right triangle we'll talk about this idea if you know two things in a triangle you can find a third and how that changes just a little bit when we're talking about a non-right triangle how you need to know three things to know a fourth and why in the world that is so firstly what are these non-right triangles called a non-right triangle is called an oblique triangle and really you can have two cases honestly in all triangles you only have three cases you can have one right angle you can have all angles less than 90 degrees or one angle greater than 90 degrees though the triangle with a right angle is called a right triangle but the other two cases if you have no 90 degree angles and all of them are less than 90 you have what's called an acute triangle they're all acute angles or you could have a triangle with one obtuse angle so all acute are all less than 90 one obtuse would be one more than 90. and that's really it those are the two cases of oblique triangles that we can get so when you're categorizing this oblique triangles are solved with law of sines or law of cosines right triangles are solved with our right triangle trigonometry we've already covered so we needed to know something else because right triangle trigonometry does not work for oblique triangles that's why we got this law of sines and law of cosines so so the first thing is when do they work well there's really four cases four cases of these oblique type of triangles that we can solve the first one is well what if you know two angles in one side or one side and two angles or what if you know two sides and one angle or all three sides or two sides in an angle but the angles between the two sides those sides would be adjacent to the angle these are the four cases that we can solve with law of sines and with law of cosines now i mentioned something a little while ago i said that in right triangle trigonometry you need to know two things to find a third like you would need to know two sides to find an angle or an angle and a side to find a missing side that those are the two things you would need to know to find a third but but really if you think about right triangle trigonometry you already know one thing in a right triangle you would already know one angle you would know a 90 degree angle so really in right triangle trigonometry it's you need to know three things in order to find a fourth you need to know it's a right triangle you need to know an additional angle and an additional side in order to find a fourth side or you need to know 90 degree angle you need to know two sides in order to find a missing angle and so really because you already know it's a right triangle it kind of reduces that to oh i need to know two things to find a third but in right triangle trigonometry remember you already know it's a right angle so you know three things to find a fourth that's exactly where we find ourselves in law of sines and law of cosines with non-right triangles you need to know three things in order to find a fourth thing you need to know two angles and a side to find a missing side you need to know two sides and an angle to find a missing angle you need to know all three sides to find a missing angle so those are our cases here i hope that you can see that that in a right triangle you already know one angle and so it reduces that to just two missing things and it would actually fit a lot of these models so we're going to take a look at what works for what our first two cases for law of sines our last two cases for law of cosines when we get there i'm going to show you that so let's take a look at what works for our law of sines here's what we can do if we know two angles and one side whether that side is between our angles or not these are the two cases you could have knowing two angles in one side we can solve for the missing sides really really easily with law of sines how could you find the missing angle it would not require law of sines oh man i remember i hope you remember in the last couple videos i've been telling you use non-trigonometry stuff if you can because it's easier you would not want to find that angle by anything to deal with our our trigonometry like law of sines or anything what we want to do is just use interior angle sum all three angles add up to 180 degrees if you know two angles you automatically know the third one so that's pretty nice but if you know two angles in one side you can find the missing sides with law of sines that's what that does now what if you have two sides in one angle and the angle is not between them that's that's pretty key so one of the things about the next two videos is understanding what works whether we're using law of sines or whether we're using law of cosines because this one and that one get confused an awful lot you can probably see it in both cases you know two sides and you know an angle but this angle is not between the two sides these sides are not adjacent to that angle and that one that the sides are adjacent to the angle that you know so law of sine says if you know two angles in one side use all signs if you know two sides in an angle and the angle is not between those sides the sides are not adjacent to the angle use law of sines these are both cases where you use log signs i do want to talk a bit more about this guy this is what they call an ambiguous case and the reason why is because this can give you one of four results you have four results how would that happen well i want you to think about this if you do not know this side then this side can be really short this side can be really long and this side can be not long enough to make it down to it so there's one of four things that can happen here the first thing that could happen is you could actually get no solution with this if you know a side a side and an angle not between them you could actually end up with the case that this is too short to make it no matter what you do cannot make it this is not going to make a triangle out of it that wouldn't make a triangle so this could happen in this case and you're not able to solve it so there would be no solution here if you know this it will make a triangle and you can find the sides that it would take to make that but notice you're kind of fixing two sides here and you're fixing an angle this side could be too short to actually make a triangle this is one case where you would get no solution what's the next case the next case is that this could be perfectly long enough to make a right triangle exactly one right triangle that could be one of the cases so first case is too short you only make triangle second case is you make exactly one right triangle that would be if this is exactly how long it would take to make this side this side match up with a sign on that angle so you could you could definitely do that the the third and fourth case is what if this side is longer than this what if it becomes too long well then you have two more cases that could happen you could get you could get one triangle that's all acute or one triangle that is uh one obtuse angle so they're both oblique but this is two cases do you see how you could get two solutions here you go oh yeah this side would be fixed this angle is fixed if you don't know this side length and it could be anything then you could do uh maybe think of a shorter side that would cause an oblique angle sorry an oblique triangle with an obtuse angle or you could have a longer side which would cause an oblique triangle with all acute angles there's two cases there an obtuse triangle and an acute triangle i hope you're seeing that that this side could kind of kind of pivot so our our three cases so far are no triangle it misses a right triangle it's perfect if this side's too long you could get two cases one an obtuse one and a cube now i need you to notice something this only can happen if this side is shorter than this side why because if this side that can make your two options are shorter than this side then you can go ahead and put that down to this missing side and not kind of overrun it you don't have this this case if this side is longer than this side so if it is if the second side is longer than this called first side then you really only have one option if this side's longer then you can't make this obtuse angle come about why because if this side is longer than this side it would go past this side that third side that you don't know that would not cause a right triangle or sorry not cause a triangle because that angle is fixed so there there's really four cases uh you have this no triangle you have a right triangle you have a i could have two options if this side is shorter than that one i have one option if this side is longer than that one now that seems like a lot to remember don't worry about it the law of sines will take care of this for you i really just wanted to go through these so that you would understand why sometimes you get one right triangle and why sometimes you get no triangles why you get sometimes two and sometimes one that's not a right triangle and it really just comes down to if this is too short you can't make a triangle if it's perfect you make a right triangle if this is longer than perfect you could get two if this is longer than this one you only get one that's the reason why and so when the law of sines tells us what we're getting out of that this is this is why you don't have to memorize it which is very nice this will take care of it because sign will show you whether it's possible or not and we're going to get to some examples of course in this video that explain exactly what's going on and i'll be referring to those cases so the only two cases that really work for law of sines are you know two angles in one side or one side and two angles or you know two sides and one angle but the angle is not between them this is when you use law of sines and work itself out you will know whether you have one none or two solutions uh with this case this one will only give you one solution every time so this is easier now what if you had some other instances where you know three things you're trying to find a fourth you could have two sides and one angle between those sides you could have all three sides that are known those would be known three things in asking for a fourth thing these are done with law of cosines we'll also learn how the pythagorean theorem is really a special case of law of cosines how you can know one angle and two sides and it will give you a third one you wait a minute how would that happen well you know one angle and right triangle already you know the 90 degree angle so i hope you're saying in all these cases you need three things to find a fourth you need two angles and a side to find another side you need two sides and an angle to find another side or another angle you need two sides and an angle to find another angle or another side you know all three sides to find angles so you know three things to find a fourth one what we're going to do now is talk about what in the world the law of science is how it works it's a very nice proportion you will understand why you need to know this when we go through it and then we'll practice some examples so provided you have one of these two cases one side two angles or two sides one angle not between them you can use law of sines what in the world does law of sines mean well firstly you're using law of sines on non-right triangles because you have right triangle trigonometry to deal with the rest could you use it on a right triangle yes yeah you really could but you don't need to so law of sine says if you have this this triangle this oblique triangle with our angles a b and c and our opposite sides listed as lowercase letter a lowercase letter b lowercase letter c so abc again the first thing i want to remember is you don't need any sort of law of sines or law of cosines or right triangle trigonometry if you know two angles to find a third because a b and c those angles on a on a flat plane always add up to 180 degrees the interior angle sum of any triangle on a flat surface on this plane is 180 degrees so if you know two angles you can automatically find the third that's really nice don't use law of sines for that just use interior angle sum if you know two angles already so anyhow we have this is pretty important our angles are going to add to 180. what the law of sines does is creates proportions for you and they're really nice it's probably something you'll be able to memorize pretty quickly here's what it says in plain english sine of an angle over its opposite side always equals sine of another angle over its opposite side so all we've got to do is match up on each fraction angle with opposite side so for law of sines that's going to say find sine of angle let's say angle a over its opposite side which is lowercase letter a equals sine of any other angle over its respective opposite side so let's take sine of b these two things are going to be equal sine of a over a equals sine of angle b over side b it's also equal to any other angle over its opposite respective side so sine of angle c over lowercase c this is the law of sines now there's one really common mistake that the students make because they don't quite understand what's going on here they try to use this whole thing at once don't do that this is not meant to do this this is meant to create a proportion all it's saying in plain english is you can create a proportion what's a proportion a proportion is simply two fractions that are set equal to one another so just set two fractions equal not all three because then you can't cross multiply it it's crazy so all it's doing really is creating a proportion for you one fraction equal to another you don't use all three it says find an angle and it's opposite side set it equal to any other angle over its opposite side now here's what i want you to see can you see that because you need to know sorry can you see that because you're setting up a proportion ignore this one for a second you would need to know either two angles and one side cross multiply to find the missing side or two sides and one angle cross multiply to find the missing angle that's exactly what we have here two angles in one side two angles and one side cross multiply finds a missing side you don't need to find the missing angle because of interior angle sum that's why this works how about two sides one angle no two sides and one angle you can cross multiply and figure out the other angle that's that's really nice that's how this worked you don't use all three of them if you just need to find c it's okay it doesn't doesn't really matter what we call these things you'll see that as we're going through that all we're really trying to figure out is do i know an angle and it's opposite side can i relate that to either a missing angle over its known opposite side or a known angle over its missing opposite side and then we just cross multiply it's not a hard process you just need to be able to identify that two angles one side you use this and two sides one angle but the angle is not between them you use this so anyhow we'll see that as we go through some of our examples but long story made short use interior angle somewhere you can use it first it's really nice to do it doesn't cause any error in our problem so the angle we find with it we can use for law of cosines or law of sines with no errors and then really we're just using one proportion you're not using the whole thing at once so let's go ahead and try some examples let's go ahead and practice some so we have i put the loft signs up there again i put the interior angle sum of a triangle up there just so we can have something a reference to let's take a look at these examples let's determine if they fit law of sines if we can solve them and then we'll set up an appropriate proportion and you'll find it's not too bad you'll also find that this case angle angle side or side angle angle is easier than side side angle y this only has one case so if you have this it is easier you're finding a side with law of sines and there's not multiple options for you this one you have four options now we don't need to know what those options are going into the problem but it does cause us more work i'll spend more time on side side angle just because there are those options we'll i'll give you an example of a no solution i'll give an example of a one triangle i'll give you an example of how you have the options of two triangles that are possible here so we'll deal with that one so these are nicer so first let's make sure that it actually fits let's take a look at our triangle in our triangle we're seeing that firstly it's not a right triangle so right triangle trigonometry does not work right there like if you're seeing right triangle trigonometry doesn't work put this in the category of all right i'm dealing with either law of sines or law of cosines we do need to know what works where three sides law of cosines side angle side with the angle between our sides law of cosines anything else that we have we're dealing with law of sines so notice we need to know three things to find a fourth in any triangle right triangles that was included because you have that right angle in there that means you need to know two to find a third because i already knew one so let's see i know an angle an angle and a side oh that's great hey angle angle side or side angle angle that's something i can solve with law of sines so right in my head i'm thinking i'm dealing with law of sines i'm probably going to write this out actually right out of proportion if you're going to deal with law of sines you're going to be dealing with a proportion write that out now i'm going to let that kind of hang on for a second and i'm going to do what i've taught you how to do in all of right triangle trigonometry use non-trigonometry things or i guess it's technically part of trigonometry but use things that are not like law of sines or right triangles or non trigonometry to find missing pieces if you can so if i have side angle angle if i know two angles the very first thing i'm doing besides checking if it's a right triangle is i'm finding that missing angle so if i know that this is 95 degrees and now that i know that that is 45 degrees i'm going to put this as well 180 degrees minus those two angles another thing we might do as we're doing that is start labeling your triangle so i'm going to subtract 180 minus those two angles but it is nice to call them something so here's here's one point though it doesn't matter what you call them they could be angle a b or c it doesn't really matter so just just pick a letter so i'm going to pick a and then after that everything kind of flows into place as far as your sides so if this is angle a let's call this little a i don't care what that angle is let's call this little b or lowercase letter b why because it doesn't matter if this is a b c or a b c for sine law of sines of work all law of sines does is puts sine of two angles and sides opposite them in a proportion so you can cross multiply that's all it does so i've looked at this i said not a right triangle i thought okay what do i have i've got two angles in the side great i know three things what category does it fit it fits law of sines because two angles one side is dealing with law of sines i've written out my proportion i know i'm going to fill this out in a minute i've labeled a triangle using a because there's a missing angle lowercase letter a because it's opposite lowercase letter b because if i wanted to call this angle b that would be the side opposite again it doesn't matter whether that's b or that's b that's c or that c that doesn't matter then i'm going to be using non-trigonometry like law of sines type things to find missing pieces so i can find angle a angle a is just 180 degrees minus 95 minus 45. so already we know that angle a is 40 degrees now here's why that's useful it's because when you find that angle you subtracted you're not compounding air you don't even have any air we know that this is exactly 40 degrees and why that's important is because you can now use it in other formulas without having any error so now we're ready to go we know all three angles and we know one side all right so what do we do now create a proportion whatever side you want to find all we're really looking for is know three things to find a fourth so you need to know two angles and one side that's opposite them what that really means since that's the only side we actually know is we're going to have to create this proportion with an angle over the side we know equals an angle over a side we don't know or an angle over side we don't know that means you're going to be doing two equations here let's go ahead let's solve for lowercase letter a first so all we're doing is creating a proportion we say hey sine of 95 degrees an angle i know over 5 the side opposite that i do know equals sine of either one of these will work use 45 over b or 40 over a i said i'm going to solve for a so i'm going to take side 40 degrees over side a so now that we have that we have sine of 95 degrees over 5 that's an angle i know over side that i know equals sine of 40 degrees over a that would be an angle that i i know over side that i don't i'm going to cross multiply every proportion can be solved like that so let's do it what we're going to end up getting is a times sine of 95 degrees equals 5 times sine of 40 degrees if we divide both sides by sine of 95 degrees this is what's called an exact answer this is the exact length of that side use lowercase letters for your sides that way when you solve them you won't make the mistake and actually call aside an angle or something like that so that's a side length this is the exact amount but it's not super useful in application because we don't really understand how much that is so we're going to approximate you can put this entire expression on your in your calculator if you use parentheses appropriately so most calculators what they do is they would open up a parenthesis around that sign so close that before you start plugging this in put a parenthesis here and then close that one and then press divide or press fraction and it'll make a fraction out of this so i would put parentheses 5 sine and that's an open parenthesis 40 degrees i'm going to close that one close my my numerator press divide or press fraction and then sine 95 degrees make sure your calculator is in degrees we get that a that side is about 3.23 whatever the units are and give you any units here but 3.23 units in this case which is pretty impressive that we can do that now here's what not to do begging you please don't do this please do not try pythagorean theorem with this being 3.23 why not two reasons number one that's not a right triangle so pythagorean theorem will not work secondly that's rounded and so if at all possible we do not want to use rounded values in future math now we're going to come up with some cases that you have to like law of sines sometimes you have to um especially when we have multiple steps in a problem like the last example i'm going to give you but try not to because that compounds your errors so we've looked at it we've said that is angle angle side great find another angle put it in there now you can use that find other other pieces and you you actually had to to find that then create law of sines as a proportion angle you know over side you know equals angle you know over sides you don't then you can cross multiply next find the other side but do not use that in your proportion why well we just talked about it if that has error in it because you round it even says it right there don't use it again so find another proportion that relates an angle you know to a side you you you also know uh equal to an angle you you know over the other side you don't if you know all three angles it's fine you should be able to do this just fine so we're going to put sine of 95 degrees over 5 again equals sine of 45 degrees over b you do not want to use this as your known angle inside because that is not really fully known it's an approximation so we take a look at it again angle i know oversight i know using stuff that was given to me not stuff that i found that i rounded equals angle i know over side i still need to know i want to find so 45 degrees over lowercase letter b so i'm going to double check um yes this is angle and opposite side this is angle and opposite side i'm not using approximations looks really good now we can cross multiply and divide so we've done the work we've cross multiplied we divided i put this in my calculator all at one time just so i don't make a mistake of rounding and using that in future math so i put parentheses here and around my numerator press divide you should end with about 3.55 if you round into the same decimal place so this side is approximately 3.55 that's done we've solved the entire triangle we've all three angles it did not take law of signs to do it we use proportions to figure out the other two sides that's it that's all law of sines does it creates proportions so that you can cross multiply the last thing i'm going to mention what if you were to use this on a right triangle well if you were to use this you would get sine of 90 degrees at some point in your proportion what's sine of 90 degrees it's the same thing as sine of pi over 2 that would give you just one and what would happen is you would create just a right triangle trigonometry equation out of that where you would get sine of an angle instead of sine over sine so it's that's really all it is you could use it with a right triangle it's just assigned to 90 degrees gives you one and eliminates itself from that equation all right let's move on and try another example so i'm going to model my thinking i'm going to move a little bit quicker because we've already kind of experienced this once if you would like to you should probably stop this video and try that on your own see if you can solve that using what what we know about it so here's here's my thought process the first thing i'm looking for is will right triangle trigonometry work can i use sine cosine tangent and make it easy on myself um it doesn't look like it because that's not a right triangle so how do i know it's not a right triangle i'm doing some math kind of quickly in my head realizing that's also not 90 degrees so this is not for sure not a right triangle the the next thing i'm doing is i'm probably thinking what's going to work to solve so i'm looking at this going hey i know two angles and i know one side wait two angles in one side means i can use law of sines for this so in my head i'm thinking law of science the other thing i'm thinking is if i know two angles i'm gonna be able to find a third one so i'm probably gonna label it first and think if this is angle a then that would be lowercase letter a we don't really need to know that right now um if this is angle b then this would be lowercase letter b if that's angle c this would be lowercase letter c it does not matter what you call the angles or the sides because law of sines only works on proportions you just need to know two angles on one side to find a fourth or two sides of one angle to find a fourth piece of information whether it's a side or an angle so that's what i'm thinking i'm thinking not a right triangle i'm thinking i can find that missing angle first i'm going to do that first i've labeled my sides now i'm going to use the interior angle sum i'm going to find that angle because i want to do that in order to use it for law of sines so let's take care of it so we found that angle a is exactly 45 degrees this is not an approximation this is why we can use it in our law of sines and why we want to find it first so i thought what do i need to do first that doesn't use the trigonometry i'm about to use like law of sines love cosines or right triangle trigonometry i found that missing angle now what i'm going to do is look for three things i know and one thing i don't in a proportion so if i'm thinking law of sines i probably am going to write out the proportion law of sines first the proportion that creates then i'm going to put two angles i know over one side i don't because that's exactly the what we the case that we have for law of sines we know two angles you know three we know one side so i'm looking at this thinking hey this is the only side i know so i'm gonna have to use this angle with this side and one proportion i don't know the other sides so i'm gonna take sine of 45 degrees over 3 an angle i know over a side that i know that is opposite equals any other angle over one of the sides that you don't know i'm going to pick sine of 50 degrees over the side opposite it now here's what you can't do don't go sine of 45 degrees over 3 that's great that's an angle over an opposite side equals sine of 50 degrees over b that's not how the law of sines works law of sines takes an angle over its opposite side so as long as you're doing that that should be fine so i've thought sine of 45 degrees go across the triangle that's the opposite side sine of 50 degrees go across the triangle that's the opposite side it's going to be lowercase letter c if we cross multiply and divide which you can do pretty quickly we're going to get c times sine 45 degrees equals 3 times sine 50 degrees and if we divide we get 3 sine 50 degrees over sine 45 degrees and we use our calculator we're going to get an approximation this would be your exact exact solution but that right there well let's see we can put this in parentheses 3 sine 50 degrees in parenthesis again and this parenthesis over sine 45 degrees we get approximately 3.25 units so i'm going to create my proportion but really i'm thinking i've got to use this proportion again because it's the only side i know that is not rounded so sine of 45 degrees over its opposite side equals sine of i want to find this missing side it's only one left and that's its opposite angle so i'm going to take sine of 85 degrees over the side i want to find i'm going to double check uh let's see angle opposite side got it angle opposite side that i don't know got it i'm not using rounded numbers it looks pretty good so we're going to cross multiply and divide remember there's no um there's no two options here you're just finding a side length and there's going to be only one solution that makes that happen it's not a multiple case scenario like the next few examples we're going to deal with so cross multiply and divide we're going to ultimately end up with b equals 3 sine 85 over sine 45 degrees you should really work that out for yourself now we get that b is about 4.23 so we've solved this triangle we used interior angle sum to find the missing angle that was pretty easy and then we're using the proportions that law of sines creates remember you're not using all three of these at once that's not the idea the idea is this will create a proportion for you of either two known angles and one side that you know to find this inside or two known sides you know with one angle you know to find a missing angle what we have done right here so far is we've just used um the two angles we know on the side to find a missing side that's the easier case we're about to get into the case where you're trying to find a missing angle and more options can happen okay let's start another example we're going to take a look at the case where you're not finding just a missing side with law of sines which is what we did the first two examples it's pretty easy at least it's easier we're going to be finding a missing angle with law of sines we need to be really careful about this this is one of those cases where you could have four options now do you need to know which of the four options happens before you go into the problem no that's the beautiful thing about law of sines the sine function will tell you what's possible and what's not possible and so we'll deal with that not a problem so let's take a look at it and see if it even fits our model so i'm looking at triangle i'm thinking i actually don't know if it's a right triangle or not the only thing that i know is i don't know for sure if it's a right triangle so i'm not going to be using a right triangle trigonometry i hope that makes sense like we don't know yet all we do know is that we are given two sides hope you see it and an angle where is that angle that angle is not between those two sides that would have to be here if that angle is between those two sides it would be here so we're going to categorize this can you see that a lot of students would use either law of cosines or law of sines on the wrong thing so we're going to look at this and say hey i really know a side and then a side and then an angle that's not between them that is exactly what this is talking about or an angle in two sides uh in that order that's fine it's just we don't say that because anyway so we know two sides and we know one one angle this is a is a case for a law of sines but i need you know that with this more than one thing can happen and we're going to see that as we go through it so first things first after identify it's not a right triangle or maybe not a right triangle we're not sure about what it is we just have two sides an angle not between it i want to think in my head this is law of sines i might even write down the proportion i might think in my head what do i need in order for this to work i need two angles and one side or i need two sides and one angle hey that's exactly what i'm given from there i'm going to be labeling what else is going on in my triangle so i want to give names to these things i'm about to find so i might call this angle a and this would be lowercase letter a i might call this angle b then this would be lowercase letter b i might call this angle c and this would be lowercase angle c i might do that just to give it some names it does not matter what sides or angles you call them as long as your letters you're using match up so c with c b would be a with a uh that way it's it's a little bit easier to see what's going on you don't you don't want to confuse those letters because a lot of signs really would get confusing then um so that's what i'm doing the next thing i'm doing is i'm seeing if anything besides my law of sines will solve for any of this man i only know one angle and so there's no way for me to find those other two angles without something besides interior angle sum i know two sides but can i use pythagorean theorem to find the third no because i do not know if it's a right triangle so i can't use that we're stuck with law of sines so let's go ahead let's let's figure it out well let's see if i go ahead and i try to find use law of sines i know two sides and i know one angle so i'm going to create a proportion out of one of the things that i already know i know one angle and i know one side opposite to it do you see that that has to be one proportion you you use if not you'd say uh well an angle i don't know over 2 equals an angle i don't know oversight i don't know that's not helpful so you need to know one complete piece of information that's why in both these cases you need to know an angle and one side that's opposite to it we saw in the previous two cases you had to know at least one angle and one side opposite to it now we know one angle one side opposite to it let's create that proportion so angle with opposite side equals well what do i do now i need to have another proportion with only one unknown that means that i'm going to have to use that 2 somehow i can't use that letter c in that letter c because i know neither of those we wouldn't want to do that we want to say sine of 50 degrees over 3 equals sine of angle i don't know oversight i don't know that's also not useful it's too many variables so pick out this relationship that you know one complete proportion and you know half of the other one that's half the other one you either know an angle or a side we dealt with knowing the angle in the last two examples now we're dealing with you know a side so what side do i know i know side two what angle is opposite that side angle b i'm going to double check let's see 50 over 3 so that's one proportion equals i can do sine of b over a known side that's great this leaves me with just one unknown now we're going to cross multiply and we're going to divide so sine of angle b equals 2 sine 50 degrees over 3. this is where some other information has to come about i'm going to tell you exactly what we're going to do before we get there that way it's not a surprise so here's what's going to happen in order to solve for angles man you need inverses do you remember that i hope you remember that in order to solve for b you need to take sine inverse of both sides now i also need you to remember that on a unit circle from 0 to 180 degrees on a unit circle you can get two angles that give you the same y coordinate this is why we get more than one option for side side angle is because sine of an angle or an angle can have two equal y outputs one on one side one another that are both positive that we can use and i'm going to show you that in just a minute so step number one is creating the the proportion correctly we're cross multiplying step number two is after you get there you need sine inverse so that's an old piece of information we need to bring up we're going to solve for b on your calculator you press sign inverse it'll open a parenthesis for you 2 sine 50 degrees close your parentheses divide by 3 and that will all be inside your sine inverse we're going to get about some sort of an angle here notice that this is the exact angle this is what angle b is for short contains all the information about angle b it's just not super useful so i'm going to approximate and we're going to get about 30.7 degrees i'm not going to write that up there because it might be two different triangles it could give us this and here's how to discover what that is so i this is the second piece of information i told you we're going to get to we need to understand that if we have some sort of an angle let's call it theta on a unit circle that angle if it's a positive angle all of our angles are positive on triangles um everything's between 0 and 180 degrees on our on our triangles to create this either acute or obtuse angle it's past 90 degrees so every single angle on our unit circle positive angle is going to give you this y coordinate now with sine remember what sine does this is this is where the old stuff comes back at you is that the sine function on a unit circle gives you out the y coordinate that's what it does on a unit circle this angle would have a positive y coordinate do you see why you see this positive y axis you're going to have a positive y coordinate but you also hopefully remember that there was another case where you could get a positive y coordinate anything in quadrants 1 and 2 sine is positive why because the y coordinate is positive in quadrants one and two so there's another angle that would give you out the exact same value it's the angle that you would reflect now this is great this is okay but i'm talking about this is option one but this one right here is option two i need you to think about what that angle is so this angle is theta and the reflected angle gives you the same exact y output which it does then this angle would be 180 degrees minus that data it's like oh you went too far how much did you go too far i went too far theta so going to 180 degrees minus theta that will give you the other option for a side side angle uh law of sines proportion so i'm going to take this 30.7 degrees and what i'm going to do is i'm going to subtract 180 minus 30.7 we'll go through it one more time with you this angle 30.7 degrees will have a y coordinate 180 degrees minus 30.7 will have exactly the same y coordinate on a unit circle so therefore sine of 30.7 and sine of 180 minus 30.7 will be identical what that means is that this angle could be one of two things provided it makes a triangle for so we're about to find that out i'm going to call this option one for b i'm going to call this option two for b option one is that we have 30.7 degrees option two because of what i've just explained to you because angles positive or 180 minus that angle will give you the same y coordinate then this can be 180 minus 30.7 well that's 149.3 degrees now how in the world do we know if those are both options or only one of them works or or if none of them works look at your triangle look at your triangle and plug it in if this option 1 gives you 30.7 is there enough left over in your triangle to create an angle that adds up to 180 yes yes there is you go yeah if this is 50 and this is 30.7 there's enough in 180 degrees to subtract both of those and still be left with an angle think about 149.3 degrees option two try that here try option 2 and b 50 plus 149.3 degrees that's like 199.3 wait a minute all of our triangles can have at most and exactly 180 degrees so if you go over that you have a problem that is how you determine whether or not there's two triangles or only one i'm going to go through that again because it can be confusing the first time you hear it we take a look at this and go hey if i plug that angle in here there's enough left over for me to still have an angle if i plug this angle here there's not enough in the interior angle sum for me to still have that angle therefore there's only one option that actually works if that doesn't work and you keep on going watch what will happen even if this is a god that doesn't make sense watch what would happen if you keep on going let's try to find angle c if this is 30.7 degrees then i would take angle c angle c would be 180 sure interior angle 7 is 180 minus 50 minus 30.7 would that leave me with anything well let's see angle c would be 99.3 degrees okay that seems pretty reasonable because 99.3 or about there i should use the equal signs that are approximated why well because this is approximated you can't use an approximate angle and somehow get an exact angle so let's see if this works if this is about 30.7 degrees rounded and this is 99.3 degrees and this is 50 that still adds to 180. that's great that's that's exactly what i want check out if option 2 were put in there if option 2 were put in there at 149.3 and you tried to find angle c we'd have angle c would be 180 degrees minus 50 minus 149.3 and we would get angle c as about negative 19.3 degrees and go wait a minute does that hey that's exactly what we talked about when i said does that work and we plugged it in we got 1 99.3 that's 19.3 degrees over 180 that's going to show up here so if you ever get a negative angle your triangles can't have negative angles not a real triangle that we're talking about right now all of your angles are between 0 and 180 degrees all of your angles have to be positive so if we break any of those things then this option is not possible this is how we determine whether we have one solution two solutions or no solutions so when we're going through this you do have to think about your options here with the angles that you're finding so find your first angle let me start let me kind of go back a little bit if you are talking about side set angle find your first angle give it both options using what you know about the sine function that sine of an angle and sine of 180 degrees minus that angle that's all you have to do to subtract 180 minus your angle will give you two options check both how do you check both just use interior angle sum so use option one if it gives you a valid angle you're good use option two if it gives you a valid angle you're good if it doesn't then that's not possible which means that this angle is wrong too this is not an option for you what if it gives you no possible angles then there's no solution and that's exactly how we go through the cases you don't need to know all four of them it will work out in your sine function so which is the valid case well not option two so this one worked but this one does not work so i'm gonna yeah this this isn't right for us so we only have one option here if we had two options it causes you a lot more work because it says there's two triangles here you have to use that to figure out your missing sides from those two triangles so i know for right here that this is 99.3 degrees for angle c because our only option for angle b was 37 30.7 degrees so we figured out both of our angles that's typically what we do when we're using law of sines for side side angle is you find your first angle why because you have to you can't find a side first why not if you only know one angle and two sides you can't find a missing side you have to find another angle first in fact you had to find that angle first that angle gave you two options option one or option two only option one was valid because option two came up with something that was a contradiction you cannot have a negative angle in a triangle so we only had one option if you had had two options you'd be drawing another triangle right now you'd be saying okay i have one that's 30.7 i have another one that is whatever it is 149.3 if that had worked and then you would use that to find the last remaining side so you could have more work on this now that we only have one option we know that's about 34.7 we know that's about 99.3 we're going to find the missing side now what i've said this whole time is avoid using rounded numbers if at all possible in this case it's not possible to avoid to to avoid using those rounded numbers you're going to have to use one of these two angles which one it doesn't matter which angle you you actually are forced to use they're both going to be equally rounded so it doesn't really super matter um so we have to use this at some point to find that missing side that's okay it's just something that that we're dealt with so let's set up the law of signs again what law of sine says is a if you know uh two angles and a side you can find a missing side i do know two angles and a side now here's what what i won't do i won't use too many rounded numbers but i can avoid it so what that means is i probably am not going to go sine 30.7 over 2 equals sine 99.3 over c why because that's rounded and that's rounded avoid using rounded numbers as much as possible use the things that you're given if you can so i'm certainly going to say sine of 50 degrees over 3 because both of those are given and they're not rounded equals sine of angle i know over opposite side that i want to find so 99.3 degrees over c i'm going to double check stuff i know this is opposite things i want to know over an opposite angle that looks pretty good i'm going to cross multiply and divide so at this point this is exactly like the first k first examples i gave you where you knew two angles and one side now you know two angles in one side so it's kind of simplified the case for you so cross multiply and we're going to divide i hope you're seeing also that while we want to avoid using rounded numbers as much as we can we actually did that we avoided using that rounded thing in lieu of using this one sometimes it is not avoidable with law signs because you had to find that angle to find that side and that's rounded that's approximated so c is going to be 3 sine 99.3 over sine of 50. that's about 3.86 whatever units those are last little bit to ch sort of check your work um not prove that you're right not find mistakes but at least that you haven't you haven't made one is that bigger angles open to bigger sides so 99.3 degrees should open to the biggest side because that's the biggest angle it does uh 30.7 should open to the smallest side because the smallest angle it does and that should be right between them so that's a great way to check your work it's why i draw a triangle the last one is hopefully it's obvious these two not have to be to scale um they don't have to represent the correct angle 99.3 is over 90 degrees it's an obtuse angle it's just a way for us to get a picture down so we can we can visualize it so it doesn't have to be perfect man i hope that's made sense i hope that you're seeing that while this one is pretty easy because you're just finding a missing side and there's no options this one can be a little tougher we really have to know what we're doing and it relies on your knowledge of what sine function does on a unit circle so when you find an angle you need to have two options and we're going to do that with this the law of sines so we have our two options we go through both of them if they both work you have twice the work you have to do more work here set up two triangles if you don't or at least draw write this twice it's fine you can erase it if you if you don't have two options then it will show with just some logic you're gonna get a negative angle somewhere it will show that you don't if you have two cases that they don't work both of them don't work then you have no solution so let's keep on going i'm going to show you next the case where you have two triangles that are possible all right let's go ahead and try another one so we're taking a look at our triangle we notice that it's not specifically telling it's a right triangle we don't know really what it is so we're not using right triangle trigonometry we're taking a look at it then are we in the case where we have law of sines are we in the case where law of cosines look at what you're given i'm given two sides i'm given an angle that's not between them also one thing i want to say a lot of textbooks will in in your homework or your practice or whatever they'll give you a triangle with a b c and a b c as angles and sides and it'll say hey do this if little a is this and little b is this and angle c or whatever is is this um when they do that they're just drawing a triangle like i'm doing you just have to do it yourself because they probably don't want to waste space or something i don't know so that that could happen just draw your triangle make sure you have the angles and sides in the correct relationship so i'm looking at this thinking i'm going to be using law of sines or cosines i see that i know two sides and an angle not between them that's going to give you law of sines also in my head right now i'm thinking i'm probably going to have two options coming out of this i definitely have options maybe both of them work maybe one of them works maybe none of them work but i'm certainly going to have two options in finding that first angle so i'm thinking law of sines i'm thinking side side angle i'm going to have to find an angle first i hope you see why you can't find a side first here there's not enough information to do that so i know i'm finding an angle first i might label it i'm thinking lot of signs i might write down the proportion sign over side equals sign over side but ultimately what i'm going to look at is let's start labeling these i might label this angle a in which case the opposite side would be lowercase letter a maybe this is angle b over lowercase letter b and this would be angle c over lowercase letter c you don't have to write the b and the c you can if you want to it doesn't really matter but you need to label the things that you you don't know and label them with the letters matching opposite so a with a c with c b with b if we know two sides we are only missing one side but we're probably missing other two angles so what can we do what can't we do you can't use pythagorean theorem we can't use right triangle trigonometry because we're not sure and we also can't use interior angle sum of a triangle which means that we have to use law of sines or in other cases law of cosines first it also means that we're going to have to use some rounded values in future math but we're going to avoid using too many if we can so i know that this is going to be law of sines i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to set up my proportion okay what's that mean i'm going to have to set up one fraction with things that i fully know so an angle over a side law of sines requires that you have to know at least one full relationship an angle and its opposite side now i know that i know 40 degrees and two perfect now to find a missing angle you need to know another side well we do that's what side side angle tells you you would know a side and an angle those will be at some point opposite one another and you would know one more side but not an angle opposite so i know this side this is going to set up with finding angle c notice right now there is absolutely no way for us to find angle a angle a over a would not would not create something where you know three parts to find a fourth we do not know interior angle sum so there's no way to do that right now you're forced to find angle c well it's kind of nice it eliminates options but then it creates more by finding that angle so sine of angle c over three i'm gonna double check hey 40 degrees side opposite got it sine c of side opposite that i know i got it so at this point we're just going to cross multiply we're going to divide we want to make sure that we're not dividing both sides by sine c because you're trying to solve for the angle c so we're trying to eliminate everything around that angle so divide by two and hopefully remember that if you have an angle so sine of an angle equals some sort of relationship that that angle is sine inverse of that relationship so our angle c is sine inverse of all this stuff or takes sine inverse of both sides so angle c is exactly sine inverse of all of that stuff use your calculator approximate it so c is about 74.6 degrees now it's time to think if you just found this angle and you used sine to do it remember that sine has two options to give you out the same value on a unit circle you could have one angle positive angle or 180 degrees minus that angle it would give you the same thing it's kind of like taking a square root of a number you do a positive and a negative you go hey because x squared will square both 2 and negative 2 to give me 4 then both of those are solutions because sine of two angles gives me out the same value they both would have to be solutions here now how do you find it it's it's really right here your angle or 180 degrees minus your angle will give you out the same value according to the sine function they're both giving you out the same exact output and therefore they would both be possible solutions so we think through if c is 74.6 degrees then 180 degrees 74.6 180 degrees minus 74.6 degrees would be the same thing according to our sine function now are both of those valid this is the time that we check we really have to think about it imagine that c is 74.6 is that going to leave you enough in your interior angle sum to develop another angle yeah it appears so 40 plus 74.6 isn't 180 yet that leaves you enough for to complete the interior angle zone check option two plug in 105. if this were 105.4 degrees and that's 40 degrees still would that leave you enough to add up to 180 and allow room for the angle yes this is the case where you actually have two solutions so both of these are valid for interior angle sum it will work out if you just do interior angle sum right now it'll show you you'll get no negative angles so the last example when we did it option two gave us a negative angle it was this impasse like you got to that's not possible perfect well try everything until it actually shows you whether it's possible or not so all we've done is say hey sine functions give you these two angles out that have the same y value on a unit circle so sine of 70 sine of 74.6 degrees would give you this out or sine of 105.4 degrees would give you this this thing out either the angle or 180 minus the angle now walk through and see if interior angle sum that's what you're using is valid for both of these so option one if option one is 74.6 degrees then angle a would be approximately 65.4 degrees that makes sense that's not a negative angle that doesn't ruin our interior angle sum so i would put that down could you now go and use this information to find lowercase letter a absolutely so this you'd have to use a rounded number but you'd use sine of 40 degrees over 2 equals sine of 65.4 degrees over the last remaining side that you need to find what about this information option two option two would be take the angle 105.4 degrees think about this as that you might want to draw another triangle here option two if option two is the case and we've drawn another triangle then angle a would equal about 34.6 degrees that's also valid so we haven't run into anything that says this isn't possible we've used sine to give us two outputs and both of those outputs create triangles for us this if this if these angles are positive still and they're not negative once you've used interior angles if there's enough to create triangles with both of these angles you have two triangles available notice how you don't need to know the outcome before you start you just you really really need to give two different angles using 180 minus the angles you find that's pretty important so once we do that if we have it run into an impasse this is right this is right they're both positive i'm going to make this 34.6 degrees and now we're able to find our missing sides for both of those triangles this is why it requires more work is because now you got to go all right i can take sine of 40 over 2 equals sine of 65.4 degrees over lowercase letter a or i can take sine of 40 over 2 equals sine of 34.6 degrees over lowercase letter a i'll give you two options because there are two triangles a shorter one and a larger one this is exactly what's happening okay so i've drawn two triangles just to make it easier for my brain you don't necessarily have to but i think it's a really good idea that way i can double check for option one our first triangle i want to use given information over using um these rounded things so i'm using sine 40 over two i got it equal sign 65.4 over a i can't avoid using this rounded thing but i want to avoid using that one at the same time so use only one if you can so sine 40 over 2 that's given over sine 65.4 over a that's rounded but it's the least amount of round information i can use um i'd solve for a in that case option 2 says use sine 40 over 2 still equals sine 34.6 over a that will solve for the second option my other missing side on my my last or my my option two triangle so a is about two point eight three or one point seven seven for those two options uh you should work both out we're just cross multiplying dividing and rounding cross multiplying dividing and rounding and i'm going to put this up there just to make sure that larger angles are opening to larger sides so 2.83 and 1.77 a double check it looks like wow all three of my angles add to 180 all three of my angles out of 180 haven't broken the interior angle sum that's what tells you whether you have one option two options or no options it appears that that my larger angles are opening to my larger sides smaller angles of smaller sides that looks really good so i've used that to check my work not to tell me whether i've made a numerical mistake but at least i haven't made a proportion mistake i hope that makes sense it's the hardest one understanding that when you find sign you have two outcomes that will satisfy this that sign of an angle then which one works or if both of them works is a matter of interior anglosome so check that out hope that makes sense i'm going to come back with one more example before an application about what happens if you get no solution all right let's move on to another example i know already ruined the suspense for you and told you there's no solution but let's see why that is you're actually going to really like this case uh once you understand it you're going to really like this case you're going to think give me 30 of these because you don't have to do any more work with it it's kind of nice so let's go through the whole process i'm going to model my thinking one more time just to make sure that you see this right exactly how i want you to uh the first thing that we do is we see what works for for what we're given if we have a right triangle and you know it's a right triangle then you're using right triangle trigonometry if you know that you have two angles given you're using interior angle sum we don't need to touch law of sines until that happens so we're looking at this thinking yeah it's not a right triangle i'm thinking uh that's not right triangle trigonometry i'm seeing two sides in one angle that i'm given that means i can't use interior angle sum to find a third so i'm really just left with the the side side angle and that means i'm using law of sines if i would have had an angle here and not here that would be law of cosines it's the next thing we're going to talk about so i'm seeing side side angle or angle side side i'm seeing two sides and angles not between them this is law of sine so in my head i'm thinking that i might go ahead and label this so if this is let's say b and c then that would be side lowercase literacy opposite it after that i'm really just focused on doing the law of sines so i'm going to set up my proportion law of sines works by taking one proportion of things you already know with a mixed proportion of one thing you know one thing you don't um if you have two sides that means that you're going to have sine of an angle that you know over sine of a side that you know so 60 degrees over its opposite side which would be 4 equals sine of i need to have one proportion of something that i actually know i cannot do sine of c over c because i know neither of those things i have to choose sine of b over a side that i know you need to know three things to find a fourth and that works i'm going to double check sine of 60 degrees over a side that's opposite it those are both known equals sine of b over a side that is known that's an opposite side and it's a side that's known so i know three things i'm going to find that fourth if we cross multiply we get four times sine b equals five times sine 60 degrees now we're going to solve for angle b so let's divide by 4. and then we're going to take sine inverse i want you to notice something this is precisely what we've done for the last two examples we noticed it wasn't a right triangle we labeled stuff we saw we had two sides and one angle that's not between us so we chose law of sines we set up a proportion and then we solved we solved for that angle in the first case we had one option that worked and one option that didn't in the second case we had both options that worked and we had to form two triangles and solve them and in this case let's try to solve for angle b we're still going to use sine inverse it's still the same process it's what happens next that determines what you do if you have two angles that both work two triangles if you have one angle that works one triangle if you have no angles at work no triangles so let's find angle b and so we have this sine inverse of 5 sine 60 degrees over 4. so you take your calculator up and you plug it in you go sign inverse and you do your parentheses 5 sine 60 end parenthesis divide it by 4 and it goes error what do you mean error stupid calculator why would you give me error it's because this isn't possible so if you get error here you're done why but why are you done i want you to go back one step i want you to go back one step and figure out what this is do it on your own right now do five times side 60 and parenthesis divide by four and it gives you 1.082 something something something 1.08 something now think oh man i hope you remember what is the range of sign like you plug in anything the domain of signs all real numbers you plug in anything you want but what's the range of sign the range of sign is negative one to one and since we're only focused on zero to 180 degrees the range of this particular sign because we can't have negatives for our our sine values here is just zero to one you will not get out anything if you plug in a number to sign besides negative one to one in our case zero to one so wait a second and that that by the way is because we don't have negative angles and all of our angles are between zero and one eighty so you can only get out zero to one so look what's happening this says sine of your angle is 1.08 when you plug in this angle sine of this angle is over one that can't happen side can give you a maximum of one so this is breaking the range this is not possible for side even give you so this angle is impossible there is no angle that you can plug in take side of it and it gives you what you need to complete this this picture this is an impossible picture to complete where does it show up if you don't do this first it's going to show up right here as an error now double check your work make sure that you've done everything right 64 b 5 cool so i've done this i have i haven't misplaced anything i've solved it i've done sine inverse i make sure my calculator is plugged in correctly this still gives me an error that means that this is more than one that means that this angle is impossible there is no solution here so what that says is that no matter what you do you cannot put an angle here that makes this triangle possible it's not possible to do and so we have a no solution this is the case for side side angle that none is possible so i've given you no triangle i've given you exactly one triangle and i've given you two triangles are possible what about the exactly 190 degrees that will show up in the one triangle case so that'll show up as oh yes you have just one possible and it turns out the other angle is 90 degrees so that'll work there as well so we're going to do now hopefully that makes sense we're going to come back with one application and then be done okay last one so a lot of times you're given this type of a problem in a right triangle trigonometry section i i actually gave you one in a video that said suppose that you are standing a certain distance away from let's call it a volcano and you measure 47 degrees yay and i am a certain distance away from the center of that volcano how in the world you supposed to know how far away you are from the center of volcano i said maybe you look at like the google earth thing and you you measure out like distance wise how far you are but that takes a lot of technology to do that so what if you're not able to do that what if you have no idea how far away this is from where you're standing could you still figure out an approximation for the height the answer is yeah so suppose you did this suppose that you stood at this point you don't know how far away this is but you measure by looking up maybe a clinometer or something like that that this is 47 degrees that you're looking up at the top of this angle elevation top of the volcano is 47 degrees you say hey there's something i can do though without knowing this distance but knowing that i can stand back a certain distance further 900 feet 900 meters whatever this is 900 meters in this case and measure the angle again now that's physically possible to do you could stand at one location measure stand a known distance away and measure that angle again and find out the height of this this object so we're going to it's a two-step process we're going to do we're going to use this information to figure out one of these distances and then use a right triangle to figure out the height that is going to be possible to do with some right triangle trigonometry but we'd have to know one of these sides first so let's think about how we can do that what do we know so far we know that this angle is 35 we know that this angle is 47 we know that this is 900 that's all we know however if we think about just this triangle could you find that angle yeah because that's a that's a straight angle that's 180 degrees this would be 180 minus 47 degrees would leave you with 133 degrees now we're left with that triangle what does that triangle tell you well you know two angles and a side that is law of sines so let's go through the two angles and one side that we have used before in a couple examples the first two examples to figure out either this side or this side which one it it doesn't matter if you figure out this side then in a moment we'll be using a right triangle with one side known one angle known and you can use sine to figure the height if you choose to find this side which i'm going to do you have one angle known one side known and you can use that to figure out your height either way actually works but the important point here is that you know two angles and you know one side you're thinking law of sines and when we have two angles before we even use our law of sines let's find this missing angle as we did every time hope you remember the first two examples you have to find this angle why because this angle relates to the only known side that's opposite to it that's going to be 12 degrees so 180 minus 35 minus 133 gives us 12 degrees because we know that let's label some other pieces to this maybe that's um that's angle a and little a this is angle c and little c this is angle 12 and 900 so we don't need letters for that and you have your choice i'm not asking you to find both of those missing sides really just one of them because it's all it's going to take to find the height i'm going to choose to find a lowercase letter c as a side so because we know that this is law of sines let's set a proportion of what law of sines does for the last time is takes sine of angle over opposite side equals sine of any other angle over its opposite side now you do have to use a known proportion so i need to use sine of 12 degrees over 900. that's why it's so important to use the interior angle sum before you do law of sines with the angle side angle is because uh you have to have a known proportion equals sine of another known angle remember you will know all three if you have two angles in one side so a sine of another angle over the side you want to find in this case i want to find side c you do with either one i want c i'm going to double check angle i know over side i know that's opposite angle i know over side i want to find that's opposite looks good to me we're going to cross multiply and we're going to divide we're going to end up getting c times sine 12 degrees equals 900 sine 133 if we divide by sine 12 we get 900 sine 133 degrees over sine 12 degrees there's no two outcomes here we're not dealing with finding an angle so this is the side length that we're getting that's the exact side length actually when we approximate it we round it and there comes the um the error in it and it's okay it's it's a little more usable uh for our pythagorean theorem we're gonna actually have to use that rounded number so we try to avoid rounding any time we we can and this would be exact but to use it later on for to make our math a little bit nicer easier we're going to round this and say that this is about 3165.86 meters now what did we just find this is why we drew the the triangle the way we did so we could identify that this is this side right here so that's 3165.86 meters approximately that also means that this side is 3165 point meters and we're almost done you see now that we know this we used 47 degrees for only one purpose really to find that angle we already knew this was 900 so we found this missing side could you have found this missing side yes but in either case you would have gone you now have this right triangle you have either 35 degrees a height that you want to find and a hypotenuse oh it's a right triangle hypotenuse that you know we can use right triangle trigonometry with the sine function to figure that out or if you would have found this side you would have a hypotenuse that you know you'd have a height that you want to find and 47 degrees an angle that you know you can again use the sine function but you use a different angle and consequently a different hypotenuse either way now i can't do that one because i don't know that side i know this side this hypotenuse so i'm going to label this as hey what's the angle that i'm given that angle from that angle label your hypotenuse your opposite and your adjacent all right well what do i know what do i what do i not want to find don't really care about in our case having gone from the angle that i know and the side that i just found which was our hypotenuse i really don't care about the adjacent side all i'm really looking for is the opposite and i've been given the hypotenuse so adjacent is something i'm really not concerned about this says you will be using sine sine of what sine of the angle that you just referenced which is 35 degrees why why that one why not 47 is because you found the hypotenuse for that triangle the one that had 35 degrees in it so sine of 35 degrees equals opposite i don't know if it is height over hypotenuse which is 3165.68 meters keep in mind we try to avoid using rounded numbers if at all possible but in this case it's really not avoidable unless you want to plug in that entire thing now you could do that you absolutely could but it just makes our mouth look pretty really nasty um anyway it's it's your your choice here i'm rounding and using that because that is that's what i i chose to do based on the kind of necessity of not using all that all that junk at one time you could but it's your option so we're going to multiply both sides by 3165.86 if we do that if we approximate we're going to have 1815.86 meters and you're going to look at that and you're going to say yeah but remember what you've done you have a height to you and your face is probably not on the ground looking up at that volcano sort of explodes and your face is on the ground it's getting burned so you're looking up from a height of well for me it's about two meters so i would have to know what that height is and add that to it so i'm going to add 2 and so we get 1817.86 meters don't forget to add your height if you don't do that you'd have to find an angle of depression and do more trigonometry which is kind of a bummer it's easier just to add your height to height to your eyes to that so here's what i hope i hope that have explained the law of signs in a way that makes sense i hope that you understand that the knowing two angles in the side you're just finding the missing side with law of sines it's pretty it's a little bit easier with the knowing two sides and an angle not between them you have that two options that you really need to get because sine will give you out sine of two angles would give you out the same exact y value the circle creates two options for you so work your way through that i hope it's made sense if i'll explain in a way that you understand hope you're doing well and i'll see you for the next video on law of cosines have a great day
