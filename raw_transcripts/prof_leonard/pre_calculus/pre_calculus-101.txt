Transcript for: How to Use the Double and Half Angle Formulas for Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 28)
hi there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to use the stuff that we just proved in last video we're going to use the double and half angle formulas for sine and cosine and tangent um are they hard no not really i mean they're just they're really just some formulas we're just practicing right now the two hardest things about this are figuring out sine and cosine of an angle that you don't know we've done that many times we've done that many times with with a lot of the things like drawing the triangles and figuring out the quadrant the other one is finding the quadrant for alpha over two or theta over two as the case may be that can be a little bit challenging but understand something about this when they ask you to find all of this stuff all of the double angle and half angle formulas for a trig function by giving you just one of them if you can find sine and tangent you can find the rest if you know the quadrant you can find the quadrant for alpha alpha or theta over two and you have to be given the quadrant in order to do any of this stuff so let's suppose that cosine theta equals three fifths that would be given to you let's also suppose that they tell you theta is somewhere between zero and pi over two so that would be quadrant one so they're they're telling you a few things here they're telling you what cosine theta is which allows you to understand the x and the r for the appropriate quadrant that you're in they're also telling you that theta is between zero and pi over two so theta is in quadrant one that says some important things that says that sine cosine and tangent are all positive why because if the angle is in quadrant one all of those trig functions are positive in quadrant one furthermore when we get here to theta over two if theta is between 0 and pi over 2 then theta over 2 is half of that between 0 and pi over 4. it's also in quadrant 1. so when we get there i'll show you that as well but number one thing is we know cosine we know it's in quadrant one let's find sine and tangent so that we can work through all this stuff fairly quickly so we're in quadrant one now being in quadrant one we can draw where that angle is and identify x and r from that we've done it many times we're just drawing a triangle but because we're in quadrant one we know that x here and r here x being positive would put you in quadrant one or four which is why cosine is positive in quadrants one and four but in our case v in quadrant one says you're going to have an x of three and an r of five in quadrant one in order to find sine and tangent you have to know what the y is because we're in quadrant one we know that y is positive so sine and tangent will also be positive we just have to use the pythagorean theorem to do that and doing just a little bit of work we get that y equals plus or minus the square root of 16. 25 minus 9 is 16. take a square root of both sides we've done it a few times here we'd get plus or minus 4. this is the same exact logic as the plus and minus that we're going to get for all of the half angle formulas that you see on the board we need to identify the quadrant to know what sign to pick so if we have quadrant one identified for angle then y is positive in quadrant 1. that's why sine is positive in quadrant 1. it's also why tangent is positive because both x and y are positive that is the same logic we're going to use we need to half-angle formulas so for us we said hey cosine theta is three over five that's x over r so x is three r is five we know it resides in quadrant one let's just draw a triangle in quadrant one that represents what cosine's telling us the x is 3 and the r is 5. not a problem the radius is 5. finding y becomes a matter for pythagorean theorem we know quadrant 1 says y is positive in this whole quadrant in fact in quadrants 1 and 2 y is positive so we're going to pick positive 4 and not negative that right there allows us to find both sine and tangent of theta without even knowing what the angle is so sine theta takes y over r tangent takes y over x so we get four fifths and we get four thirds respectively now we're ready just to find the formulas for our double angle and half angle illustrations here that i'm using so if we have sine of 2 theta really what we're going to do is find the formula write it down and evaluate with the triangle that we just made we already know cosine we know sine we know tangent we're just going to be substituting so sine of two theta there's only one formula for the double angle sine formula so sine of two theta is always equal to two sine theta cosine theta that's the only one we really use a lot for for sine for sine of two theta so sine of two theta equals this the things and things not to do it's really difficult to try to take whatever this angle is double it and try to figure out the trigonometry from that because that's what you'd have to do if you didn't have a formula you have to go over here and say hey this is my theta now let's double that i don't know what it is then let's figure out all the trigonometry from that i don't know what that is and then we can answer sine of two theta that's a really hard problem instead we say let's use the formula that we've we've produced that we've proven and now based on two theta being sort of simplified into 2 sine theta cosine theta this is that theta if we can just find sine of theta and cosine of theta we will now know sine of 2 theta based on the formula but we already know those things so we can just write down two times sine theta is four-fifths this is the same angle as that it's just we're multiplying by two and we have a formula that lets us do that what what you can't do the other thing is we can never pull out factors inside angles we can't ever do that we can't say oh this is just 2 sine theta it's not the way that works that's why we did the whole entire video last time on how this stuff actually does work so sine of 2 theta is not just 2 times 4 fifths in fact it's 2 times sine theta which is 4 5 times cosine theta which is three-fifths and that's really all we can do we can use a formula we've created based on some trig functions that we've found to find something that's that's unknown so sine of 2 theta in our case is well let's see 24 over 25 2 times 4 times 3 is 24 over 25. so we can find trig functions like sine of two theta by using formulas but it's really hard to do directly we almost always have to have some sort of an identity that lets us do it so this is the way we walk through that i suppose it's pretty cool not even knowing what the angle is we can find sine of 2 times that angle let's go ahead and do cosine 2 theta so cosine 2 theta does the same thing it says pick one of the double angle formulas for cosine which one it doesn't matter whichever one works easiest for you so let's suppose that you only had to find that well if you only had to find that maybe you would use one of the the functions for the or sorry one of the equations for the double angle formula for cosine that was based on what you already had for instance if this is not making sense to you for instance you know that you're given cosine right you have a few choices for cosine 2 theta you have cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta but that involves both cosine and sine you have 1 minus 2 sine squared theta and you have 2 cosine squared theta minus 1. so look at what you're given what you're given is cosine theta if you hadn't have had to found or find any of this other stuff which involves sine and cosine you could certainly take 2 cosine squared theta minus 1 that cosine theta is that cosine theta so this would simply work out to 2 times well if cosine theta is 3 5 cosine squared theta is 3 5 squared minus 1. just do that that is based on the cosine that you already knew you would not have had to find sine or tangent if you were only looking for that thing so what this means for us is hey 3 squared is 9 5 squared is 25 so 9 times 2 is 18 twenty-fifths minus one so let's see eighteen twenty-fifths minus twenty-five twenty-fifths that would be one that's negative seven twenty-fifths so cosine two theta is negative seven twenty-fifths now what if you wanted to do it differently would it give you the same answer yes of course having three options can't save some work like like i showed you you would not have had to do this if you were just finding cosine two theta but let's say you wanted to use one of the more common ones um not the super different but you could have said cosine 2 theta equals cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta notice something right off the bat that if you choose to use that formula for the double angle cosine that you're going to need no sign so that causes you a little bit extra work it causes you to have to find that now if you've already done it it's not really a big deal to use but if you hadn't that would have been easier so cosine squared theta says take your cosine that's three fifths square it minus take your sine that's four fifths square it and subtract it so nine twenty-fifths minus sixteen twenty-fifths wait a minute 9 minus 16 is negative 7 that's still negative 7 25 so anyway you go whether you want to use this one because you were given sine cosine or this one because you're more comfortable with it or if you want to use the other one the other one would be 1 minus 2 sine squared theta and if you had that you'd you might not want to use that because you were given cosine but if you were given sine instead you could certainly have used 1 minus 2 sine squared and got the same exact thing so no matter which way you go with the double angle formulas you're going to yield the same result just do whichever one looks easier to you if you already have all of them take your pick it doesn't really matter let's go ahead and do our half angle formula for sine and half angle formula for cosine this is where knowing the quadrant is very important so i'm going to show you with the plus and minus with our formula and then the very end will determine which one to take the positive or the negative so sine of theta over 2 well that's half of some other angle theta and so when we use our formula we're going to show this as plus or minus square root 1 minus cosine theta over 2. that's our formula hopefully you can look that up you have this next u or maybe you've memorized it sine theta over 2 is plus or minus square root of 1 minus cosine theta over 2. now do you know cosine theta yes yes it's right there it's talking about that angle this is why the half angle formulas are so nice i have no idea what that is i know where it is though we'll talk about that in a second but i don't know what it is but i do know what that is so it relates it to something that i know by a formula again what you can't do you can't just say let's pull out the one half it does not work that's why these identities exist is to be able to change arguments to be able to look at this under a different lens rather than theta over two because it's really difficult lets us do easier things with it so we're going to go ahead and say all right this is plus or minus square root of one minus because cosine theta is three fifths we can substitute that one minus three fifths is two-fifths two-fifths divided by two is one-fifth if we take that square root and apply to both the numerator and denominator we're going to get square root of 1 which is 1 and square root of 5 which is square root of 5. now we do oftentimes rationalize the denominator you can probably do in your head at this point but you multiply by the square root of five over the square root of five 1 times the square root of 5 is the square root of 5. square root of 5 times itself just gives you 5. so you have this choice to make right now the sine theta over 2 is either positive or negative square root 5 over 5. now which one this is why i've been training you this whole time to draw a picture of your triangle in the appropriate quadrant because take a look at this if this is theta theta is in quadrant one we all know that it even says that where's theta over two really look at this you could seriously do this cut this in half this would be theta over two in what quadrant does that lie well if i cut something in quadrant one in half this is still in quadrant one so i know for sure that theta over two is in quadrant one could you do it differently yes you can more algebraically you can do it right from here so i'm gonna erase a little bit of this but if you took this and divided everything by two why by two because theta divided by two is theta over two that's fantastic what do you do with inequalities when you divide your center piece that that middle inequality of the double inequality by two well you divide the the wings or the sides by two also zero divided by two is still zero we never change inequalities when you divide by positives theta over two is exactly what we want it to be theta over two and pi over two divided by two is pi over four here's what this means if your original angle is somewhere in quadrant one then half of that angle is somewhere in quadrant one between zero and pi over four it's like even more in quadrant one it's totally in there you can even see it if this is somewhere in quadrant one then half of it is somewhere in quadrant half of quadrant one uh zero to pi over four it's somewhere in there all that to say that sine cosine and tangent will still be positive if sine cosine and tangent are all positive in quadrant one this is still in quadrant one it's actually between zero and pi over four that's definitely within quadrant one so theta over two is in quadrant one if sine is positive in quadrant one it's positive in there as well so we would look at this and say this is still in quadrant one take the positive and now we would know for sure that sine of theta over 2 is positive square root of 5 over 5 and not negative you can't take both of them you got to choose one depending on the quadrant that's why it's in your note that way that with your half angle positive negative is determined by the quadrant of alpha over two or in this case theta over two let's go ahead and let's do cosine theta over 2. we're going to use a very similar formula so with cosine theta over 2 it looks really similar but that's a plus right there but by doing that because we can't just pull out a one-half or something we've allowed ourselves to look at an easier angle something that we already know so one plus cosine theta would be one plus three-fifths do some similar work uh we're not subtracting we're of course adding so let's see five fifths plus three this is eight fifths eight-fifths divided by two is four-fifths if we take an applied square root we're going to get 2 over square root 5. and if we rationalize the same exact way multiply by square root 5 over 5 the square root of 5 we're going to get 2 square root 5 over 5 because the square root times itself gives you that radicand now which one do we pick the positive or the negative from all of our discussion we know that our angle our theta over two here our angle is somewhere between zero and pi over four that's what we showed mathematically that's what we saw in our graph but in either case it's still in quadrant one this is still in quadrant one just half of that quadrant what that means is sine was positive but cosine and tangent are also positive so we're going to pick the positive one because this angle this angle here alpha theta over two in our case is still in quadrant one i really hope that's making sense that if theta's in quadrant one half of theta or theta two is still in quadrant one that's not always the case so if you have something in quadrant let's say three half of that angle is not necessarily in quadrant three anymore it's probably in in quadrant two but we'll take a look at that so we want to generally i do it this way with our original definition of where the angle is to find out where half of that is it's probably the easiest way instead of drawing pictures it's nice is to do the algebraically now let's go ahead let's move on to our tangent so we're going to do tangent of double angle and tangent of a half of an angle so with tangent of two theta we're really just looking at the formula and our formula tells us that we're going to take and do two tangent theta over one minus tangent square theta and thankfully we know those things we spent some time to figure out tangent so tangent theta is four thirds we're just going to substitute so two times four thirds gives us eight thirds over one minus sixteen ninths that's four thirds squared so one minus sixteen ninths my goodness that would be nine ninths minus sixteen ninths that looks like negative seven ninths if we multiply by a common denominator or the lcd that's going to give us let's see 9 simplifies to three giving us three nine simplifies here giving us negative seven so we get 24 over negative seven you'll also notice something about this that with your double angle formulas the signs of them not sign but signs like positive negative are taking care of themselves that's really interesting because half angle doesn't do that double angle does you see tangent is positive in quadrant one what's twice of something in quadrant one something in quadrant two well well from z from zero to pi over two so something generally in quadrant two so if we double that any any angle that relies where a double of it would be in quadrant two that negative sign will show up so double of this angle would be in quadrant two it says tangent is negative in quadrant two and that shows up cosine is negative in quadrant two that shows up sine is positive in quadrant 2. that shows up as well just be careful to not make some assumptions if you have a very small angle and you double it it's not necessarily in quadrant 2. so sometimes you you have positive sometimes you have negative for cosine and tangent what i'm telling you is that the signs will take care of themselves do not worry about the signs for double angle they will work themselves out it's the half angle ones and you see it in the formula those are the ones that you have to worry about so let's wrap this up with tangent of theta over two we have a formula for it we're going to use the formula we'll determine the sign in just a little bit so tangent of theta over two says we're going to take plus or minus the square root of one minus cosine theta over one plus cosine theta i suppose i've memorized it just by looking here and here i know that tangent is sine over cosine so i know that sine is going to be this minus and cosine is going to give us that plus so that's why i memorized the formulas the sine over the cosine now we just plug in what cosine theta is because we already know it's three-fifths we just substitute that so one minus three fifths is two fifths over one plus three this is eight fifths thankfully those denominators cancel we get one-fourth two over eight is one-fourth also thankfully that simplifies square root of one gives us one square root of four gives us two so we get plus or minus one-half now it's up to us to determine which one of those we take do we take the positive or the negative you look at your quadrant because theta over two is somewhere between zero and pi over four that's what that says it literally says that zero to pi over four is still in quadrant one tangent is positive in quadrant one if you want to take the positive version so tangent of theta over two is one half these can take a lot of time obviously i'm walking you through these verbally so it's taking us a little bit longer but in general this is the way you go through it you figure out your trig functions first if you're required to find all of these pieces if not maybe just find the ones that you actually need so like if we were working on a long problem they wanted to know what uh what cosine theta over two is cosine theta over two has nothing to do with sine or tangent you would not find it we just need to know what quadrant we lie in what half of the quadrant is then you just have one formula used that's pretty nice i'm going to come back with one more example of an angle that's not in quadrant one then we'll go through some identities and and do some equations let's keep on going so we have another one which at first glance is kind of awkward because you have cosecant cosecant this side has to do with cosecant what the world do we do and then you have cosine theta is negative or less than zero this is what they're trying to tell you with this they're trying to give you sine and tell you a quadrant so in order to find a quadrant you need to know the value or sign of two different trig functions so you need to know whether two different trig functions are both positive both negative or once positive one's negative that will determine the quadrant for you so that's what they're really trying to show you here um but it's kind of wrapped up in some stuff so if you're given a cosecant but everything you have to deal with is in sines and cosines change it if cosecant theta equals negative square root 5 then sine theta is the reciprocal sine theta has to be negative 1 over square root 5. if we rationalize that's going to be negative square root 5 over 5. so what have they just told you here they've told you that sine is negative furthermore sine of theta is negative square root of five over five they've also told you that cosine is negative cosine's less than zero so where is both sine and cosine negative well in quadrant one sine is positive so that's on the table in quadrant two sine is positive that's off the table in quadrant four cosine is positive sine is negative but in quadrant three both sine and cosine are negative so what they're telling you all hidden in this is that cosine's negative sine's negative the only place that happens is quadrant three so what they're telling you is that your angle theta is somewhere in quadrant three however don't just write quadrant three while that's important in order to deal with some of this the half angle it's very very useful to say hey if we're in quadrant three then our angle is somewhere between pi and three pi over 2. specifically it's not actually equal to there it's somewhere between there that is what quadrant 3 is from pi to 3 pi over 2. so we know we're somewhere in that quadrant because sine and cosine are both negative now because we know that we can write this or draw this picture of this angle really clearly so with our sine theta being negative square root 5 over 5 you could have done it here might have been a little bit easier even to consider this to be y and this to be r remember that we want our x's and y's to be negative but we do want our r's to be positive so wherever you go from here whether this is y and this is r or this is y and this is r you'll get it you'll get the same proportion for x so what we want to do is write this as negative 1 for y but square root 5 for r now what if you had chosen negative square root 5 for y and positive 5 for r while your x would be different the proportions u of cosine and tangent they would not be different so it doesn't really matter i'm using this because i like the one so either one of these it doesn't matter your cosine and tangent will come out the same either way you go so not to worry about that so i'm picking negative 1 for y and square root 5 for r again you want your y to be negative that it is your r to be positive it is giving us the sine of theta being a negative negative 1 over square root 5 or negative square root 5 over 5. from there we've got to find the x so we're going to do that we'll use pythagorean theorem and find the x so we'd have x squared plus negative 1 squared equals square root 5 squared if we do just a little bit of simplification here square root of five squared is five if we subtract the one x squared is four let's take a square root now which one do you pick that's where your quadrant comes in so if we're in quadrant two that's we've drawn this picture we can see it we can literally see that x has to be negative there you have to pick negative 2 and not positive 2. now that we've done that we can find our cosine and we can find our tangent it had told us cosine's negative oh we're seeing that now negative 2 would give us a negative cosine here because r is r is positive so that we know if i write the negative that cosine is negative tangent is also tangents positive so let's go ahead and find cosine and tangent of theta cosine says take your x over your r so we have negative 2 over square root 5. tangent says take your x o take your y over x so that's negative 1 over negative 2. and we can simplify that a little bit yeah we really should rationalize that so we should get negative 2 square root 5 over 5 and we should get positive 1 one-half now that we've done that we're ready to go and find all of our double angles because we have sine we've got cosine we've got tangent and our half angles because we have sine cosine tangent of whatever that angle is and we know that angle is in quadrant three which will allow us to figure out what half of the angle is and then the sine of that that angle so we'll come back and we'll do that all right so let's get to it now that we've found sine cosine and tangent for whatever angle we've been given let's find the rest of our double angle and half angle formulas so let's take a look at sine of two theta since there's only one double angle formula for sine we really have to use 2 sine theta cosine theta again you can't just pull the 2 out the only way to change arguments of a trig function is really to use an identity like the formulas you've been given so i always write out the formulas instead of just doing them in my head or writing down what the the fractions are for sine theta and cosine theta just so i can memorize them i'm used to them and i can i can follow what's what's really happening so sine of 2 theta equals 2 sine theta cosine theta i've written it out now it's really easy for me to look at what sine theta is as negative square root 5 over 5 and cosine theta as negative 2 square root 5 over 5. so i'm going to write that down so we have let's see 2 times negative square root 5 times negative 2 square root of 5 over 5 times 5. so it looks like we've got positive 4 times 5 over 25 and multiply everything together this times this gives us five that gives us four so we're going to have 20 over 25. so if we simplify that sine of two theta equals four fifths now what do you do with cosine two theta you have three options so if we want to use a double angle formula cosine squared minus sine squared theta is pretty common to use none of them are super difficult but it does depend on what you've been given as to maybe make it easier so if you were just given sine theta and you wanted to find cosine two theta you wouldn't have to do any work if you use the one identity that's one minus two sine squared theta you just plug that right in there square it take one minus two times that and you'd be done whatever way you want to go about it sometimes these different formulas are more appropriate depending on what you've been given so i'm going to do both i'm going to do the cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta now it's not all that hard but keep in mind that we had to actually find cosine theta in order to make that work so this will be negative 2 square root 5 over 5 squared minus negative square root 5 over 5 squared what that's going to give us is positive 4 times 5 so that's 20 over 25 minus this will give us positive 5 over 25 and what that means that cosine 2 theta is positive 15 over 25 or just three-fifths now i said sometimes it's easier depending on what you've been given so if we didn't want to have to spend the time to find cosine theta and all we were looking for was cosine 2 theta we might have used a different identity we might have used 1 minus 2 sine squared theta now does it still give us the same answer well let's find out if we did that notice we've been given sine theta it wouldn't have been all that hard to find so that's 1 minus 2 times negative square root 5 over 5 that's sine theta it's quantity squared well that's going to give us positive 5 over 25 times 2 that would be positive 10 over 25 so 25 over 25 minus 10 over 25 gives us 15 over 25. that's exactly what we get there it doesn't matter which formula you use but sometimes one of the formulas is a little bit more nicely suited to what you've been given so in this case you could have just used this formula and not had to find the cosine for that so either way you go you're going to do the same thing though so it's not a huge deal let's move on and go ahead and do our half angle formulas maybe before you start your half angle formulas it might be a good idea to figure out where this this angle actually is so the best way that i found to do this is draw your picture determine your your your quadrant but then take a look at the inequality version of that if you divide everything by two it will show you where theta over two your your half angle is so we're gonna do that so we know if we're in quadrant three we're between pi and three pi over two if we divide that by two you can see quadrant two word quadrant three so if we divide that by two this says that if your original angle is in quadrant three from pi to three pi over two and you cut that angle in half where are you going to be well pi divided by 2 is pi over 2 3 pi over 2 divided by 2 is 3 pi over 4. you're going to be somewhere between pi over 2 and 3 pi over 4. that's what that says so by writing your quadrant in inequality form finding half an angle is not all that bad just divide everything by two it says you are now between pi over two and three pi over four you are in quadrant two now so this angle half of an angle changes from quadrant 3 to quadrant 2. now that's really important because we know a few things about quadrant 2. we know that sine is positive we know cosine's negative we know that tangent is negative so when we get to our formulas right now we'll know the appropriate sign to take so let's take a look at sine of theta over two we know the sine of theta over two says you're going to take plus or minus one minus cosine theta all over 2. we know what cosine theta is we worked hard to find that that's negative 2 square root 5 over 5. it's pretty important to get the signs right so we know we have one minus but you do have that as a negative so cosine theta is negative be careful that's a really common mistake to make and now we're just going to simplify this so 1 minus negative 2 square root 5 over 5 is positive so 1 plus 2 square root 5 over 5. all over two if we find a common denominator that would be five over five so five plus two square root five all over five and then over 2. i'm going to write that out for you when you have this and you have a fraction divided by a number take and multiply these denominators so you have 5 plus 2 square root 5 over 5 over 2 if you reciprocate and multiply the 5 and the 2 end up getting multiplied together so you're going to have 5 plus 2 square root 5 over 10. now that's really nasty so what do you do you leave it there's nothing you can do to actually simplify that and get away from the exactness of the answer we don't really want to approximate this is def with decimals we want to leave that as exact the only thing we have to really determine is what to do to take the positive or the negative so we go back and we look at where our angle theta over two actually lies the original theta was in quadrant three we cut that angle in half we're now in quadrant two so in quadrant two sine is positive sine is positive in one and two so quadrant two says hey this angle is positive take the positive version of this we're just going to erase that we know that sine of theta over 2 is positive square root 5 plus 2 squared 5 over 10. it's ugly you could approximate it but leave it as an exact let's go ahead and move on and do cosine of theta over two so cosine of theta two is very very similar except you add instead of subtract so 1 plus cosine theta 2 you're seeing i'm still writing out the original formula before i start to substitute in some of these values that we know we know that cosine theta is negative two square root five so of one minus two square root five over five all over 2. so we find a common denominator again 1 over 1 or 1 minus 2 square root 5 over 5 i should say you can write this as 5 over 5. so 5 minus 2 square root 5 over 5. all over two we're gonna do the same thing that whole multiplied by the reciprocal or multiply your denominators we're going to get plus or minus square root 5 minus 2 square root 5 over 10. all that's left to do now is determine whether that's positive or negative so we take a look back at our quadrant we say that theta over two is in quadrant two we've already determined that by cutting this in half so theta became theta over two pi became pi over two three pi over two became three pi over four we're in quadrant 2. let's see sine is positive in quadrants 1 and 2 cosine is negative in quadrant 2. positive and 1 negative and 2. so if cosine is negative in quadrant 2 where that angle is then we're going to take the negative version of that square root so cosine theta over 2 equals negative square root 5 minus 2 square root 5 over 10. it's a lot of work to do as far as the simplification goes some of the times but honestly we're just following the formulas the biggest thing that i said at the beginning is the quadrant determine your your trig functions uh in in the appropriate quadrant and then determine the quadrant of theta over two all right let's go ahead and do tangent of two theta the double angle formula for tangent we've got a couple ways to do this so i didn't show this on the last last example but i really want you to see it now the first way we do this is with our our original formula so tangent of two theta gives us two tangent theta over one minus tangent squared theta now because we spend some time to find tangent theta this is not a big deal tangent theta is just one half so we're going to plug in one half here of course we'll square that on the denominator two times one half that is tangent theta for the appropriate angle in the correct quadrant two times tangent theta is two times one half over one minus tangent squared theta which is one half squared two times one half is just one over one minus one fourth so one minus one fourth is three-fourths or this whole thing one divided by three-fourths is four-thirds and so it tells us tangent of two theta is just four thirds now could you have done that differently yeah you could if you remember that tangent equals sine over cosine well what that means is that tangent of two theta should equal sine of two theta over cosine of two theta tangent always equals sine over cosine for whatever the angle is so this would equal sine of 2 theta over cosine of 2 theta but wait a minute sine of 2 theta is there cosine of 2 theta is there so if you want to do this a different way if you've already found sine of 2 theta you've already found cosine 2 theta just take sine divided by cosine simplified we get four fifths over three fifths 20 over 25 simplifies to four-fifths so four-fifths over three-fifths if you multiply by the reciprocal there so four-fifths times five-thirds the fives are going to cancel you are going to get exactly four-thirds and that would just be taking sine over cosine do it a number of ways any way is right as long as you're using an appropriate identity that gives you what you're looking for there's often times many ways to do it okay so let's take a look at tangent of theta over two the half-angle formula for tangent what we're going to do is basically take a look at this formula and this formula and the twos cancel so tangent is always a sine over cosine idea that's that's where it comes from and so we're going to take square root plus or minus square root of 1 minus cosine theta over one plus cosine theta cosine theta is negative 2 square root 5 over 5. so we're going to put that in both places so 1 minus a negative it's going to give us 1 plus 2 square root 5 over 5 divided by 1 minus 2 square root 5 over 5. with our common denominator of five there you can do a couple things you could find a common denominator here and here or you could multiply both the numerator and denominator by five but if you do that do not forget that you have to distribute to that one i'm going to show you that right now but either way you go you can put this as one fraction over one fraction or you can multiply by the lcd as long as you distribute here and here so 5 plus 2 square root 5 over 5 minus 2 square root 5. the 5's cancel on the second fraction now as far as simplifying there is technically one more thing you do you could multiply by the conjugate of the denominator and make this a little bit uh nicer so we could take some time to do that depending on on who your teacher is or what you're working on they might they might or might not do that so i'm actually not going to you could rationalize and make it a little bit simpler but in our case right now we just have to determine whether we take the positive or negative so we look back at our theta over 2. theta 2 is in quadrant 2. well what's tangent in quadrant two tangent is negative so we're going to take the negative square root of that that about does it for our double and half angle formulas just working through some of the basics what i'm going to do now is show you why you might want to know this for some very awkward angles to get exact solutions without having to approximate then we'll talk about two identities so we'll talk about two equations and then we'll be done all right so we got a couple examples that illustrate that sometimes these identities these formulas help us to find exact answers of angles that are not on your unit circle so this is quite valuable if you have to find an exact answer like cosine of 22.5 degrees that's not our unit circle so here's the thought process could you use either a double angle or a half angle formula to rewrite this as a better angle or at least one that's on your unit circle so i might i might think 22.5 looks like an angle that's cut in half it actually looks like like half of 45 degrees so so wait a minute maybe i can write this as half of 45 degrees instead of 22.5 so if i write this as cosine of 45 over 2 notice 45 over 2 that's still 22.5 degrees but if i write this as 45 over 2 degrees well that's a half angle formula that's something that we can use because because when we have an angle over 2 well our formula says that we can take and use this angle in that formula remember that the half angle says plus or minus square root of 1 plus cosine theta over two the only question is what is your theta now we've been doing a lot of examples but if you remember it was theta over two here's why the half angle formula is so nice if you can write this as an angle over 2 you get to use that angle over there cosine of 45 degrees is really nice for us to use that square root 2 over 2 but this is the reason why we want to use this sometimes is so that you can get away from doing this and say hey i can use a half angle formula and really think of it as 45 degrees because of that formula so we're going to say this is plus or minus square root of 1 plus cosine 45 degrees over two that's much easier or at least possible to find an exact answer that one's not so much because 22.5 degrees is on the unit circle here we go hey cosine 45 degrees go to my unit circle looks like square root two over two one plus square root two over two that would be two over two plus square root two over two so that's two plus square root two over two so common denominator here you could also multiply both the numerator and denominator by two and as long as you distribute just be sure that you're doing that and you could get two plus square root two over four we're going to actually get the same exact thing here we're going to get 2 plus square root 2 2 divided by 2. well 2 plus square root 2 over 2 divided by 2. multiply your denominators multiplied by the reciprocal multiplies your denominators so either way we go about it whether you want to do it that way or whether you want to multiply both the numerator and denominator by the lcd and distribute two twos cancel here over four get the same exact thing the only thing that's left for us is to determine whether that's positive or negative so you you have to think back to your angle now because we're given a specific angle we're given 22.5 degrees where is that well that's in quadrant one or where's 45 over two wait a minute that is 22.5 degrees that's in quadrant one think about cosine in quadrant one cosine quadrant one is positive so take the positive and you're done so that's one way that we can use these half-angle formulas to find an exact answer not just approximation but exact answer for an angle that we don't really have on a unit circle we're going to do the same thing with tangent of 9 pi over 8 but there is one thing about this i want you to notice that angle is outside of the first period of tangent so tangent goes from 0 to pi that's its first period 9 pi over 8 is just outside that anytime that happens like if you saw 5 pi over 2 inside of sine or cosine you might want to put this on the first period so we can always do this by subtracting or adding any number of periods to this like 9 pi over 8 i'm probably thinking let's subtract pi why because it moves it from from quadrant 3 in quadrant 1 it's a little bit nicer to deal with even though tangent is is positive in both of those it's just a little bit nicer so any what i'm saying is that anything outside of the first period of your trig function you can always subtract some periods to get into one period so since the period of tangent is pi let's subtract pi what that means is that if we find tangent of pi over eight it's going to be identical to tangent of 9 pi over 8 and that's nice it's a little easier to deal with but then comes the hiccup you go wait a minute that's not on my unit circle either i know it's in quadrant one think about why that is if you cut pi into eight please pieces so one two three four and five six seven eight and you go to one of them you are in quadrant one so tangent is going to be positive so when we deal with our formula our half-angle formula which you're going to get a little bit we're going to take the positive square root but pi over rate's not on anything so how in the world could you could you think about that well pi over 8 looks like half of some other angle or an angle pi over four pi over eight is half of pi over four if you took pi over 4 and divided by 2 you get pi over 8. therefore pi over 8 is a half of an angle of that and that is what we need to use in our formula that's what makes it so nice so we're going to write out our formula just keep in mind that angle that theta is this thing you we're really kind of tricking the problem we're thinking of this as half of some other angle it's that angle that you get to use which is what makes this all possible anyway so we're going to use pi over 4. we've actually done that haven't we because cosine of 45 degrees and cosine pi over 4 power 4 is 45 degrees we're going to get that square root 2 over 2 again in this case i would certainly multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2 getting rid of that lcd as long as we distribute so 2 times 1 gives us 2 square root 2 over 2 times 2 is just square root 2. something very similar happens here we get 2 plus square root 2. we could rationalize the denominator multiply both of these by 2 minus square root 2 over 2 minus square root 2 and distribute that would work but in our case i'm not going to do that it's just a little bit more than i want to spend time on right now what i will do though is is look at the sign so because tangent of pi over four over two or pi over eight you're looking at pi over eight that gives you your quadrant that's quadrant one tangent is positive in quadrant one we'll take just the positive version that square root you never leave both positive and negative four for these half-angle formulas so i hope that's made sense we're going to come back with two very fast identities then we'll do three equations pretty quickly and then we'll be done okay we're about to go through two identities because it's really good to remember these things you deal with identities many many times especially in calculus too when we deal with a lot of trigonometry in some things called integrals so we're going to get there so right now we're going to refresh just on how how proven identities works remember that what we want to do is start on like the harder side and there's lots of different things that we we deal with but one of the main concepts was look at the harder side look to see if there are any identities right there if there are take care of it if there's not see everything's in sines and cosines make one fraction maybe factor if you can so let's go ahead let's start with this guy cosine to the fourth theta minus sine to the fourth theta equals cosine of two theta i think the harder sides of this side so i'm going to start there i'm looking at that that's how well there's there's not more than one fraction so i can't make everything one fraction i don't see an identity that's right there popping up at me everything's in sines and cosines um i might try to factor this because i'm i'm seeing this as kind of like oh man it's kind of like a difference of squares it's something squared or cosine squared squared minus sine squared squared so it's lack of difference of squares maybe i'll write it like that now that we've written this as a difference of squares difference of squares can factor do you remember that it's very similar to x squared minus y squared and you write this as x minus y and x plus y that's a difference of squares factoring we're about to do exactly the same thing it's just that we have this squared minus this squared first thing squared minus second thing squared how it works we take cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta times cosine squared theta [Music] plus sine squared theta i'm really hoping that you see the similarity here it's just a difference of squares this stuff is first thing squared minus second theta squared just like x squared minus y squared we just take our cosine squared minus sine squared cosine squared plus sine squared as a product of one another so after that what do you do don't factor again that's what you don't do don't factor again you see the thing about proven identities is we want to make sure that we're always checking for a known identity like after everything that we do so i don't want to start going and factoring that that doesn't factor but i certainly don't want to factor that the reason why is because if we're checking for identities oh this is this is a beautiful one cosine squared plus sine squared theta is one that's the pythagorean identity so this is just one what about this one cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta if we have our identity sheet next to us or we're really used to the double angle identities this is one of the double angle identities formulas for cosine so cosine two theta there was three double angle formulas for cosine the first one was exactly what we see here so that that's a big point that these formulas they're not just one way they go both ways so if you have cosine two theta sure you could write it as cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta but on the other hand if you have cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta like that you could also write that as cosine two theta now that's perfect because cosine two theta times one is cosine two theta and we've just started with the hard side we've done some factoring we used some identities and we've ended with what we wanted to prove so that states it and that's it so we've just proven that identity how about the next one this is super similar very very similar because we're going to use the same exact formula we see right here that that is a difference of squares but if you notice it's also this right here so you go wait a minute that doesn't have two theta in it that just has theta in it yeah but we can do the same thing so keep in mind what happens cosine 2 theta equals cosine squared theta minus sine squared then here's what this this really says it says cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta is you can write this thing as cosine of two times whatever that angle is cosine squared theta minus center of theta is cosine of two times whatever that angle is as long as they're the same which they are so what about that this can be written as cosine of two times whatever that angle is which is two theta wait a second we started the hard side we saw an identity right off the bat we've used it and now cosine of 2 times 2 theta 2 times 2 theta is 4 theta and that's exactly what we're trying to prove that proves our identity so about these identities now that we have more tricks in our bag we don't it actually makes things a lot easier um so when we see an identity right off the bat you can go for it a lot of times there's some factoring involved but keep with the same kind of core features of how to solve identities number one if you have fractions you get one fraction use known identities anytime you can and immediately after you do something check check for an identity there factoring is always a good tool if you're getting stuck and then remember that identities are not just one-way streets they're they're two-way streets we can go forward we can go backwards on them it oftentimes helps with a lot of things that we deal with last little bit we've got three equations that we're going to solve they're going to go fairly quickly but you're going to notice something about this there's an appropriate choice for some of these double angle formulas that you have to make so we're going to take a look firstly at cosine of two theta plus sine six sine squared theta equals four um when we deal with these often times the worst part of this is the double angle you see that that doesn't play along very nicely with things that aren't double angle and so typically the way these equations work is find the double angle use the appropriate formula to get away from that double angle and then almost always we have some sort of a factoring involved so cosine 2 theta i don't i don't really like it the sine squared theta i i don't really want to change that i don't want to change that into a double angle because they're a little bit harder to deal with so maybe i'll look in here and change that out of a double angle now which one do we use because we know that we have three different formulas for cosine two theta this kind of goes back to an identity idea look at what else you have like what else is outside of that if you have a choice of once you make that what's the best choice would you want to see more cosines or would you want to see more signs here's a sine squared so wait a minute if i use the cosine squared sine squared that might not cancel that all the way and then i have another cosine squared that's growing larger not getting better if i use the 1 minus 2 sine squared oh well i could combine some like terms so that would be a great choice let's use that one let's use the one that identifies with the the trig function we already have so we've taken a look at it we said i really don't like double angles let's change that first but i'm going to use the appropriate one that matches what i already have one minus two sine squared theta looks like a good choice because i already had some sines where theta is up there now we can combine some like terms and once we do we see 1 plus 4 sine squared theta just combine like terms hey there's only one trig function left if we isolate that we can take a square root both sides so we'll subtract 1 and divide by four so we work all the way down to sine squared theta equals positive 3 4. remember that sine squared theta means sine theta squared so you have your variable inside of a function to a second power the whole thing's to second power you can take a square root but if you do it you've got to remember to take it on both sides and you have to put that plus and minus we see that we get this sine theta equals plus or minus square root 3 over 2. now square root of 3 over 2 is a great number it's on our unit circle but just remember that you have to find out all the solutions on 0 to 2 pi that equal either positive square root of 3 over 2 or negative so sometimes i'll do this i'll write this out as two different equations find sine theta equals positive square root of three over two and sine theta equals negative square root of three over two just so i don't get confused and the reason why i'm doing that is you can hopefully you can see that on zero to two pi you're going to have two angles that give you this and two angles will give you that there's gonna be four angles here so we walk through this we think about where is sine theta equal to positive square root of three over two that would be quadrant one and quadrant two sine is positive in one and two where would sine theta equal negative square root of two that's quadrants three and four signs negative and three and four so we're gonna get theta equals pi over three and two pi over three so where's sine theta equal negative square root of three over two that's in quadrants three and four so let's see pi over three two over three then at four pi over three and at five pi over three we would get angles that give us a y coordinate of negative square root of three over two so all in all there's four angles that satisfy this equation there's four angles that give us either a y coordinate of positive or negative square root of three over two and that's all of our solutions on one rotation around that that unit circle or from zero to two pi so i hope that makes sense hope you're seeing really the the uh the necessity of changing our double angle into something that relates relates to what we have already that's the appropriate choice to make is something that matches up with what you have otherwise we might be going in circles for a little while if we pick the wrong thing here so be very careful on what you're picking make sure it's matching what you have all right let's look at the next one we got cosine of two theta equals cosine of our forgotten theta equals cosine of theta now what do you do here i really want you to think through this on your own don't pause the video but think about what i'm i'm asking you to do look at the piece that is difficult to deal with hopefully in your head it's the cosine 2 theta now cosine 2 theta that's a double angle that has three different formulas which one matches up best with what you have already would you want to see signs or would you want to see cosines well if you already have a cosine you can change this into one of three things you can change it into cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta you can change it into one minus two sine squared theta or you can change into two cosine squared theta minus one which one matches up with what you have over here well probably not the stuff with signs in it so maybe i choose the double angle formula for cosine that has to do with cosine and just cosine that's going to give us 2 cosine squared theta minus 1. so where do we go from there well at this point i hope you're noticing that the format of this you've got a power 2 cosine you get a power 1 cosine you get a constant this is a really good opportunity for us to factor so let's get everything on one side and let's see if we can factor this so we've got things on one side in order we've kept our first term positive the first term is the term of the largest power and so in our case we want to keep that power 2 cosine keep that positive i hope it's making sense that we want to pick the thing that matches what we have that lets factoring happen a lot easier that's a lot of other combined like terms happen so when we look at this and say which one do we choose oftentimes it's based on what we have outside of that double angle like here we had sine squared we want to combine some like terms pick the stuff aside not cosine here we have just the cosine pick this up with just cosine and not sine now that we have this this could be an opportunity for a substitution you could call cosine theta equal to u you have something raised to the second power something raised to the first power and it's the same something call that u or some other dummy variable so we get 2 u squared minus u minus 1. we've talked about substitutions a lot in this series and in past series it just lets you factor easier it lets you change things that look hard to factor into things that are easy so two u squared minus u minus one is pretty easy for us to see that we can factor that we'd have negative one negative two looks like we'd get negative two and positive one if we wanna divide by our a and simplify you can factor this as one u minus 1 over times 2u plus 1. or you could just straight up solve this right now if you change these signs that will solve your u so you could put down here u equals positive 1 u equals negative one half and you're done uh so if all we're looking for is the solution not the factoring you can go right from here as long as you've divided by your a first that works if not if you like the factory better you can do two u plus one one u minus one equals zero and you can probably see this two u plus one equals zero would give you negative one half uh u minus one equals zero would give you positive one we're not done but we're very close remember that we use this substitution here so what is u really u is really cosine theta so if u equals one that means cosine theta equals one and if u equals negative one-half that means cosine theta equals negative one-half could you have just factored from here yeah that's fine if the substitution is not necessary for you you can easily factor this as 2 cosine theta plus 1 and cosine theta minus 1. that's fine too it doesn't really matter i'm just giving you another option what isn't optional is solving this the rest of the way so we take a look at our unit circle cosine theta equals 1. so what angle gives you an x coordinate of one that's got to be zero so cosine theta equals one only when theta equals zero notice that we don't allow this to get two pi so it's just at zero cosine theta equals negative one-half at two places in quadrants two and three because cosine is the x-coordinate the x-coordinate is negative in quadrants two and three and will equal an x coordinate of one half negative one half i should say at let's see um two pi over three and four pi over three if you look at your unit circle we're just finding out where cosine theta equals negative one half you're going to find 2 pi over 3 and 4 pi over 3. and those are all the solutions on one revolution of the unit circle or from 0 to 2 pi that satisfy that equation okay last one so we have 2 sine of 2 theta equals cosine theta we really want to change some double angles they're difficult to deal with when we deal with other things that don't have a double angle so like when we have sine of two theta and cosine theta the two theta makes it very difficult for us to manipulate that because if you have different angles they're hard to combine they're hard to factor you can't factor them you can't pull the two out you can't do anything with a double angle if you have other angles that are not 2 theta that's why we were changing all the double angles into the appropriate formula so now when we get sine of 2 theta equals cosine theta we have to change that sine of 2 theta now this is really good news because there's only one formula for a double angle for sine so sine of 2 theta only equals one thing and you really have to use it so you don't have to choose anything this is only going to equal 2 sine theta cosine theta for the last time you don't just need to pull the two out the only way you change arguments and trig functions is with identities the identity for a double angle for sine says you can change this as long as you do sine of 2 times sine of theta cosine theta since there's only one formula it's the one that we have to use now what do you do well this looks like it could be another factoring issue because i have something with a cosine and i have a cosine over here so maybe we start getting everything on one side to see if we can factor equations usually work that way when you have two different terms with the same same function or the same variable or one squared and one's not let's see if factoring works let's get everything on one side one thing to be cautious of i've seen it from time to time doesn't happen often but don't start dividing both sides by something to eliminate it because what happens is you'll start to eliminate some of your solutions so if we divided both sides by cosine theta sure it would cancel out but you're going to eliminate some solutions and you're also technically divided by something that could equal zero and so you do run into some demand issues there so don't do that get everything on one side and see if you can factor it so if we have two sine theta cosine theta minus cosine theta hey you've got two terms they both have cosine data in them let's let's factor that out now that we've factored all when we have a zero you can use a zero product property for this so because you have two pieces multiplied together equals zero either cosine theta equals zero or two sine theta minus one equals zero now that's already solved we're just going to have to find the angle that gives us an x coordinate of 0. here we'll add 1 and divide by 2 we'll isolate that sine theta and on the interval from 0 to 2 pi the only place where we have an x coordinate of 0 is at pi over 2 and at 3 pi over 2 so we hit x coordinate of 0 at pi over 2 and then again at 3 pi over 2 so this has two solutions the only place where we have a y coordinate of one half on the unit circle happens at pi over six and at five pi over six so we'd certainly want our unit circle handy to be able to find out if cosine theta equals zero we're really just asking what angle gives us an x coordinate because cosine is the x coordinate circle of zero and that's pi over 2 3 3 pi over 2. what angle on the unit circle gives us a y coordinate of one half because sine theta is the y coordinate on the unit circle that happens at pi over 6 and 5 pi over 6. so i hope this has made sense i hope i've walked you through enough examples to illustrate the use of a double angle and a half angle formula when to use them what they look like especially in in identities and some of these equations on how to do that these can get pretty confusing but remember that the double angle piece is typically the piece we want to get rid of usually not always but usually with cosine we just want to pick the right one that matches the rest of our stuff either to combine like terms or that makes factoring possible so i hope that helps you hope you've enjoyed the videos and we'll see you for next time for a couple different identities that we'll make you
