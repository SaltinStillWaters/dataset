Transcript for: Introduction to Polynomial Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 27)
hey everybody welcome to another video we are going to start talking about polynomials and polynomial driven functions like rational functions for a very long time and so in this video i just want to refresh what a polynomial is and some of the vocabulary we'll be using as we go into the future stuff so it's very short video there's not much to do this except for kind of recapping what you should know about polynomials if you don't that's okay i'm going to tell you right now so we're going to talk about what polynomials are some of the verbiage that we use what are not polynomials and then how we really want to see them so next few videos will unpack what all we we do with polynomials especially from the aspect of how do you graph them or better yet maybe a picture of the polynomial in your head like a sketch so you can interpret what it means and get into calculus that's really important so what polynomials are and we're going to go with it polynomials are these kind of creatures in math where we have several terms poly being this sort of mini and and no meal or non this this uh this sort of name or term and so what a polynomial is is several terms it doesn't have to be several it can be just one term but typically it's several terms that are combined with addition and subtraction so you're going to notice on the board right away that that looks really confusing you go that looks like a whole bunch of garbage yeah i get it but it's just one of the ways that we can show what a polynomial will look like eventually so what polynomials are are these these math expressions in this case we have a function so we have a function we're talking about polynomial functions these math expressions from here to here that are connected with addition or subtraction you know well that all looks like addition that's true but if we had coefficients that are negative we would write that as subtraction so this is the way we structure a polynomial so we can kind of wrap up all the cases in one so what does it mean firstly i want you to notice that these a's have different subscripts and they match these exponents so the exponents n and n minus 1 n minus 2 and then all the way down until you get to a 2 a 1 and then no exponent above an x has no x at all at the very end which is a constant term that's how we want to structure our polynomials we want them in order that's one of the notes that we have up there is that exponents need to be in descending order so you want your biggest exponent first it's pretty important because it does a few things for you my kind of spoiler alert here there shouldn't be any spoilers in in math like you should know what you're getting out of it we want these in order for a number of reasons number one our leading term which is what this is we'll talk about that in just a second our leading term tells us a tremendous amount about the polynomial and most importantly what it looks like graphically we are going to get end behavior from our leading term we're going to get the degree which gives us end behavior from our leading term the degree also tells us how many zeros we have if we include complex numbers so it's pretty powerful also we want our constant to be at the end the reason why we want to do that is because if we have a constant you can't just factor out an x if you don't have a constant you can which is pretty cool so it means it's automatically factorable if you don't have a constant if you do have a constant you're going to want to know what that is because if you can't factor this easily or use something like quadratic formula for degree 5 and higher polynomials there is no such thing as a formula to give you zeros doesn't it doesn't exist up to power four there is but it's extremely difficult and it takes a lot of time and so we have something called the rational zeros theorem and you're going to want to know what's your leading coefficient that's the number in front of your living term and what your constant is because if you know those two things i can teach you what the rational zeros are going to be if you don't know those two things you have to search for them it just it's cumbersome so those are some of the reasons why we want our polynomial in order by descending exponents so this n this n minus 1 n minus 2 all the way down to 2 1 and nothing at all we want that to be descending so n obviously is our largest one n minus 1 and now you might be asking the question well wait a minute are we am i always going to have a polynomial where it's like x to the fifth and x to the fourth and x to the second no you're not and that's why we have a coefficient in front of every one of these is because sometimes we can consider those coefficients to be zero and then it takes that whole term and it wipes it out so that's one of the reasons why we structured this way is to make room for every possible polynomial it looks confusing they're honestly not all that bad but that's what that means and sometimes i've seen students just look at that and go i'm never going to get this yeah you will it's not it's really not that bad it's just telling you that hey you have a lot of terms yeah they're going to be added and subtracted we want them in order so we want our biggest exponent first and then descending to our smallest these coefficients they're the numbers in front of our terms they match up to our specific uh our specific specific exponents so this would be the coefficient that matches up with this this exponent coefficient here can some of your coefficients be zero yes they can be zero and that would annihilate these entire terms so that means that you don't have to have an exponent on for every possible case below your largest power which is also your degree so that's what those are for now a couple couple key words that we have uh the first one you've heard me explain it probably define it already is called the leading term if you have this in order then your leading term is going to be the term with the largest exponent it should be your first term if you've done it in order shouldn't it i mean it's got to be in order right you want the biggest one first and the leading term is the term with the largest exponent that's why it's in the front your leading term is a sub n x to the n and those that right there it's really the only um coefficient that we don't want to be zero because you should start somewhere and so this leading term is what they're talking about they're saying hey you know what it's going to be the term with the largest power that's what the leading term means it should be the first one because you should be writing these polynomial functions in order and we already talked about why it's really important that's going to give us end behavior that's going to give us the degree it's going to give us the number of maximum turning points if you subtract 1 from the degree it's going to give us the number of zeros if you include complex numbers there there's a whole lot this gives us and it's going to be part of with our leading coefficient that's the number in front of our leading term there not including the x that's going to give us the rational zeros theorem so pretty important the constant term should be last it's the only one without an x on it if you notice our x's are going to have exponents that that sort of expire uh by the end of it do you have to have a constant no i've talked about that you don't have to have a constant but if you do it should be last so a sub 0 is our constant term we wouldn't consider it to be a coefficient because it's not a variable term variable terms are terms that have variables in it and we have lots of terms in polynomials there should be only one constant term why well because constants are always like terms so if you have more than one constant term you could add it and you see that a lot in like differential equations calculus things like that or if you have a couple constants you add them together and you call them a different constant if you don't know exactly what it is so we should only have one constant term in our polynomial functions like that now the degree what your degree is our degree is the largest exponent that appears in your polynomial it should always be the exponent of your leading term because hey that's the term of the biggest power that should be in the front that's what your degree is so our our degree here is n i'm going to write out right now that it's just the the largest power that is included in your polynomial what you don't do what you don't do is you don't just go add up all your exponents it's very common for students to do that because you're going to see i'm going to teach you a way to sort of fake distribute to find the degree it's pretty cool it's really easy it's going to save you a ton of time especially when you have these really super factored polynomials and you need to find the end behavior well it's really annoying to have to distribute that so i'll show you a way to do that but i caution you here all you're really looking for is look at your leading term pick out the biggest exponent that you see up there it should be in your leading term otherwise that order and that is your degree so i'm going to put and what i'm going to say is this is just the largest exponent in the polynomial and again it tells us a lot about it we've already talked about that i'm not going to recap it here but moving forward we really need to know what the degree is helps us out a lot so um just to run down one more time polynomial means many terms they're always separated by pluses and minuses that's what creates terms for us so you're going to see pluses and minuses you don't have to have more than one term to define a polynomial but most of the time they are more than one term we want the exponents in order descending biggest is smallest that means our first term is always the one with our biggest exponent called our leading term it gives us a lot of information our degree is the exponent of our leading term the number in front is our leading coefficient the coefficient of our leading term and the constant term should be last if we have one so we're going to take a look right now we've really already talked about the second note that i have that these these polynomials need to be in order of descending exponents we're going to look through some that are some that aren't and then all of the exponents and polynomials have to be positive or zero so basically non-negative integers that means whole numbers what that means for us is we can't have any fractional exponents no rational exponents so there's no square roots in polynomials have we dealt with those before well yeah but this is about polynomials it's our our kind of most basic type of function we start with it here because they're easiest to graph so that's why we're doing it so that we we understand the graphs of polynomials and we can make inferences about rationals we make inferences about these other things based on that but we've got to start somewhere so polynomials do not have fractional exponents you're like that's nice it is nice it means we don't have anything really nasty our our domain is really easy it's just all real numbers because there's nothing crazy about polynomials we don't have any negative exponents that means that we don't have like a number with a variable on the denominator why because that would give us asymptotes so with polynomials our domain is all real numbers all the time and that's fantastic we're going to get into end behavior a little while in a different video but that's that's really nice to know that that our polynomials do not give us any domain issues so you might want to write that down that our domain for polynomials is all real numbers as soon as we start putting radicals logarithms and denominators that have variables inside of them we oftentimes get domain problems we get these uh these issues that say hey you can only be positive that's logarithms you can be positive including zero that's square roots or fourth roots but not cube roots right you put negatives in there or you have hey you're dividing now by zero that's a vertical asymptote so when we do that we are going to start getting domain issues that's most of this class honestly is graphing by those domain issues which is pretty cool but for here for polynomials we don't have any of that stuff your domain is all real numbers your range is either negative infinity to positive infinity or infinite positive infinity to positive infinity or sorry zero to positive infinity unless you start shifting around but you you have this this range that's very predictable you have a domain that's very predictable it's all real numbers now let's look at this let's see which of these are actually polynomials we'll identify um the order we'll identify the leading term we'll identify the degree and then we'll identify which one of these are not polynomials so if we look at f of x this 5x squared plus x to the fourth well the first thing we're going to ask ourselves is is there anything that's making this not a polynomial because if it is we're really not going to talk about it yet so when you look at that are the exponents all positive so non-negative are they all integers yeah 2 and 4 look just fine there's no negative exponents there's no fractions with variables on the denominator that would be a negative exponent there are no rational so fractional exponents that would be like a radical so rational exponents give you square roots cube roots things like that so this is fine the only problem that i'm seeing here is this is not in order so a lot of times we spend just a second to get our polynomials in order this is a polynomial from the start but we just want it to be in order now let's talk a little bit about it now that this is in order and what we're talking about is not the coefficients i could not care less about the coefficients being in order it doesn't matter what matters is the exponent so the four and then the two i want those exponents to be descending as i go from term to term from left to right that's what we want so that's an order that looks really good you'll also notice that there's no power three here so could you write it as a power three i was talking about this a little while ago and this is important because when we get to dividing rationals or using long division of polynomials which i'll teach you is that you need a place for every potential power of x this is what i was talking about earlier is there a power 3 in here yes and no do you see it no could you write it yes if you wanted to you could give it a zero coefficient that is still the same polynomial four x to the fourth plus zero x to the third plus five x squared that zero hey you know about coefficients you know the coefficient is multiplied by whatever the variable is that's next it says no matter what you plug in that's zero because it's a term it's separated by pluses and minuses that zero would completely annihilate that term but you could write it and that's why this is written this way it's saying yeah yeah we have every power of x going down to none sure but a lot of those coefficients could be zero that's why that's there so here you go yeah i could write this do i need to in some cases yes here no not really but you just need to be aware that you could do it so let's erase that let's talk about this and say all right well since that's an order it has a leading term the leading term here would be 4 x to the fourth the entire term the leading coefficient is four the degree is also four that four it's the exponent so our exponent of our leaving term is called the degree tells us a lot about the function now the next term is 5x to the second power or 5x squared and our coefficient here would be 5. we do not have a constant term so that's a polynomial how about the next one how about g of x 3 minus 1 half x you know i see a fraction fractions are fine as long as they're not exponents that right there is a polynomial but it is out of order so when we write this in order we need our x terms no matter what they are to come in front of our co our constants and you'll notice i'm always taking the sine of the term with it so here we have negative one half x plus three that's a polynomial the leading term is negative one half x our exponents are decreasing this is x to the first power this is kind of weird but could you think of this as x to the zero power yes x to the zero power is not zero it's one anything to the zero power is one you have zero uh but you wouldn't we wouldn't consider that because we plugged in zero we'd get um we'd get a constant there so for any non-zero so we'd say all right well if i have x to the zero power that being one then this would still be 3. and so that right there because of that that case though we don't have we wouldn't say that that's a variable term we'd say yeah it's not there's not really an x there we would just consider that to be our constant so that's in order we'd say that our exponents are decreasing there's just none at the end our leading term is negative one half x to the first if you if you want right now you should be thinking of the degree the degree here is one the leading coefficient is negative one half and our constant is three let's look at a couple other ones these are often confusing but i want to make sure that you understand this are these polynomials and answers yes they are so h of x equals 9 is a polynomial even though there's one term if you remember i told you you don't have to have more than one term it's just often times you do however you don't have a variable here so 9 is just a constant term it is our leading term but it's not a variable term so we wouldn't say that 9 is the leading coefficient but what is our degree what we would say here is that our degree is 0. for the same reason i showed you earlier it doesn't really have an x it doesn't really have a variable if it did that exponent would have to be zero and so we would say this term this function is a constant function man you should see it right you see that's just a horizontal line at nine that's all that thing is our degree is zero now contrast that to the next one f of x equals zero you go well wait a minute this has this is actually constant the constant is not you yeah that's that's that's a non-zero constant its degree is zero because well if you had x to the zero power give you one sure and you'd still get nine back in this case if you have a function that equals zero you're going to say that that's no degree why why the difference why does why is this a degree zero but this one has no degree the zero is a very interesting interesting number it's this this multiplicative construct really that if you multiply it by anything it gives you zero so you take zero by any other number and you're going to get zero well what that means is that you could put any x over there and it's not necessarily going to matter what that exponent is you're going to get zero for that reason whether it's x to the third or actually the 31st you'd still get zero you could put any exponent up there and get the same thing that means that the exponent doesn't matter that degree could be anything and therefore we say it has no degree so when you have a zero function like h f of x equals zero in this case that has no degree because that is has um that constant right there that zero constant no matter what you multiplied it by as far as a variable is concerned it would end up being zero anyhow and so while we're not multiplying we can't say it has any specific degree because whatever the degree would be you'd say it would be zero so we say there's none does it super matter no not really uh the big things here that we're getting into minutia right now uh the big things here are that put it in order make sure you know what a leading term is make sure you know how to find the degree and then uh understand what the constant term is and that that's at the end how about the next one so f of x equals x to the three halves well that's weird as soon as you say that as soon as you see a fractional exponent what that is that is a square root of x to the third power that's a radical there are no radicals and polynomials so we'd say this is not a polynomial function we're not going to be talking about these right now there is a time and a place but it's not here we start getting domain issues out of radicals often times so we're not talking about that one this is not a polynomial how is this is this a polynomial and the answer is no if you have fractions with variables on the denominator and you can't get rid of them well those fractions with the variable denominator would end up being negative exponents you could write this as 1 minus 4 x to the negative 1 power remember that negative 1 here would become a fraction with x on the denominator to the first power this right here is not allowed for polynomials we're not going to be talking about it we will be talking about rational it's going to give us a vertical asymptote at zero that's going to be great but it's not here so polynomial sure positive exponents no problem following me here sure positive exponents that are not fractions here positive exponents yeah zero non-negative means including zero positive and zero so yeah here uh it's a weird one we say it has no degree it's a zero function uh how about x to the three halves positive yes but fractions are not allowed for polynomials here no negative exponents not allowed for polynomials how about the last one uh is a polynomial polynomials have only to do with the the way that our term is structured and the type of exponent we have so our exponent is 4 2 and then a constant those are not negative exponents and they're also not fractional exponents so even though it might look a little bit weird with pi minus pi x squared that's crazy this is still a polynomial is it an order yes the exponents four and then two and then your constant are in order that's fine so right now identify your leading term in your head you should be thinking my leading term is nine x to the fourth no problem our leading coefficient is nine and our degree is four that degree 4 is going to tell us that this polynomial is even it's an even based polynomial that end behavior is given by your leading term and your degree the next term is negative we include with the sign pi x squared where our our coefficient for that term is negative pi it's kind of awkward but that's okay and our constant term is one-half so that's in order it's a polynomial we have identified the leading term and the degree and that's great that's really all we want to be able to do what i'm going to do now is i'm going to put a couple more on the board that i really want to show you some some intricacies with okay so i had put up four more examples talking about whether or not these are polynomials because this can be a little bit confusing for some students they don't quite grasp what's going on here especially with the fractions and the radicals and how to find a leading term without actually distributing that's the cool part so let's look at this g of x right here is that a polynomial no it no it's not it's not going to be one but you need to do something before you make that determination so how we determine whether or not we have a polynomial is take and see if you can divide it and see what happens here now from its structure just at the beginning we'd say no this is actually a rational function rational is this idea of ratio fraction where you have a polynomial divided by another polynomial however sometimes we can cheat the system if we divide it and so we can we can find a domain and then divide the functions and treat it like a polynomial except for the case of missing some points in the domain we call those things holes so we'll talk about holes and asymptotes a whole is a removable discontinuity it means basically you're missing a point so why is that not a polynomial because it doesn't have any negative exponents right now that's positive that's positive however if you were to divide this and simplify it both of these denominators you can move as x to the negative 2 power and 5x to the negative 4 power so i say this way if you have any any fractions where you have variables on the denominator and you cannot simplify it completely away that thing right actually just from the start that's not a polynomial if you can simplify it you can treat it sort of like a polynomial we call it a removable discontinuity a whole i'll show you that later but this would not be a polynomial this is a rational function now the next one think about what i just told you if it's a fraction where you have variables on the denominator that is when you run into that i am a rational i'm not a polynomial this is a polynomial there's no variables on the denominator and if you were to simplify this if you write this as you could think of this as 3 7 x squared minus 1 7. hey it's in order our exponent is positive and that's a constant my leading term is 3 7 x squared my leading coefficient is 3 7 my degree is 2 and my constant is negative 1 7. that's certainly a polynomial you just can't make the jump until you really look at your denominator if you have variables down there no that's rational if you don't yes that is a polynomial and you can write it as a polynomial with these addition or subtraction of terms in order that's what we're looking for the last one right off the i mean you can look and say yeah man you got square roots everywhere and that's that's not a polynomial and you'd be right however just consider for a second if you were to distribute it perhaps those square roots go away perhaps you simplify them now i will tell you something that's very dangerous if you if you distribute and somehow it gets rid of your square roots it gets rid of your fraction does something where it changes the look of it you need to have found your domain first because in doing this it can make it appear that your domain changes your domain from the original function will not change for the better you can only make it worse it's not going to change for the better so if you start distributing this you go oh my domains all real numbers now but it wasn't before but it is now that's a problem so from the beginning we'd have this thing in our head like wait a minute square roots have to be positive zero or positive so positive numbers if i start distributing this 2 square root x times square root of x is just 2x that makes it look like this part of your function's domain problem is gone now you all real numbers that cannot happen and so from that idea from the beginning say this is not a polynomial it already has domain issues and we know polynomial polynomials have no domain issues you can plug in anything to a polynomial because they don't have rational exponents this is x to the one-half power that's already a rational exponent you can't have that for polynomials so right there you'd say yeah that's not polynomial that that's a radical expression actually and our domain for polynomials has to be all real numbers all the time however what i just said was sometimes you can get a better look if you if you distribute and you can sort of treat it like a polynomial sometimes so it is worthwhile to understand that this is not a polynomial we distributed from the beginning we knew our domain wasn't all real numbers we know our domain had some radicals in it we knew our domain had fractional exponents they're not integers integers are whole pi basically whole numbers here non-negative integers are positive whole numbers in zero um even if we distribute it though we still have that square root of x so we're kind of done smoking on that one now the last example i want to talk to you about i am going to teach you right here it's the probably the most important one for you to pay attention to because this is going to really save you a lot of time later often times we get polynomials that are factored or you create a factored type of polynomial but you still need to figure out the end behavior why well you don't want to know what this this polynomial looks like whether it's going like this or like this like this my favorite dance moves what um so you're going to want that's really dorky i'm sorry you're going to want to know what the leading term is the leading term gives you the degree it will give you end behavior it'll give you the maximum number of turning points that you have but it is a pain to have to distribute this let me pause right here for a second sometimes you're going to have to distribute this if you are going to start on the right hand side and work your way left so distribute your expo well distribute this because it has an exponent x minus 1 times x minus 1 then you distribute this through your product then you distribute this term through the rest of them or this factor through the rest of them don't start this way it's very confusing that's just my opinion now can we find the leading term without distribution yes i call it fake distribution i don't know what if there's if there is a real i've never seen anybody else do this but here's the way that you would do it show where your products are so for instance you have a product here here here take the largest power of your variable that you would get if you were to distribute every factor i'm going to say that again look at all of your factors there's one two three and four take the largest power that you would get if you were to distribute it honestly all you got to do because distribution would take your this term times another term twice take your exponent multiply it by your largest term it should be in order right because these are polynomials take it and distribute that so take it this is 1 and distribute that so take for every factor the largest power that you would get here this is just two here this is x cubed for this factor you get let's see x squared two times one is two that's x squared here's x to the first one times two is two that's another x squared can you see it if you were to factor or if you were to distribute this you have x minus 1 times x minus 1 the largest power you get is x squared here you have x squared oh there's there's only one of those you'd have x squared that's your largest power here x cubed there's nothing to multiply that by as far as changing the exponent if you take every factor and do what i've done take the largest power you would get by distribution and multiply it this is going to give you your leading term just remember when you're multiplying these these variables that have exponents you add your exponents so we have two we'd have let's see three four five six seven two x to the seventh is your leading term your degree is seven your leading coefficient is two your end behavior is a positive because hey that's a positive number odd we haven't got to end behavior i know this but i'm prefacing where we're going so you it makes sense when we get there you're positive and odd it's going to look like this your function is going to look like this it's going to go from negative infinity to positive infinity it's not going to be like this that would be a positive even this would be a negative odd negative leading term an odd degree and this would be a negative even negatively term and then an even degree so this is a positive odd we know for sure that this polynomial if you were to distribute it and you were to graph it it's going to have an end behavior looks like this start down there go to there that's pretty neat so that's the way that this fake distribution sort of works um if this had been let's change it one time if this had been like a power three this would be a six you'd multiply two times three that would give you six and you would add them up so you'd get three nine ten eleven that would be to the 11th power so anyhow that's going to come in really handy i'm going to refresh your memory when we get more into like multiplicity and finding out sketching of these polynomials but that that's practically what you need to know right now polynomials are these many terms added and subtracted you want them in order you want to be able to find your leading term it's super important your degree and your constant the only thing we really have to focus on is that all of your exponents or polynomials have to be non-negative integers so that's zero and positive numbers and whole numbers if not you don't have a polynomial polynomial's domain is all real numbers means you have zero issues because there's nothing to create issues in a polynomial that also means that it's going to be the smooth continuous curve with no cusps those are sharp points no gaps no holes and no asymptotes that's super convenient and lastly you want these things in order all the time hope that makes sense that's just a little refresher kind of a bigger refresher than i thought and we'll get on into power functions next time you
