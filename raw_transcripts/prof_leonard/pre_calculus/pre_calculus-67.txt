Transcript for: Introduction to Sequences (Precalculus - College Algebra 67)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we are going to start something new we're going to start talking about sequences and series sequences in this video series in the next video and then we'll talk about some some specific types of sequences and series like the arithmetic and the geometric sequences and series discover what they're all about and then have a math mathematical proof by induction and that's uh that's the next several videos so kind of a different unit for us before we move on to anything else so when we start talking about sequences and series I need you to understand what they are how they're created and what we can do with them so when we talk about sequence and series there's a difference between them sometimes students get confused a sequence is simply a list of numbers they're not added they're not multiplied they're just listed with commas between them and they're from some sort of a formula some sort of a sequence expression that's based on the index of your your term and we'll talk about that as you go what a series does a series takes that sequence and adds it up that's the difference between a sequence and a series so a Series has a lot more math involved in it uh there's a lot of formulas that we can do to add up series but sequences we don't have that because you're not adding them you're just listing it out so a sequence is simply a list of numbers that's given by some sort of a a formula really um so that's what this really says a sequence of a list of numbers given by a formula detered by the index of a term what in the world does that mean well an index is the number of the term that you have in your your sequence quence so we should be able to say oh can we find the second term the first term the fifth term the H 100th term given by whatever our formula is for that particular sequence the answer is yeah we should be able to do that um so when we start talking about sequences in the formula you're going to notice that you have this little subscript we call that an index and given an index you should be able to plug that in look how it's related there's an A subn and then inside of your formula you have another n this says to find a term of your sequence you're just plugging in whatever term you want to find so do we want to find the first term plug in one oh that would be a sub one that would be the first term plug in one it would tell you what term what the value of that term is and we can find as many terms as we want to we can find whatever term we want to Simply by plugging in the index of whatever term we need to find um this is the standard way that you see sequences sometimes you'll see them in Brackets it's also very very common generally we we write our our sequence in Brackets like that so let's go ahead and jump right into it a sequence is a list of numbers given by a formula and if you want to find any term you just plug in the subscript or the index of whatever term you want to find so we're going to find the first five terms we'll talk about a little bit more after that uh but we're going to go ahead and practice right now so let's let's say we wanted to find first term a sub one couple questions you might have is well what can n be can n be decimals can n be zero can n be negative well n can be neg be zero like the zeroth term again awkward to say that but you can have that n cannot be fractions can't be decimals can't be negative we call them natural numbers so a sub a natural number the index is always a natural number one two 3 these counting numbers that we have so you're not going to be plugging in like 34 thank goodness right we're just plugging in whole positive natural numbers to get these terms so if we want to find the first term we're going to take one our index we're going to plug it in so a sub one notice how the one replaces the N here and must replace the N here just like a normal function would so we plug in one so a sub 1 would be 1^ 2ar + 1 that would give you two all first term in our sequence is two how about a sub 2 well if you want to find the second term all of these terms are based on their index and then the the formula that we're using is basing whatever value we're getting out for that term on the index as well so a sub 2 says replace your n with two replace your M with 2 that would be 2^2 + 1 that would give us five well how about three three would be our our third term let's replace that with three for the fourth term and fifth term we're doing exactly the same thing so a sub4 says take your index replace it with four replace your n with four they'll give you the fourth term in your sequence 17 and you might start to develop some patterns here you see a sequence should be really a patterned list of numbers it should have a pattern to it so if you look at this we start with two sure um if we had started with Zer a sub Z we would have got one notice that you plug in zero you get one so let's take a look at what's really happening to get from here to here to here to here can you see what's happening can you see that from two to five we're adding three from 5 to 10 we're adding five from 10 to 17 we're adding seven we added 3 5 7 the next term that we get should be added nine it's going to create something with a pattern now it's not that easy to go from a pattern and get this but I'm going to show you in the latter part of this video how to do that um a way to structure your thinking on on how to get back to a a formula from some sort of a list of numbers but in general it could should create some sort of a patterned list for you let's check it this should be let's see um 17 + 9 it should be 26 but let's go ahead and find out so plug it in five would give us 5^ 2 + 1 that's 26 and sure enough this would be add 3 at five at seven at nine the next would be add 11 it's creating a list of number fors that's definitely pattern but we always have a formula to fall back on to see where we can plug your index and get the appropriate term could you plug in zero if you wanted to a sub Z you can do that you can't plug in negatives can't plug in fractions or decimals but if you did we would get one and notice from 1 to two you would add one then add three then add five 7 9 the next should be 11 13 15 we're adding odd numbers to get these it's based on this that's kind of interesting that adding odd numbers up starting with one is you can find any term by that formula so what if you wanted to find out the 100th term would you really want to add up these odd numbers until you get to a sub 100 well probably not you'd have to do a whole long list could you find the 100th term simply by plugging in 100 yes that's why we have a formula so you do 100 SAR + 1 it would give you whatever term you are looking for so we found the first five terms our list of numbers our sequence it has a pattern to it is going to be I'm going to remove the ace Sub Zero 2 5 10 17 26 and then it doesn't end so the way we show it doesn't end is we put a few dots and then we close that Curly bracket so this is the first five terms starting with nals 1 and you should be told that like where do you start Nal 1 n equals 0 I told you n equal 1 so we started there um you you have to be told where to start you don't have to start at Nal 1 do you you could start at Nal 20 if you really wanted to but you're going to be asked find the first five terms of something that implies start with one um so if they tell you zero great but in general you just start with one less otherwise specified and you'll list out the first five terms in that sequence it doesn't end and you can find any term just by plugging in whatever that index is hope that makes sense you hope you're seeing what a sequence is very simple thing uh sometimes we over complicate it it's very simple thing say plug in a number you're going to get that particular term let's let's move on to the next one so b subn = n / 3n so it says to find the nth term you're going to take whatever that value of n is plug it into your formula and get a value out of your term the nth term uh if we leave it in terms of n is sometimes called the general term so we can do things like this would go until you hit your general term whatever your n stops at since our general term is given by n n^2 + 1 we can do it looks a little funny it might look a little funny to you 1 2 3 4 that would be listing five terms in general uh 2 5 10 17 26 the first five terms and you would keep doing that forever following that pattern is what that says to you so let's find the first five terms of B subn let's put them in a list here it's it's not really hard to do you're going to see the pattern as we go so b subn = n 3 to then says I want to find the first term let's plug in zero that would be one oh sorry I I miss I misspoke that would be pluging in one for the first term so 1 over 3 the 1st if I want to find the second term I plug in two that would be 2 over 3 2 and we can simplify as we go but I do want you to notice that it's really important to be able to go backwards and this sort of a pattern to it what's really happening to our numerator what's really happening to our denominator our numerator is getting exactly what this index is three our denominator is getting three to whatever power our index is I'm prefacing something we're going to do in just a little bit what we're going to do in just a little bit is go backwards I'm going to give you a list of numbers I'm going to ask you to come up with that formula for the sequence and it's really important to be able to base whatever numbers you have on whatever index you have for your terms that's incredibly valuable because then you can make the jump to the general term the term based on N that that would be like the general term the term based on N how about the fourth so the fourth term so B sub4 is how we say that that would be four over 3 4th and you can see the pattern the next term is going to be 5 over 3 5th the one after that would be 6 over 3 6 7 over 3 7th n over 3 to n that's exactly what that says to us now we're going to simplify these you get 1/3 2 9th 3 27 4 over 81 and 5 over 243 but when we go and simplify the fraction a bit more especially that guy right there we're going to start losing the pattern it's not going to be as easy to see if you're asked for the first five terms these are it if you're asked for the general sequences listen out this is it you so it goes Forever Until you want to stop it whatever nend you're asked for here we were asked to stop at the fifth term so you'd have 1/3 then 2 9ths then 1 nth um notice how this is getting smaller this might look really funny to you you go what is happening with that uh well this is 3 9ths 1/3 is 3 9ths 2 9ths 1 nth 4 81 5 over 247 these fractions are getting smaller and smaller and smaller it would look like a decreasing function almost like an exponential wait a wait a minute that is an exponential hopefully you find that very interesting that that is based on some sort of an exponential with a a a term or a base of 1/3 something over three so anyhow our sequences are based on our index we plug it in could you plug in zero here well sure you would get 0 over one that would be zero so you'd start with 0 1/3 2 9 if you were asked to start with the zeroth term by plugging in zero and finding b sub Z we list out whatever number of terms were asked to and that's pretty much how we deal with these sequences U we can simplify our fractions of course this would be kind of nice cuz you can see the pattern can't you 3 9 27 81 243 those are powers of three 1 2 3 four five that's our index itself when we start simplifying them of course we start losing that so now now listen please listen to this when we get to the next part of it and we're going backwards we're going to want to make all of these terms we given the same type of form so we're going to say wait a minute that's 3981 not sorry 3 9981 247 we need to make those those look similar to be able to find a pattern to it and so we'll we'll start thinking that way all right let's move on to the next example again find the first five terms we're going to see what this part does what that part of a sequence that negative -1 to an exponent we're going to see that that all that does is alternate signs it's going to make positive negative positive negative positive negative that's important for us to realize as we go back at some of these patterns um that that causes us to have alternating signs so if we see alternating signs we're going to have netive 1 to some exponent the other thing I want you to notice is that even though I've only found the first five terms here and then the general statement you can find any term you want if you wanted to find the the 50th term you'd plug in 50 over 3 to the 50th now think about that 50 over 3 to the 50th 3 to the 50th is enormous 50 over that is going to be very close to zero almost like this horizontal ASM toote like all exponential that have exponential decay or decreasing exponentials get to so this would have a horizont ASM toote somewhere we're going to say the same thing would happen here if I just needed to Simply find uh a sub 10 the 10th term in our sequence I can plug in 10 it'd be very easy to do we're just practicing finding out what our sequence is by plugging in the first five terms so let's start with a sub one so a sub1 says if I want to find the first term I'm going to let my index get evaluated here and on that side as well so a sub1 would equal whatever I get when I plug in 1 to n so even though there can be a bit more work here we're still doing the same thing so we're taking one and evaluating -1 to the 1 - 1 so n is replaced by one everywhere 1 - 1 is z negative 1 to the zero power is one and that fraction that we get is 1 over 1 so 2us 2 * 1 is 2 - 1 is 1 1 / 1 is 1 so our first term a sub 1 is 1 let's do a sub 2 a sub 2 says that if you want to find second term let N be evaluated for two now I really need you to focus on what happens with this piece as we're working down as we do this think about what's going to happen here this was this was a zero power think of it like even even though zero is not really even here but think of it like even and so anything zero power would give you a one this is going to be an odd exponent anything to a negative to an odd exponent is going to give you a negative one the next one will be even it'll give you positive one it's going to alternate all that negative one is doing is giving us positives for even exponents and odds sorry negative for odd exponents it's all that's happening it's alternating our signs for us so -1 to the 2 - 1 is 1 that would be 1 the fraction is 2 over let's see 4 - 1 is 3 2/3 giving us -23 a sub3 going be similar but we should expect that this is going to be 1 raised to an even power giving us positive1 let's see the third term take your three plug it in so we would have -1 to the 3 -1 power well 3 - 1 is 2 and so if we have1 to the second power -1 to the second power is in parentheses that would be POS 1 our fraction is 3 over let's see 2 * 3 that's that's 6 - 1 is 5 that's 3 fths since we got a positive 1 1 * 35ths is 35ths can you see the pattern can you maybe you can see it now you'll definitely see on the next next one we started with 1 over 1 then we got 2 over 3 but it's negative then we got 3 over 5 but it's positive so there's a few things happening here we're going to really see the pattern on the next one if you don't see it yet so a sub4 a sub four says if you want to find the fourth term take the index of four plug it into your n that would be your uh the the subscript of whatever term you want to find it's going to find that particular term for you so take the four and plug it into your formula there for your sequence that would be -1 to 4 -1 4 over 2 * 4 -1 well what's going to happen then this exponent is now odd notice how it's acting like even then odd then even then odd then even then odd then even then odd that's what you get with n minus one you're going to get U an even or odd number it's just going to be off from whatever index you're putting in so if you're plugging in an even it'll give you an odd plug in an odd it'll give you an even how could I make it match up so if I plug it in even it gives me even plug it in odd it gives me an odd I just wouldn't have the minus one so whenever you see -1 to the N or1 to the N minus one it's going to give you a sign alternation for every term every time in this case we have an even number even number of minus one is all OD -1 to the 3 power or an odd in general is going to give US1 our fraction is numerator is four denominator is let's see 8 - 1 is 7 I really want you to think about the pattern right now we started with positive one over one then we got NE 2/3 POS 35ths 47 think about what's happening what's the next one going to be think about the patterns very important for people to find the patterns the next one should be should be positive or negative should be positive the next numerator should be let's see 1 2 3 4 the next numerator should be five the next denominator should be 1 3 5 7 the next denominator should be nine you can do that with the patterns you can find out each little piece am I dealing with a positive or negative in this case I should be alternating signs get positive what's my numerator doing 1 2 3 4 should be five what's my denominator doing in general 2 nus one will always give you odd numbers it's listing at the odd numbers 1 3 5 7 and N because the denominator here would be one remember that denominator was one the numerator is just listen out oh wait a minute if that's based on n and n is always just the natural numbers it's giving my counting numbers for every term it should give me that fifth term and if we look at it this is 5 - 1 that's 4 1 4th power is POS 1 your fraction is 5 over 9 and that's what we expected to happen so if we want to list out our first five terms for our sequence the first five terms are really positive one over one but we've simplified that haven't we we've got one then -2/3 POS 35s -47 and POS 5 9 so if we're asked to just find the first five terms we've done it hopefully you've noticed what's going on here the alternation of signs the numerator matching up with whatever your index is 1 2 3 four five denominator matching up with the odd every o odd number so we're we're basically skipping evens that's what 2 nus one does so we're having 1 3 5 7 9 the sequential odd numbers here if you want to show the sequence in general just to show the pattern you'd have this you just put a dot dot dot and then do that1 n to the nus one n over 2 nus one typically though we just asked to find a certain number of terms um if you want to show that that's that's okay what if you had to find the 10th term well then we plug in 10 and we do whatever the math says in our case we have 10 - 1 is 9 -1 to the 9th is1 then you'd have 10 over 19 so that would be 10/ 2 * 10 -1 and you get whatever term you actually need to find I hope this makes sense I hope you're seeing what a sequence is it's not super complicated but it is important very important for a lot of math that we do especially later on when you get to like calculus 2ish so it's just this list of numbers it's based on whatever your index is and it needs to give you a formula for that right now what we're going to do is we're going to go backwards I'm going to give you the list of numbers I'm going to show you a couple techniques on how to go backwards and find your sequence from it um I'm not going to give you incredibly hard examples to do I'll make them understand to you so you have a process for doing it I'll see a little bit now that you understand what a sequence is really about let's try to go ahead and create our own formulas from some sequences given very important piece of of understanding is how to find a pattern and represent it so that you don't have so that you don't have to list out the sequence to find like the H hundredth term you probably don't want to do that here so if that's your first term and I said find the hund one two three here's the fourth and you go I don't want to find like 96 more terms to just find the 100th term that's crazy I don't want to do that I want to spend the time to find the pattern relate the pattern to the index and in doing so you find the general term if I can find the general term I can plug in any number and then find the 100 term very very easily that's the idea so I'm going to give you a way to do it I'm not saying that with these easy examples is exactly how everything is going to work what I'm saying is this idea will yield for you this this formula for your sequence uh it's the best way I found out how to do it um so some of these can be quite tricky but in general here's the idea on going through and taking a pattern this list of numbers and figuring out your general term from it so number one thing we want to do take your terms and write them down so if I give you four terms write down a sub one is is this term your first term and second term third term fourth term however many you have then make them all look the same so the same form if if most of them are fractions make them all fractions if we have um a sign show that as ne1 out front or one out front if we have powers relate them all to the same type of base if you can so somehow find out a form that all of these take after that make the jump to n we're about to do that right now so number one the first thing I'm doing I'm not really overthinking it I'm just going to write down all four terms next I'm going to do I'm going to make them all appear the same form if I can so for instance I've noticed that these are fractions and that isn't I'm going to write that as a fraction take the one that's off and write it as whatever the rest of them are after that what we're going to do is we're going to try to write them as as something that can be represented the same in all of them are we doing odd numbers uh is there something like we have a power of something so I'm looking at my numerator I'm saying well my numerator is one in every case that that's really good so I'm fairly confident that every single term is going to have a one on the numerator and now I'm going to look at my denominator and think what relates 2 and four now the one's throwing me off so I'm going to leave that for a second what relates 2 and 4 and 8 could you think about the next term 2 4 8 what are you doing uh well it appears that I multiplying by two so 1 * 2 is 2 2 * 2 is 4 4 * 2 is 8 8 * 2 is it's probably 16 now that's that's great I could say I'm multiplying by two but maybe I could also think about about this is powers of two so the reason why is because that doesn't have a two in it so I'm I'm really it's really hard to multiply something by two and get one I don't want to start doal with fractions like that so maybe I think of powers of two like this is two to the first oh two to the 1 two to the second 2 to the 3r next would be 2 to the 4th now unfortunately though you have to have everything related the same so if this is 2 the 3r 2 the 2 2 to the F first what would one be we know about that we know that if I oh wait how about 2 to the 0 2 to the 0o would give me one so I've listed out my terms doing nothing I've made them all the same form they look like fractions um I've tried to relate them somehow to the same something whatever you multiplying by or a common base I found a common base 2 the 3r 2 the 2 2 the 1 2 to the zero and let's double check does this still give me 1 12 1/4 and 1/8 yes they're all the same and now finally once I have them all the same form I somehow relate whatever is changing to whatever my index is whatever is changing to whatever my index is so the one is not changing you know what that means that means that this is going to show up in our final formula as one the one doesn't change one one one one this is going to have a one the two does not change 2 2 2 two this is going to have a two the exponent of the denominator is changing 0 1 2 and 3 I need to relate that to my index so I'm going to try to come up with some sort of an expression based on N based on my index that represents this so how can I do that well let's think about it how is three related to four and two related to three and one related to two and zero related to one it appears that what I'm doing is I'm taking my index and I'm subtracting one from it it looks like this is taking 4 - 1 giv me 3 3 - 1 giv me 2 2 - 1 give me 1 1 - 1 giv me zero so I'm relating this to whatever my index is and now we're ready to make the jump as soon as you have the index listed somewhere in your term that should be the only thing changing is the index should be changing so list those things out whatever is changing 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 call that n so I know that I have one that's not changing here's a one two that's not changing here's a two minus one that's not even changing I'm going to have a minus one the one matches my one my two matches my two my this exponent that part of the exponent is matching my index called that n and this represents the sequence that we have so if I wanted to find check it check it if you want to um if I want to see term number one I should be plugging in one and getting out one so if I plug in one 1 - 1 is0 two the 0 1 1 over 1 is 1 let's check term four plug in four 4 - 1 is 3 2 3r is 8 1 over 8 is 1 18 so it does work and I hope that that that that sequence of steps makes sense to you write out your terms don't change them make them the same form you should be able to find out some relationship amongst the terms is it are you multiply are you adding are you are you adding the same number are you taking a power like we are here and then try to relate it to your n do you necessarily have to show this step no not really um you could probably get there from here and go hey you know what that's that's one - one that's 2 - one that's 3 - one that's four - one that's n minus one you can totally do that I'm giving you as as clear as I can make it my thought process going through this now could you find the 50th term the 12th term the 100th term that whatever you want yeah you could if you wanted to find the 10th term let's say cuz I really don't want to plug in a big number a sub 10 you would just plug in 10 that would be 2 1/ 2 to the 9th because 10 - 1 is 9 that's a whole lot better than writing out all these terms until you get there and you could evaluate that 1 over 2 the 9th figure out what 2 the 9th is and then you'd have a nice fraction so I hope that makes sense I hope you're a lot of times students really struggle with this in calculus 2 teach this in calculus 2 and sometimes student go I don't know what that means um I'm trying to develop for you a thought process for how to take a sequence which is a pattern and write it as something meaningful that you can find other terms with without having to complete the entire sequence it's a very valuable thing to be able to do all right let's move on to the last one we're going to do the same thing uh we're going to talk about this we're going to see what the patterns are we're going to relate it to our index and then we'll have a general term so B subn is 2 then4 then 6 then 8 then 10 then what would the next term be what would the one after that be can you see that the next term should be we'll think about it should be positive or negative start evaluating this sequence I see um positive negative positive negative positive next one should be negative I see 2 4 6 8 10 the next one should be 12 these are alternating even numbers what we're going to do is we're going to try to create a a sequence for that a general term for our sequence but it starts with listing these out so take them and write them down for every term I've given you five terms just write down five terms now let's all make them look the same so what do you mean look the same well let's start by saying these are all even numbers but I'm seeing that they have a negative in front when you see that try to do this try to make it so that you can relate it to one where you either are multiplying by one or negative 1 one or negative 1 one or negative 1 so every negative number can be represented as negative 1 times that value now that would look that looks really funny but that would look funny if we were just saying oh well certain numbers I want are multiplied by ne1 because I feel like it so with the and the 10 and the two consider that it's still being multiplied by one but somehow not giving you a negative that starts to look the same are you seeing what we're trying to do we're trying to get every term to look the same form so here I've said 24 well I really want them to have some feature that's the same this is negative 1 this is positive one this is positive 1 negative 1 positive 1 next one be negative 1 then positive one then negative one then positive one it's giving us an alternation now let's try to to find what that 2 4 6 8 and 10 is and then we'll finalize what's happening with the 1 and netive 1 now we have I have preface this I've shown you an alternating sequence where you're probably going to have netive one to some power that's exactly what we're going to have we just need to tie it into the N somehow so let's take a look at our 2 4 6 8 and 10 um well they're all even which means I can relate this as two times something in other words 2 4 6 8 and 10 are all something multiplied by two so it's write that at this point when I took this class or something similar to it or studied this for the first time I thought how in the world this how in the world is this person figuring this out I'll never figure that out um it it does come with practice I will tell you that but it's also this thought process of getting them to look all the same will really guide your thoughts like how can you make these all look the same I know 2 4 6 8 and 10 well it looks like they're all something multiplied by two I just write the two this would be two * 1 2 3 4 5 that would give us that would give us 10 that would give us8 64 and 2 it's the same sequence but now I have it written differently so I can evaluate how it's related to my index now we start looking at for the pieces that are changing and the pieces that aren't changing so what's not changing here what's not changing is going to show up as a constant in your formula what's not changing is 2 two two two and two that's not changing another thing that's sort of changing but not really is you are going to have a negative one here a negative one not all these have negative 1es that's true that's because that will be raised to an exponent that is changing whenever you see this positive negative positive negative or negative positive negative positive or 1ga 1 1ga 1 or negative 1 one you're going to have a negative one in there raised to some exponent that's what alternation does now it is up to us to figure out what that exponent is we're going to do that in a minute but these are two things that aren't changing the two and there will be a negative one on every one of those terms what is changing needs to get related to the N the index so we start doing that uh one two whoa that's cool one matches with one two matches with two three matches with three four and five and N notice how that is exactly what we're doing here this is five matches with five so n matches with n that's what we're doing we're relating the things that are changing to the ends that are changing our index and in this case it's just whatever end shows up so one should have a one here and two should have a two here and three should have a three here and five should have a five here and 10 should have a 10 there and that's exactly what is happening now we got to do our sign so the way to to deal with this is to either take this to the N or the N minus one power depending on whether the first term is positive or negative so if your first term is positive you need a zero to get that if your first term is negative you need a one to get that since we start with our first term and we have a positive you're going to have to take that one and subtract one from it and you know what right now probably the best way to deal with this just trial and error until you really understand what's going on try to plug in one and see if it gives you gives you a positive one if it doesn't then uh then change this and just make it an N so let me show you let's pretend I did that if I tried to plug in one for my first term I would get1 to the first it would give me 1 i' go oops that's not right so what would I do with that subtract one and it'll work now I'll plug in one 1 - 1 is 0 1 the 0 power is 1 1 * 2 that's 2 * 1 would give us two oh that works try the rest of them let's plug in two uh 2 - 1 is 1-1 to the first is -1 got it and then remember we're plugging in two here 2 * 2 is four try the third term plug in three so if I plug in three 3 - 1 is 2 1 to the second power is positive great and then 2 * 3 is 6 it works it's going to work for all of them this is much nicer than writing out the first 50 terms if you need to find B sub 50 or the 50th term for the 50th term would actually be that bad for the 50th term we'd have negative 1 still that doesn't change only the ends change that's why we write this in the identify the only things that are changing because if only the NS change you just need to see the things that are changing and call them NS somehow that's all we're doing just takes a lot of thought to do it so negative 1 doesn't change 50 minus one while that seems like a large number it's really just about being even or odd so 50 - 1's 491 to the 49th power 1 to an odd power is negative two doesn't change two is where we're getting the evenness from this is how you represent even numbers is 2N for whatever N is a positive whole number so 2N would give you all even numbers the first whatever even numbers you want 2 4 6 8 10 are the first five even numbers and then 2 * 50 would give you 100 it should make sense to you that the 50th even number is is 100 there's 100 digits in a row right if you count them the first 50 odd numbers are 1 through 90 uh 1 through 99 yeah you don't count that zero and the first 50 even numbers end with 100 so hopefully that makes sense to you we just have negative 100 because we have that alternation this is how and this looks a little awkward I really should have a little more space the exponent you know that's just on the negative one typically your alternation is written first though so that you can immediately identify and go oh yeah that's alternating signs it's going to start with a positive then the next would be a negative positive negative positive negative if we start with nals 1 okay this is a really common example to get on like a test or something like that uh so just check out how it really works um make sure that when you're trying to go and find a sequence from a list of numbers that you write them all out you try to make them the same form I'm just going to give you this extra one because I think you should try it on your own I really do um try to follow that try to try to write them all out all four of these terms try to make them the same form identify what that negative positive negative positive negative positive negative positive doing the next term should be negative it's alternating try to identify that they're all fractions write them in the same type of a fraction you know what do youan the same same type of fraction see if there's a root fraction here that's repeating itself Maybe by a power sometimes you can multiply the say number sometimes you have to find a power um so for here we're going to take and say this is -1 * 23 this is postive 1 * 2/3 and - 1 sorry 49s doing the math in my head again 4 9ths and -1 * 827 and positive 1 * 16 81 now these fractions don't look the same but see if you can make them the same think about 2/3 can you relate 4 9 to 2/3 8 27 to 2/3 1681 to 2/3 or all of them to some other fraction like we did here can we relate all these to two times some number so for us keep your netive 1 keep your 2/3 keep your one but let's think about four nights can you write four kns as sub root fraction well this would be 2/3 to the 2 power 2 2 over 3 now you could write it that way too 2 2 over 3 2 this is 2 1st over 3 1st and 2 3r over 3 3r and 2 4th over 3 4th can you make it even simpler can you say well wait a minute because the the numerator denominator both raised at the same same power can we really factor that power out over Division and have 2/3 to the 1 2/3 to the 2 2/3 to the 3 2/3 to 4th now we're about ready to start writing down our general term or the formula for our sequence identify the things that are not changing the things that aren't changing are you will have a 2/3 you will have A1 and you will have some exponents nicely our exponent 1 2 3 and four matches our index so if that matches our index our index here will represent that exponent so 4 4nn just like every other index matched its power as far as our negative 1 goes we need to we need to get that alternation correct so we start with a negative number so try something try n is -1 to the first power going to give us the negative that we want yes this matches I think guessing and check until you understand guessing checking is pretty pretty okay to use for your um your alternation so because we start with a negative we need to start with an odd power our first term is odd so let's start with the first power or the second power for second term third power for third term fourth power fourth term nth power for the nth term is how we really determine that this is the general term for whatever that sequence represents one other thing um keep in mind that for for odds it would look up very similar to that but you'd have to start subtracting one maybe I'll go ahead and do that one too okay my personal opinion is that the odds can be quite difficult U because while they're easy to define recursively you understand what's going on as you look at your pattern and you can base it on your previous term that's what recursive means for instance I can look this and go 1 3 5 7 9 the next one would be 11 13 15 they're odd numbers I can see that I can see how to find it I can see that I'm taking the previous number adding two previous number adding two previous number adding two previous term adding two that's a recursive formula and it'd be pretty easy to find you can say that a of n would be the previous term + two that would actually do it if I want to find the fifth term oh man this this pretty Advanced actually for recursive formulas if I want to find the fifth term I'd look at the fourth term and add two if I want to find the fourth term I'd look at the third term and add two so if I wanted to find a sub4 I'd look at 4 - 1 is 3 and I would add two so if I want to find the fourth term I'd look at the third term and add two and now ignore the A's versus B's I'm just give an example here but this would be look at your previous term and add two sixth term would be look at the fifth term and add two You' get 11 do you see how recur Works do you see how it's looking at your previous term and doing something to it to find your next term it's almost like induction when we get there but it's saying you need to know your previous term in order to find it sometimes you need to know your previous finite number of terms to find it so if I wanted to find the H 100th term this would not do it because i' need to know the 99th if I want to find the 99th term I need to know the 98 so while we can Define things by the pattern and say yes there is a pattern the pattern is look at your previous term ter and add two to it look at your previous term and add two look at your previous term and add two look at your previous term and add two that's exactly what it says it's not beneficial to find the nth term or general term this is not it so it's quite difficult really because when we take a look at this and go ah man I don't know I can't how am I supposed to relate all these to the same thing it's you have to think outside the box here um we try to relate to n 1 equals n oh okay but this doesn't equal to n 3 doesn't equal 2 and 5 doesn't equal 3 and S is equal four it looks like it's uh one more then two more then three more then it's predictable but it it's not really matching up perfectly to the thing that's changing so instead let's try to relate him something else let's try to relate him something that's not changing for instance I noticed that uh while this is 1 and 3 and 5 and seven and 9 I can think of it as this is 1 less than two 2 1 less than 4 1 less than 6 1 less than 8 well and in doing so I have something that's not changing I have this minus one I have a minus1 that's not changing okay now that that took some thinking outside the box though didn't it because it's it's really hard to relate that if you're not used to it but now you've seen it doesn't mean you're going to be perfect at it right now but at least you're you're kind of exploring that thought now how about 2 4 6 8 and 10 can I relate those little pieces to something that's not changing well it appears that 2 4 6 8 and 10 are all multiples of two again that's 2 * 1 - 1 and 2 * 2 - 1 and 2 * 3 - 1 and 2 * 4 1 and 2 * 5 - 1 we have another thing that's not changing we have a two every one of those is true it's going to give you nine and seven and five and three and one and we've identified the pieces that aren't changing do you see the point the point is you need to identify the pieces of your sequence that are not changing and write them down then relate the thing that is changing and it has to relate the same way in every term to your nend that's why this screws us up so much it's not related the same way to our n every time we can't just go oh this related to n is equal but this one is you add one and this one is you add two that doesn't work that doesn't work at all for sequences it must whatever you have done here the changing piece must relate to your n the same way for all of them which is why this takes so much work you know well I don't know let's this doesn't look like it relates really really well it's relate to something else this is 2 - 1 4 - 1 6 - 1 8 - 1 10 - 1 oh I'm subtracting one every time great I have a minus one let's look at our 2 4 6 8 10 do those relate to something well I I have two times some number for every one of those so I've related that that's why we got a two now it's pretty nice because we have 1 2 3 4 and 5 for n = 1 2 3 4 and 5 it appears that our index is here two and two three and three four and four five and five the piece that is changing is just our index it's n 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 n n to relate the part that's changing to your index and we've done that it's just our n whatever our index is appearing this is actually the sequence this is the the general term and that is how odd numbers are defined in like number Theory and things like that even is 2N odd is 2 N and you just subtract one so you'd get 2 4 6 8 10 and subtract one from it you get 1 3 5 79 it's actually much more difficult to Define right because you have to base them on even numbers and say oh I'm subtracting one from it which is where this this comes from here's all your even numbers and to get the odds you subtract one that's why I wanted to show that one to you I hope it's made sense you can do this recursively like I said you can say my next term will be based on my previous one my next term my sixth term would be based on my fifth term plus two and you can do it that way this is a recursive type of formula it says based on previous terms this is not this is a straight up formula for the sequence this one will allow you to find the H 100th term if you want to uh the 100th term be 2 * 100 that would be 200 - 1 is 199 199 is the 100th odd number this will not let you do that you'd have to know the 99th term to be able to figure out that 100th term and it does work though so like if I just told you B sub 100 is 199 the term right before that would be 197 so the odd numbers would be 197 and 199 the 99th term would have to be 197 and then we get 189 those are sequential odd numbers so check it out if I wanted to find the the 100 term this 100th term this way I would have B sub 100 should equal B sub 99 the previous term notice how 100 - 1 is 99 100 - 1 is 99 plus two well do you know the 99th term yeah because I gave it to you the 99th term is 197 plus two so recursive formulas have to look at the previous term or terms and do something to get your your current term so B sub 100 says look at your previous term and add two look at your previous term 187 and add two oh I should get 199 that is my H 100th term but it requires a lot more information uh to do that requires previous terms information all right I've I've really gone way further than I intended to on this video I just got kind of excited about the sequences so hopefully you understand a lot about sequences now you understand that they're list of numbers they're not added they're just a list of numbers you typically find the first five or so by a formula the hard part is going backwards getting a list and then creating a formula for it I have given you some very good ideas on how to do that how to relate it in the same form how to relate it to something that's not changing how to write those not changing pieces as part of your general term and then relate the piece that is changing somehow and it does not have to be easy to your index and that will be your n in your general term so I hope I I made that make sense to you where the stuff comes from it takes a lot of practice uh but in the next video we're going to talk about series taking your sequences and adding them up so I'll see you for that e
