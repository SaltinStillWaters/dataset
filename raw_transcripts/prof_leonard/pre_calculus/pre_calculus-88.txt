Transcript for: How to Graph Cosecant and Secant (Precalculus - Trigonometry 15)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about the graphs of secant and cosecant and it's going to be pretty fast because we're going to relate them back to sine and cosine so that they're just reciprocals we're going to use the fact that they're reciprocals and the graphs are based on sine and cosine for cosecant and secant respectively so we're going to take a look at that and it should be pretty straightforward so let's take a look first at cosecant if cosecant is the reciprocal of sine so cosecant x is the reciprocal of sine of x we can base the graph of cosecant on the graph of sine in fact there's a lot of very interesting things that happen and when we start graphing with transformations what i typically do is i'll graph the sine version of that function and then just draw cosecant right on top of it or for secant i'll graph cosine and then i'll graph secant right on top of that so because they're so strongly related because they're reciprocal functions we can use sine and cosine as very nice tools to graph cosecant and secant so let's take a look at sine if sine of x is this nice curve that repeats every two pi so we have two periods of sine right here shown in a dotted line so we don't get confused what we're actually doing here's what's going to happen with cosecant because cosecant is the reciprocal let's take a look at some of the reciprocals of the values that are on the sine of x function firstly let's look at all the local maxima and minimum well what we remember is that sine has peaks at positive one and sort of valleys at negative one well if we take a look at the point pi over two comma one which is on the graph of sine well the reciprocal of 1 is still 1. because cosecant is the reciprocal of sine since sine of pi over 2 is 1 cosecant of pi over 2 is also 1. and so we have a point there the same thing is going to happen at negative 3 pi over 2 so sine of negative 3 pi over 2 that's positive 1. so cosecant of negative 3 pi over 2 is also positive 1 the the reciprocal of positive 1 is positive 1. the reciprocal of negative 1 is also negative 1. and so we're going to have those points so at negative pi over 2 sine of negative pi over 2 is negative 1. cosecant of negative pi over two is also negative one the reciprocal of negative one is negative one and that happens here and here now the interesting things happen at the zeros so where sine of x equals zero what's the reciprocal of zero well this would be zero over some sort of a constant usually it's zero over one if i reciprocate that that's one over zero and so here's what this means this is one of our key features we're going to write down in a minute is that we're going to have vertical asymptotes everywhere we had an x-intercept for sine so if we have an x-intercept at zero hey sine of zero was zero over one cosecant of zero is one over zero and we're gonna have a vertical asymptote here and at pi and at two pi and at negative pi and at negative two pi every place where we have an x-intercept for sine we're gonna have something that's undefined a vertical asymptote for cosecant so if we're going to base this cosecant x off of sine of x well then we have sine of x we said yep reciprocate and we still have 1 negative 1 negative 1 1. reciprocate our x-intercepts of 0 over 1 we get 1 over zero that's undefined that's vertical asymptotes and there's only one other real value that we we kind of need um that would be this if you have sine of pi over six sine of pi over six is one half remember cosecant is the reciprocal so sine of pi over six is one half cosecant of pi over six is two over one well what that means is that where sine does this cosecant does this the reciprocal is the the in the um the flipping of that fraction so we're going to get everything that's above one and below negative one there's not going to be anything between negative one and one on the graph of cosecant x so sine of pi over six is one half therefore cosecant of pi over six is two and due to the nice symmetry that we get we can kind of extrapolate from this so i didn't put a lot of the pi over 6 and 5 pi over 6 and things like that just because well we kind of know what sine looks like and if we have that one point use some symmetry here on all of our our quarters of our half of our periods um then we can get a really nice graph so this is really what we do for sine and cosine changing into cosecant secant we graph sine we change it into cosecant by just reciprocating points we graph cosine we reciprocate our points we get seeking out of it that's how i'm going to do all of our transformations too is just through this process so let's finish up our graph they're not quite parabolas but they almost look like it it's a really weird graph right i mean sine has is this nice smooth curve has no discontinuity so domain is all real numbers you plug in anything you only get out values between negative one and one because cosecant is the reciprocal we actually can't get out anything between negative one and one negative one is the let's call it um smallest negative value we get and positive one is the smallest positive value that we get in terms of absolute value one is the smallest value that we get so we get all the way down to negative infinity all the way up to positive infinity it's a really look it looks like a disjointed graph i hope it makes sense where it comes from it looks kind of funny because we have to obey our vertical asymptotes our reciprocals told us that we climb if these numbers on sine are between zero and one for this particular portion of our x-axis well then when i reciprocate that i get values larger than one if i reciprocate something very close to zero i'm going to get something very close to infinity and that's what's happening so this is the look the purple is the look for cosecant x it's based on sine of x now let's write a couple things about it firstly the domain because our x-intercepts of sine cause vertical asymptotes for cosecant we're going to have domain problems a vertical asymptote every place we had an x-intercept for sine well that was at 0 and pi and 2 pi and 0 plus k pi i hope you remember that that's what we had for x intercepts well now that's going to cause vertical asymptotes for us and so our domain says we can't have 0 or any multiple of pi from zero that's what that says we can't have zero that's a vertical asymptote it used to be an x-intercept for sine now we reciprocate we get a vertical asymptote zero or plus one pi or plus two pi or minus one pi or minus two pi all of those are vertical asymptotes because they came from x-intercepts that should make sense now our range we actually cannot get anything between negative one and one we get above one and we get below negative one and how we write that for our range is negative infinity to negative one we actually do get negative one there is a point there and then one to infinity we actually do get one and everything above that and so that's our that's our range now the period the period is the same as sine so the period is 2 pi you can see that it repeats here's two pi another two pi and it repeats every single two pi so if we had to draw several cycles we would just go four pi and then six pi and then eight pi and we draw the same exact thing very similar to sine in fact i always draw sine first before i draw cosecant and finally the key features of this graph just remember that we get vertical asymptotes every place that we had x-intercepts on sine the reason why i'm saying it that way is because i'm going to encourage you to draw the sine function first for all of our transformations that we're going to do for cosecant draw the sine function first like a dotted line like i've done done draw your vertical asymptotes on x-intercepts and then draw cosecant it's much easier than trying to memorize uh what that that looks like if you have it great but this is a tool to get you to memorize it so that's the idea and that's really it cosecant is the reciprocal of sine we let's go on to secant x so because secant x is the reciprocal of cosine x we're going to base it on cosine that's what i've done for you right here i have this nice dotted line that shows two periods of cosine here's negative two pi zero zero two pi that's two periods we're gonna do exactly the same thing that we did for for cosecant now i hope you remember this i hope that you remember that cosine is like a shifted version of sine it's a phase shift well what that means is that secant should be a phase shift or a shifted version of cosecant and so it that bears out and so we're going to do something very very quick very very similar to what we've done firstly remember that secant is the reciprocal of cosine so if i have 1 and negative 1 negative 1 1 1 well the reciprocal of 1 is still 1 so i'm still going to have points there the reciprocal of negative 1 is still negative i'm going to have points there as well remember cosine of pi over two was zero over one that gave us zero well that means secant is going to be the reciprocal so the secant of pi over 2 is 1 over 0. that's now undefined so we run in the same situation we ran into here that x-intercepts on sine cause vertical asymptotes on cosecant x-intercepts on cosine do the same thing for secant so we're going to have a vertical asymptote at every x intercept for cosine now it still looked really familiar because we just did it but we're going to do something very similar with pi over 3 that we did with pi over 6 cosine of pi over 3 is one-half it's right there so that means secant of pi over three is the reciprocal of one-half or two and due to some symmetry hey it is an even function and using that fact we can get a very similar graph to cosecant that's about how secant x looks it's just the reciprocal of cosine i hope it makes sense i hope that you're seeing where these are coming from this is how i go ahead and graph pretty much all my transformations with cosecant and secant i just grab sine or cosine and then reciprocate it so show these almost parabola like look at things um from the fact that we're reciprocating we know that it's above one or below negative one here the same thing our range is either below negative one or above positive one we get the same exact range here our domain is it's shifted it is shifted notice that this is a shifted over version of this it's a phase shift that's all it is but what our our domain is going to be is every place where we had an x intercept on cosine we now got a vertical asymptote for secant that happens at pi over 2 plus k pi so plus pi over 2 plus pi would be here pi over 2 minus pi minus another pi we're going to get a vertical asymptote at all those things so let's write that out our domain says yeah because it's based on cosine and because x intercepts happened at pi over 2 and every multi plus every multiple of pi we say that x cannot equal pi over 2 plus any multiple of pi that's going to give us some problems it's going to give us x intercepts for c for cosine and therefore vertical asymptotes for secant our range is the same thing that we got for cosecant x and so is our period because this is based on cosine a period of 2 pi is the same for both uh cosec cosecant sine secant and and cosine so they all have the same period there now it looks a little funny because the period here cuts our graph right in half so that's a little bit awkward a lot of times we're going to kind of think of this as one part one period especially when we have actually for inverses we think about a little bit differently we have to cut it so it's one to one but we can sort of alter where we think of that starting or stopping so anyhow our period is two pi and the key the key idea here is that this is based on cosine what that means because it's a reciprocal function is that where we had x-intercepts on cosine we're now going to have vertical asymptotes and that's really about it so what i'm going to show you now is just two examples of how we can do some transformations with cosecant x and with secant x and i'm going to base them on sine and cosine all right let's do an example about a transformation we'll have one more after this one let's take a look at four secant one half x here's the first thing that i do because i'm so very comfortable with cosine and sine what i do is i graph this if i pretend i pretend that that is the result whatever the reciprocal function is i pretend that that is cosine for just a second i graph a dotted line version of cosine and then i reciprocate it for me that's a lot easier than actually trying to remember what secant looks like and where that period is in my head that's quite hard to do or at least it used to be and so this is the way that i practice doing that and so what i'm going to do right now i'm going to pretend that that's for cosine one-half x now it doesn't help if you can't remember that secant is the reciprocal of cosine and not sine so that is a problem um i've seen a lot of students forget and do cosecant is the reciprocal of cosine because they both have co in it it's not it's opposite so the reciprocal of secant is cosine the reciprocal of cosine is secant and so i'm going to draw i'm going to draw four cosine one half x because secant is the reciprocal it's going to work just fine for us we're going to graph a dotted line version between negative 4 and 4 in this particular case we'll see that with the transformation and so what i've done is really made this like several videos ago i'm just going to do this as far as transformations are concerned i'm going to do all the transformations on that particular function and then just reciprocate it's going to be very easy so let's take a look at it if i'm just going to graph 4 cosine 1 half x i'm going to first look for a vertical shift now we don't have any but that's what we would do first hopefully you remember that that we would shift up or down based on whatever's being added subtracted then i'd find my period and put it on my graph it's super convenient because the period for both secant and cosine or 2 pi remember that the period that we have to find for this particular function is 2 pi because that's both cosine and secant divided by whatever that is so dividing by one half is really multiplying by two this is going to give us four pi i stop right there and i start putting this on my graph you're also going to notice that i go a little bit too i go at least a full period to the right and i go at least a half a period to the left and the reason is is because especially with secant this is going to cut part of that graph it's going to look a little funny so i always do half a period to the left as well try that hopefully it'll benefit you as well so i'm going to do 4 pi so four pi half of that's two pi then we have our first quarter pi and our third quarter three pi and i've done negative pi and negative two pi this is half a period to the left and that's what i want i want to show that so i get a complete graph out of this i don't want to start cutting it so try that on your own too make sure you do at least a full period to the right and half a period to the left over the over the y axis now we're going to have to deal with our key points so remember that our key points for cosine are we have x-intercepts at the quarters so first quarter and third quarter give x-intercepts remember that with cosine we have the start of the period comma one at the middle we have negative one at the end we have positive one so those give us our three key points for cosine i really hope you remember that i hope that you remember with cosine because i'm i mean i really do need you to know that um because if we're going to basis on cosine that we really need to understand that's why we did the video that first so cosine says yeah if you have one period then you're going to put that into four four quarters so the the start and the end the midpoint and then the two quarters first and third so with cosine you start with a period at one and then you go first quarter zero second quarter that's right in the middle negative one third quarter zero fourth quarter at positive one that's what we have we have start at zero one then the first quarter we have an x intercept great at the second quarter or right in the middle we have negative one we're going to be down here at the third quarter we have an x-intercept and the fourth quarter the very end of it we're going to have positive one again now because we have this this factor because that four yeah we're going to affect our key points but i hope that you're seeing what's based on all cosine says is yeah take your your start your middle and your end those are your key points now multiply 1 and negative 1 by that 4. and what this is done is this is going to vertically stretch this graph of cosine it's also going to because we're going to reciprocate it vertically stretch the graph of secant this also is taking and horizontally stretching out our period into four pi it's twice as long as normal and so it's going to make it really wide so a stretched out and stretched out graph so we're gonna we're gonna plot that right now again with cosine you really need to know that the x-intercepts happen the quarters and the peaks and the valleys happen at this at the center and at the ends and that's how what our key points do because we're basing this on a key point idea because we have that just multiply whatever your output factor is that that factor times your outputs and we have that so let's do 0 4 2 pi comma negative 4 and 4 pi comma positive four we'll also get negative 2 pi comma negative 4 because of that idea that would be the center of a period we're going to get the same exact key point out of that and now we graph it now i'm going to use the dotted line because i don't want to confuse this with the graph we're trying to get she's going to do this now that we have that graph of cosine it's really easy to do the graph of secant all we need to understand is that because this is a reciprocal vertical asymptotes are going to occur at our x-intercepts just like that now all we have to do is remember that secant is the reciprocal so we still have these points on secant let's just graph above and below as the case may be and we get a very nice graph of 4 secant one-half x it has the same period it's going to have the vertical asymptotes where x-intercepts were on cosine of the same type of function we just we just base it on that cosine this is what i've found is the easiest i hope it works for you i hope you're seeing the interplay and it's a really good tool it's really good for remembering that secant is based on cosine it'll help you to remember that and it'll help you to graph with a lot of transformations especially like phase shifts and things like that so hopefully technique works for you i'm going to come back with one more okay last one we're going to take a look at negative 2 cosecant 2 pi over 3 x minus 2. that's a lot going on the first thing i'm going to do is think about the reciprocal function the reciprocal function is sine and so i'm going to think of this as sine now with that shift with that that shift in my head of okay i'm dealing with sign now i'm going to go through the entire process with sine and just draw cosecant above and below it not a big deal so this has a vertical shift of down 2. i'm going to write that i'm going to show that then i'm going to find the period the period for sine and cosecant is both 2 pi so we're going to take 2 pi and divide by 2 pi over 3. so two pi divided by two pi over three the two pi's are gonna cancel you get one divided by one third that's three so i'm going to show that and just for fun i did two periods here so i did two cycles of this so remember our period is three this would be one cycle two cycles three cycles so i did i have three periods of this sine function right now then what i do is i find my key points remember that with sine our x-intercepts happen at the beginning middle and end of each period so we have x-intercept here and here and here that's our beginning middle and end of that first period remember the period is three not six and then we're going to have key points at our quarters so positive one and negative one at the quarters so we'd have originally what we would do here is we would have the first quarter positive one third quarter negative one and so we've shown that we figured out our period first that we would know our quarters we have that down and now we're going to modify that that negative 2 is going to multiply the outputs so that's going to stretch this and reflect it so there are actually four transformations there's a shift down two there's a very slight horizontal sorry uh actually considerable horizontal compression from two pi into three and now we have a vertical stretch and a reflection so we're going to take that multiply the outputs of our key points let's go ahead and plot that now please remember with this key point technique it works from where you shifted to so rx intercepts yeah they're really not x-intercepts they're they're on this shifted version that's what we do it's just a nice graphic organizer i know it's not really there but it's a very good place to graph from you can see especially when we graph that cosecant function and now we're going to go ahead and say hey the first quarter was originally first quarter one it's been stretched and reflected now it's first quarter negative two but from here so first quarter negative two third quarter positive two we're going to graph that and we can mimic that in the next period and the previous period and get a very similar type of graph in both those those intervals so that is the graph of negative two sine two pi over three x minus two shifted down compressed horizontally stretched vertically and reflected i am just really hoping that you understand the interplay between the key points what that does and how it is done from where you shifted to this acts like your x-axis for this technique i've been teaching in a long time now that we've done that all we have to do is understand that where our x-intercepts are we're now going to have vertical asymptotes and i hope you see why i'm teaching you this technique with the key points interacting with that that sort of new xy x-axis is because the vertical asymptotes interact with that too so where our x-intercepts are here on this is where you're going to get those vertical asymptotes that's why this technique works so well so all we have to do now is understand that well cosecant is cosecant is the reciprocal of sine and so we graph from these local maxima and minimum and we get a fairly decent look for relatively little work if we really needed to we could erase the sine function here and get a nice cosecant function that that is the solid graph is this negative 2 cosecant 2 pi over 3x minus 2. i hope you like the technique um it's what i've come up with is the best way to graph it without really having to put in a lot of time because we're so good at sine and cosine just think about sine and cosine with your key points remember that you have to shift and treat that like your x-axis and then everything falls into place use your first quarter and your third quarter for sine as far as your key points and your ends and center for cosine and then reciprocate to get cosecant and secant for sine and cosine respectively one more thing please remember that because the range of cosecant and secant is negative v to negative one and one to infinity you will not get x intercepts on those graphs there aren't any x-intercepts on cosecant or secant until you start shifting them around like we've done here so i hope that makes sense to you as well they don't exist unless you start shifting it we have some here but that's just because we shifted down so far all right i hope that makes sense have a great day i'll see you for another video you
