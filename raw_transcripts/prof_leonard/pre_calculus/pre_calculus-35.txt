Transcript for: Introduction to Complex Solutions of Polynomials (Precalculus - College algebra 35)
hey there welcome to another video in this video we're going to have a brief introduction of complex zeros of polynomials we're going to be using them in the next few videos to take some complex zeros and build polynomials from them and how to factor polynomials completely over complex numbers so let's explore a little bit about it what a complex zero is where they come from what you can do with them and how far we can factor polynomials if we allow complex numbers so um one thing that we i've been speaking of i never wrote it down but one thing i've been speaking of is this this fact of polynomials is that every polynomial can be factored over the real number system into linear or irreducible quadratic factors linears giving you x-intercepts like either crossings or bounces touches touchings where we have a multiple root multiplicity would be even there or irreducible quadratics which do not yield x-intercepts because they give you complex solutions and that's what we're going to start talking about is those complex solutions just a little bit right now how they work and next few videos will unpack that and go into creating functions from them so effective polynomials is that they can be factored into linears and irresistible quadratics over the real number system now if we allow complex solutions then we can continue factoring and if you had a polynomial you could factor that into all linear factors if you allow complex solutions which is fascinating and here's what that means here's the whole thing that you really need to get if you're going to allow complex solutions for a polynomial then the degree of your polynomial no longer means at most this many x-intercepts and that's what we had before if you had a degree 12 you could potentially have 12 x-intercepts some might be repeated some might be crossing some might be bouncings but you could have 12 of them but that's not a guarantee that you will have 12. if you allow complex numbers then if we factor that into linears here's what it means your degree equals the number of factors you're going to get because they all be linear every linear has a power 1 as its largest power so if you had a degree 12 then you would factor that into 12 factors some might be repeated but you would get 12 factors if you allow complex numbers for those solutions so the degree now means number of linear factors if you love complex and it means number of solutions so if you saw a degree 12 polynomial you are going to be able to factor that into 12 factors and get 12 solutions exactly but that is over the real the complex number system so you have things like with i in it so we're going to review that a little bit like what complex numbers look like what a conjugate means and then this nice little fact i'll talk about so what a conjugate means is two terms with basically a different sign in the middle the first term doesn't change its sign the second term does change its sign so if we had a plus b then a conjugate would be a minus b if we had a plus b i then the conjugate would be a minus b i now why do we need to know that well that's that's what a complex number looks like it's a real part plus or minus some imaginary part and an imaginary number comes from a square root of a negative number and that's where that comes from so complex numbers are huge so here's the main thing that we need to understand about complex numbers every complex solution is going to come in what's called a conjugate pair so if you get this solution 3 2 minus 3i we are guaranteed that there's another complex solution 2 plus 3i that is what is called a complex conjugate pair so notice how the real part doesn't change notice how the imaginary part does change sign we're going to talk about why that is in just a little while but they always pair up like that you might remember from last few videos so i said well you know what if we're factoring we might get these irreducible quadratics now what do they do they create two solutions that are complex what are those two solutions they're repaired every irreducible quadratic creates a complex pair of solutions complex conjugate pair just like that every irreducible quadratic is going to do that why why is it irreducible because you can't factor it over real numbers because you can only factor irreducible quadratics over complex numbers they're still going to have two solutions quadratic is a power two similar two solutions but they're going to be complex solutions and they're going to look like this real part plus an imaginary and minus that same imaginary so uh let's do another one if you had negative seven plus five i the complex conjugate would be negative seven you don't change that but you change the middle sign minus 5i those are what are called complex conjugate pairs now i want you to understand why they exist i just told you that these complex conjugates come from irreducible quadratics so think about what a quadratic would look like a quadratic would be ax squared plus bx plus c and if you set it equal to zero you'd say okay if i wanted to find solutions i would try to factor it you know well what if it's not factorable i'd use quadratic formula you go okay so so get this if every polynomial can be factored into linear or irreducible quadratics linear gives you x-intercepts over real numbers that's what it does that's all it does um if they're to the an odd power they're crosses and if they're to an even power their balances that's what they do irreducible quadratics give you complex solutions now here's why so this is true and it is true that we can get all the way down to linears and initial quadratics no power fours no power threes no part of fives only factored into linears power ones or quadratics power twos then when we got here and you go well it's not factorable what would i do i would use the quadratic formula for irreducible quadratics well now i don't want you to worry about the linears those are already factored we'd have x-intercepts from them but if you think about the quadratic formula here let's really look at it if i had a reducible quadratic something that i could factor i really wouldn't do this i would just factor this normally or if i if i use the quadratic formula because i wasn't able to factor this over integers or rationals or something like that well then i would have at least negative b plus or minus some positive number in here and that would create two more linear factors over real numbers so wait a minute what causes something to be irreducible it's irreducible if this number is called the discriminant the number inside of your square root if this number were negative i'll just use negative number in here what happens if there's a negative number inside of your square root well this would yield an imaginary number it would yield this something i like square root 7i or 3i if you had like 9 square root of 9 negative 9 in there you get 3i you're going to get something with an i in it now take a look at this this negative b that's a real part this does not change signs at all there's no plus and minus in front of that that negative b this is your real part it's like the two it's like the negative seven it's the first part of a complex number but look at the second part the second part would be plus and minus this square root of a negative number something imaginary remember you can't combine a real part with an imaginary part without a sign in the middle you can't say hey what's 3 plus 2i but it's 3 plus 2i it's like apples and oranges you don't get up oranges that sounds weird you just get a complex number it's two numbers sort of mashed together but it's that plus and minus the quadratic formula that guarantees that we get pairs of complex numbers you'd have this being something plus or minus the same number it's not going to change but you are going to get two different signs there that is what creates these complex conjugate pairs if we can factor a polynomial into linears that gives us x intercepts irreducible quadratics gives us something we use the quadratic formula for that has a real part plus or minus an imaginary part that's why they come in pairs that's why irreducible quadratics always give us complex solutions and irreducible sorry and conjugate pairs for those complex solutions so this part would basically be wrapped up as if i split that fraction some real part let's just call it a whatever it is plus or minus some sort of a number that has i in it i know i'm kind of messing up with my b here this this b is a different b than that i really shouldn't use it but i wanted to model that up there and so this is where it comes from is the this quadratic formula saying this first part if i split the fraction would be the real part plus or minus some imaginary part but the a and the b themselves would not change value that's why they always come in pairs it's just because of that plus and minus so what does that mean for us and this is where we're going to end our our lesson today is that if we understand all this stuff if we understand that when we start using complex numbers we can take those irreducible quadratics and we can factor them further over complex numbers x minus two plus three i x minus two plus three i i think i said the same thing twice x x minus that one and x minus that one so you can have these two different factors if we use complex solutions well those are both linear and what that means is that if we allow complex we can get whatever your degree is that number of factors and that number of solutions well let's look at a degree 6 polynomial if we have a degree six polynomial then we are going to have to have six solutions or six zeros some of which though might be complex however if you have a complex they always come in pairs so let's look through it if i have this degree six polynomial i need six solutions two is a real number you don't mess with that and that's done two plus i is a complex number so i'd be looking for its complex conjugate to also appear if it does cool if it doesn't well then i know that i have an initial an additional zero that's not being listed so i would say degree six one two three four i'm missing two zeros i have to have the equal number of zeros for the degree if we are including complex numbers which we are here so the two that's a real solution that stands for an x-intercept in this case and it's a cross in this case the two plus three is two plus i says i also would have to have its complex conjugate so 2 minus 3i negative 3 minus i says well wait a minute i also need those to be paired every complex solution will be paired up guaranteed i just explained why it's because quadratic formula the plus and minus creates that pair automatically for any irreducible quadratic formula irreducible is only over real numbers start a lot of complex well then we do reduce them but they come in pairs that would be negative three plus i and then zero zero is also a real solution so we would look at this and go there's one two three four five six zeros that's six solutions including complex numbers and that's a degree six that will always match if we are using complex solutions again if this is over reals we say that degree is the maximum number of real solutions we could have not necessarily all of them will be real in this case four solutions will be complex is it true that you'll always have an even number of complex solutions yes because they always come in pairs so if you have one you have two if you have three you have four at least um or well if you have some pairs you could have a pair and then one and another one so this is probably an act this is an x-intercept that's crossing an x-intercept that's crossing and then four complex solutions how i know those are crossing is because we have six solutions for that degree six therefore none of these can be repeated so that's kind of interesting let's move on to the last one we're gonna be done so degree seven polynomial in your head right now you should be thinking degree seven polynomial is going to have seven solutions if i allow complex numbers it will have a maximum of seven solutions if i'm talking about real numbers so let's look at it oh hey so we see some complex that means that every complex solution has to have a pair with it according to the quadratic formula because when we evaluate the quadratic formula with an irreducible quadratic we're going to get a complex number we are going to get a real plus or minus an imaginary that creates a pair of complex numbers so what are they well let's start with this one 3 minus 2y would have to have a pair 3 plus 2i negative 2 plus i has to have a pair negative 2 minus i notice i'm not changing the sign of the real number this doesn't change this a is the real part the plus and minus the where the sign changes is in the second part the imaginary part so 3 stays that sign changes negative 2 stays that sign changes negative 4 is a real solution those do not have to come in pairs that's just negative 4. why well because if this is not negative and we just erased that then that's a real number and that's also a real number and you can combine them and so especially if they're integers or something like that you can combine real with real it's only when that is imaginary that you cannot combine these two parts and so therefore when we have a real solution it wouldn't show up as a pair only complex do that because you have a real part and an imaginary part that you're kind of sort of mashing together with a plus or a minus that's where the pair comes in and so we'd leave the negative four the only other one that we have to deal with is this i so this i would happen if you had let's see a zero plus or minus the square root of negative one so zero for your b plus or minus square root of negative one but it is a complex number we just have to understand that this is probably best thought of as zero plus i so we'd have zero which is your real part there is no real part here there's just an imaginary part zero plus i the conjugate would be zero minus i so the conjugate to this would be negative i you don't need the zero but that's the way that i'm gonna explain that to you and so these would be our seventh solution so i would yield a complex conjugate pair of negative i that's a pair that would be like zero plus or minus square of negative one that'd be uh zero plus i zero minus i hey that's where that comes from we'd have 3 minus 2i 3 plus 2i negative 4 does not yield a pair because i just explained that to you real numbers get added and subtracted and create another real number and then we'd have negative 2 plus sign negative two minus sign that's one two three four five six seven there's only one real solution here it's just negative four there's only one real x intercept here that's negative four the rest are complex zeros or complex solutions so that negative four would be a cross this would have to be a degree seven seven solutions degree seven that's odd every odd polynomial must cross the x axis at least one time it can cross and never come back again but it would have to cross i've been saying that for a while but now maybe you start are seeing that picture i also said that with the cartridge signs you reduce by two because of the irreducible quadratics that irreducible quadratic basically takes two away from the degree at a time why well because if you are having an irreducible quadratic and use a quadratic formula it yields two solutions that are complex every single time that takes away two solutions from the degree in pairs conjugate pairs for every time you have an irreversible quadratic so i hope that's starting to kind of gel in your head kind of solidify about how complex solutions work with our degree how we get the equal number to the degree for our solutions and for our factors and we factor over complex numbers so in the next few videos we're going to start building functions from these uh these complex solutions we're going to basically take this and create a polynomial from it so i'll see you for that
