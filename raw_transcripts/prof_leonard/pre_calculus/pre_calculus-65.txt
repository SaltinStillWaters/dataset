Transcript for: Review of Compound Interest (Precalculus - College Algebra 65)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about interest just one application of how exponentials and logarithms can work together to solve some financial problems for us I'm not going to be teaching this at length because we've already I've already talked about interest in a lot of other places uh on the channel uh this should be and you should have seen it before somewhere you should have seen compound interest uh what we're going to do here is just a brief review if you've never seen it before it's not a problem I will teach you well enough for you to understand it um and then we'll focus on what we really should be getting to like solving for how long it would take to double an investment or how long it would take to reach a certain goal uh finding some other missing variables not just plugging in like these two examples will illustrate but I will illustrate that also you will need a calculator because we can't do this stuff in our head so hopefully have one handy and let's get started so one application of of exponentials is this type of growth now interestingly open intended is that when we talk about interest growth it is an exponential modeling and that's also the same type of modeling as natural growth or natural Decay if it's uninhibited and we'll talk about that in the next video so really fascinating stuff that exponentials can be used to model some real life things for us that were very used to um so we're going to take a look at compound interest whether it's compounded annually semiannually quarterly monthly weekly daily or continuously there's two different formulas that you need to know so let's go ahead let's review those formulas and we'll get right into it so these are the compound interest formulas for compounded continuously and compounded for some finite number of compounds per year now in a typical finance class I usually go ahead and and and drive these so I tell you exactly where they come from U from simple interest to compound but that's not really the nature of this course we're just using this to model uh some financial instruments with exponentials so here's what these words mean if you have not been exposed to it or just forgotten what they are so let me take a look at these two formulas what the P stands for in both cases is something called the principle or present value of your investment or your loan uh so either way when we talk about compound interest the same formula uh every time you borrow money someone's loaning it so every single time interest is Chang in hand someone is making it and someone is giving it interest is this cost of borrowing money uh so the p is what the money's worth when you start your investment or start your borrowing so it's called the present value or the principle a is the future value so it's what the money is going to be worth to somebody at the very end of this this investment let's say um or the total amount we can say so that's what the a stands for it's what everything would be like if you borrowed five grand then at the end of however many years you're going to pay back five grand plus interest the cost of borrowing that $5,000 for this length of time that you've agreed to uh you see there's there's certain amount of risk and and there's a certain amount of I'm without my money if you loan money to someone so when you invest money you're you're basically loaning money to someone else to use whether that's a bank or private individual or the stock market whatever wherever you're putting your money you're loaning it to someone to do stuff with uh and so that's that idea of making interest well someone's paying you interest uh they're borrowing your money for a certain amount of time even Banks do this when you put your bank your money in a bank account take that money they do a whole lot other stuff with it they make money and they give you a little bit in return and that's why at the end of the month your bank account goes up however much money you have have in there uh it determines how how quickly that's going to rise so anyhow so p is our present value a is our amount or sometimes called our future value R is an interest rate it's always written as a decimal so even though they're going to give it to you as a percentage you're going to write as a decimal we're going to move the decimal place two spots to the left because we're dividing by 100 to remove that percentage all these formulas work in decimal rather than percent notation for our our values for interest rate then we talked about T T is time yes but it's always in terms of years because our interest rate is given in terms of years and so this is always based on years and then we have a choice whether we're going to choose compounded continuously or compounded not continuously depend on what the problem is telling us to do if we have continuously compounded interests we have a special formula now you notice that e there it's really fascinating that continuously compounded interest is natural uninhibited growth the same exact thing that we're going to get in the next video talking about population growth or of like bacteria or things like this it be modeled well by this that's going to become an a sub zero that's going to become an a of T other than that that'll be a k rather than an R uh be a type of growth rate rather than a type of interest rate but the same exact thing I'm going to point you back to this so when we talk about growing money we really are we're growing money like we are a population uh of bacteria except that instead of bacteria this the money is dollars and cents rather than cells um so anyhow this would be for continuous growth but notice it has an a a p an r and a t now this has an n and a lot of people get confused on what that n is if you are not continuously compounded then you're going to be compounded for a finite number of times in one year that finite number is called n so n is the number of compounds that your investment let's say or loan receives in one year's time well that means there's a special word that has to go along with these problems if we're not compounded continuously we're compounded monthly or annually or daily weekly whatever so when we read through that that number of compounds that's happen in one year's time that's our n so for annual annually compounded interest you're only getting interest one time a year at the very end of the year semiannually would be two and we split it evenly and then we work our way down quarterly would mean four monthly would mean 12 weekly there's 52 weeks in year and daily 365 so if you were to receive daily compounded interest you would get a little bit interest every day for the entire year now that sounds really good like I want that one and in general it is better if you're if you're um if you're loaning money or making invest to receive more interest quicker so you want interest as often as possible continuously it would be great so what's continuously mean continuously means every moment of every minute of every SEC of every hour of every day of every month of every year you're getting a little teeny bit of Interest however I want you to notice something here it sounds really good but what does the N practically do the n takes the rate which is yearly interest it's always in terms of years and divides it so if I'm taking my interest rate let's say um let's say 10% and I divide by n well the larger my n gets the smaller this this number gets one plus that's going to be very very very close to one if I have really really really big numbers and then I I take it to an exponent but notice I'm taking one plus some small number to an exponent yeah this will grow but practically what n does is this it says I'm going to divide your interest rate into a certain number why would I do that let's talk about monthly if I were to get monthly compounded interest I'm going to get one 12th of my interest every year or sorry every month so it take let's say 12% and would divide it I get 1% the first month 1% the second month 1% the third month and then by the end of the year I would have got 12% of Interest now what what what's the N doing times the T well if you're getting monthly compound interest how many times are you getting interest in one year Well you getting interest 12 times well that's for every single year so n Cuts your rate and multiplies your years if it's the number of times you're getting interest in one year's time that should make a little bit of sense this doesn't have that why well it's a funny little thing that we have as n gets larger and larger and larger and larger and larger and larger and larger and larger so how how many moments are in a year Well it's not just a number of seconds right there's an infinite number of moments in a second uh so there's an infinite number of moments in a year also like a lot of moments so if your interest is continuously compounding you're getting a little interest every single moment well there's an infinite number of moments but it's really hard to plug an Infinity to something well what this ends up being you can see this is modeled on this to some thing going to Infinity this actually ends up being e you can figure this out in calculus to but this ends up being e so if you take your n to like Infinity this part of your compound interest formula becomes e practically that's a really simplistic way to talk about it but that's what's happening that's why we have two different formulas so what we're going to do is we're going to practice putting this into place we'll see how the N affects this as we go through if that didn't make a whole lot of sense to you it should because we've SE it before but uh it might be time for refresh room so let's take a look at it $3,000 is invested at 9 and 1/4% compounded monthly for two and a half years what we need to understand is a couple things about it number one what formula am I using for each case number two what my key letters mean up here so let's start understanding this uh firstly when we are investing or borrowing that doesn't really matter what we're looking for is what our p is what are what the problem is asking you what our p is what our a is what all of these things are so when we take a look at $3,000 is invested 94% compound monthly the first thing that's popping into my head is am I trying to Sol what am I trying to solve for in this case I'm trying to figure out my future value I'm trying to solve for my a well that means I have to be given a p an R an n and a t or be told it's compounded continuously so let's try to try to do that so if I'm if I know I'm trying to find my future value I need to be given a p so I'm looking for my P it says $3,000 is is invested that's called your principal or present value what that means is this right now in this moment in time if you were to do this today your money's going to be worth $3,000 that's the present value of what you're investing it's invested at 9 and A4 per. okay well that is an annual interest rate and we always write it as a decimal so we move our decimal two spots left because when you change from a percentage to a decimal notation you divide by 100 because uh 1 equals 100% you're divided by 100% dividing by one it's giving the same value with a different look compounded monthly this is the determination of when you use which formula so if this is compounded continuously we have a formula for that this is compounded and gives you a finite amount in a year monthly daily weekly Etc then we think okay how many compound a month to me how many times do months happen in a year how many compounds am I going to get in a year well that would be 12 now that we have some numbers on the board this will make a little more sense look at what the 12 does the 12 takes your annual interest rate and divides it into 12 little pieces why because you're getting each of those pieces one every single month so one of those pieces every month well that means I'm getting it 12 times for those 2 and A2 years I'm getting it 12 times for those two and a half years practically speaking that's 30 times does that make sense if you're getting interest once a month for two and a half years you will get interest 30 times so it divides your annual interest rate the amount that you're going to get every year by 12 so you get it a little bit a month and then says yes you're doing this for 30 months rather than like two and a half years it translates it into the number of compounds that you get that's what that does compounds time year is total number of compounds that you have that's practically what the formula does uh I'm going to give you a a really helpful hint for your calculators most calculators need this to be in parenthesis or it will not work now what it would do if you don't have parenthesis it would do this in order operation as an exponent and if you don't have parentheses there it would multiply your result by 2.5 and we don't want to do that we want make sure that we have this in parentheses so that we get the the full amount also another piece of advice uh man don't be writing stuff down here like I know I usually tell you write down lots of steps but don't write things down because you'll have to round it and we're deal with some really sensitive numbers where the all the decimals matter practically speaking and so if we start rounding things and then we start taking them to exponents and then we start multiplying then we start rounding again we're going to be off by maybe just pennies but that matters financially so we want to be as accurate as possible so the way to go through this is determine which formula write it down have parentheses right here use your calculator so plug it in exactly how it looks right here so 3,000 left parentheses 1 plus you can just do your decimal press divide by 12 write parenthesis exponent button and then put a parentheses there so put your parenthesis write in your number of compounds times years end parentheses and then press equals you should take a moment to try that so what I got out of this was $3,777 17 rounded to the penny should be always rounded to the penny generally yeah um if you have directions to say round to the nearest Dollar that'd be fine I do also want to tell you that when you're talking about things like mortgages that's almost rounded always rounded to the dollar um and we almost always round it up because we don't want to be short on our our investment or our loan so typically even if this had been if we had round to the penny uh like I did here at 17 that's fine but a lot of times financial institutions no matter how much that that next number is will round that to an eight even if it's 171 it' round it to a 18 cents it 17 so just something to keep in mind so you have to read those directions a little carefully so that's it here's what that means that means that that in the future in 2 and a half years what this money is going to be worth to someone the future value of it is $3,777 2017 that is how much is going to be in your account after you make this investment and Let It Go for exactly two and a half years that's what's going to be there you will have received interest every month for those two and a half years 9 and 1/4% interest divided by 12 says that's how much interest you would receive every month added to your amount and then you do that for whatever the 30 the 30 months is I hope that makes sense you I hope you're seeing why the formula works I went into a little bit more detail about this than I planned but hopefully hopefully you're sticking with me on that uh one more thing that I do want to say and I will say at the very end but I want to start prefacing now is that because compound interest adds interest before the term of your loan or investment you will end up getting more than 9.25% in one year why because after one month you get a little money right and then for the next month you you're getting interest on your original amount but also on the part that was added that little bit of interest and so it ends up being more interest at the end of one year than 9 and a qu% that's called the effective yield typically and so I'll show you how to find that at the very end um so that you understand like what the simple interest equivalent to compound interest would be so we'll get there in a little bit okay what about compounded continuously it's the same exact idea we have the same exact numbers it's just a different formula so if you say if you read it it says compounded finite number that's called an N use that formula finite sorry compounded continuously not a finite number you must use that e so it's a little simpler actually uh we go ahead and we put 3,000 that's our principle or present value e is a constant order number natural number raised to the rate times the time and years notice there's no compounding because it's always being compounded it's an infinite number of compounds that's what that e sort of wraps up for you and we use our calculator most calculators when you press second Ln will put an e there with an exponent and parenthesis there's not much you you have to do but we do want to make sure that that does come in parenthesis um it should show up automatically on your calculator and rounded to the penny we have $3,780 52 now this comes as a surprise to a lot of people wait a minute I thought it'd be more because here we're getting interest only 12 times a year here we're getting interest every single moment of every second every minute every hour every day every month of every year that's a whole lot of times you get interest in the grand scheme it's a little over $3 over two and a half years so is it more will will continuously compounded interest always get get you more than anything using this formula yes but it's not as significant as some other things u in finance we really explore this we say what what are the big factors that would cause you to make more money or lose more money number one generally it's it's the interest rate the interest rate is a huge factor in earning or owing a lot of money uh so when we're investing want that pretty high right as high as we can get it and still be secure U if we're borrowing want that as low as possible and that's the one thing that makes the most difference after that it's length of time uh so the length of time really affects how much interest you're going to earn or owe at the end of your your investment or loan respectively all right let's move right along so we got another type of problem this is really what I'm going to focus on finding some missing variables rather than just plugging in to a formula so let's take a look how much should be invested at 85% compounded daily to earn $800 in 3 and a/4 years when you deal with these problems really think through what am I looking for uh because everything else should be should be given to you or be be able to be found but you want to be able to identify what variable you're missing and which formula you're using pretty much at the same time so how much should be invested at okay right there we can stop we can stop how much should be invested what are they asking you for are they missing the amount the present value the rate the years or the compounds if they're saying how much should be invested they're asking um what is the the value of the amount of money that you want to put in right now so that's the present value we're missing the present value that means we're going to have to be able to determine the the future value the amount uh the rate that's our interest the time that's our years and possibly a number of compounds or determine that continuously compounded so we should be able to look for those things all right how much should we invested I know that I'm searching for a p the rest of this should be filled out at 8 and 1 12% okay there's my rate 8 and half% compounded daily so I was reading the daily understand that this is going to be our traditional compound interest formula da daily that's a lot of compounds that's actually 365 compounds what that means is that you would take your annual comp your annual interest rate that 8.55% if you divide it by 365 this is the amount of Interest you're going to get every single day you'll take your principal or whatever's in your bank at that time multiply it by that amount that's what you would get every single day however because you're getting a lot of times well you're getting that that little amount of Interest a whole lot of times 365 times a year for three 3 and a/4 years I'm going to certainly put that in parenthesis that's really important for your calculator so we've determined that we're using compound interest with an N because it's giving us a finite number of compounds in one years time not continuous you use this for everything that's not continuously compounded we've determined that it's asking us how much should be invested that's a present value so we're missing the P we write that down it's given us a rate it's given us a number of compounds that 365 giv us a number of years three and a quarter and says how much we want okay so to earn $800 so if we're going to earn $800 or have that amount out that would be our future value for this money now that is worded a little bit poorly uh that's kind of ambiguous as to well would you earn $800 in interest or would you earn $800 total um if you had to do it another way then you would have to have a p plus 800 over here to get a lot more complicated so maybe a better way to word that what I intended on the problem is uh how much should be invested 8.5% compounded daily to have $800 in the account at the end of three and a qu years that's what I intended just it's poorly worded I'm sorry about that so moving on to how to solve this if we understand that we're solving for p and p is multiplied by all this junk all we've got to do is really divide it so if we divide both sides by this whole amount don't don't try to figure out this stuff and write down an approximation as a decimal don't be doing that because we don't want to be rounding any of this your calculator will handle this at one whole step if you just plug it in with those parentheses so when we divide both sides it solves 4 P for us when we evaluate this on our calculator we put put in 00 press divide and use a big bracket so use a parenthesis then use another parenthesis so this really should be like this it doesn't matter on some calculators but others it might so use a parentheses another parentheses 1 + 85 365 in parentheses exponent button make sure that's in parentheses and then close that up if you need to and press enter I got $66.99 now why is that less than 800 because 800's your goal we want to invest something less than that to ear to get $800 in our account at the end of this um how much how about this how much interest did you earn here could you figure that out in the these examples well if you know that you plugged in uh $66.99 as an investment and you ultimately got $800 in your account and if you subtract those two the difference is your interest so we can always find that uh that interest amount by taking the future value subtracting the present value what the rest of it is interest let's look at compounded continuously so if we dealt with the same thing the formula is actually a bit easier we know that we're still searching for our P we know that we want to have $800 in our account at the end of three and a quarter years under a rate of 8 sorry 5% and that's compounded continuously so we're using the correct formula we just plugged in the appropriate things 800 left that e is e is e it's not a variable R was that 85 and then 3 and a/4 years so if we understand that this is still multiplication we can divide both sides by this entire expression and your calculator would do it just like this 800 / second Ln it brings up parentheses for you on most cases plug in your your interest rate times your years and then you should give about $6.90 slightly less than what this is because continuously compound interest will always give you more interest than anything else with non-continuously compounding so if that's the case it would require us to invest less money to have the same amount with the same rate and the same amount of time because we're you compounding it quicker we're earning interest faster in this hope that's making sense to you I hope you're seeing that we can do some other things besides just use the formula one way we'll come back with one more example where we uh we try to double our investment we'll take a look at that and it'll be done okay last two so same example we're just going to do it twice so you see uh how to deal with continuously compound interest again so how long does it take to double an investment at 4 and a half% interest compound accordly and you go well what's the size of the investment it doesn't matter whether you invest a dollar or a million dollars or a trillion dollars at that interest rate and that compound it's going to take exactly the same amount of time to double both so what are we really asking for here are we asking to find the present value and the future value well not really we know the rate we know the compounds we're asking how long how much time does it take to do this so if we deal with a compounded quarterly a hey you have a iite number of compounds in one year you have this formula it's not continuously compounded if we're dealing with this formula right there then we're really asking to Sol for T well that's that's interesting let's started filling this stuff out so if we're asking to Sol for T I don't know what my P is what's my present value I don't know what my a is which my future value I just told you it didn't matter so show you what you put for that in a minute we do know what our interest rate is and we do know what our compounds are the compounds say compound accordly means four times per year four times for however many years it's going to take hopefully you can read through this and say how long is a I'm solving for the number of years hopefully you can read through and say 4 and a half perents 045 and compound accordly means I'm using that formula it's a finite number of number of compounds in one year's time and that's going to be four now the double in can be tricky the first time you see it so why don't I need an investment well think about this for a second let's say that you invested $5 doubling that would be $10 okay well what's the first thing that you would do because this is multiplied together and because oh man get it because you need a logarithm to solve for that exponent logarithms are the only thing that lets you solve for exponentials without common BAS we certainly don't have that when you are missing a variable in your exponent so logarithms are going to be what it takes but in order to get there you need to isolate that exponential you'd have to divide by five so if I divided both sides by five I'm going to end up getting two equals some sort of an exponential with a really funny base well wait what if it wasn't five what was what it was 50 doubling that would be 100 100 is double of 50 but if I divided by 50 would I still get two yes and that's true for any time you are doubling an investment if you put five or 50 or one it would be a factor of two that's what dou means so it's always going to be two equals some sort of a base depending on your your rate and your number of compounds do you see I hope that you see that what would tripling be well rup would be three quadruple would be four so to keep it easy instead of making up some random amount of present value we we usually say well if it doesn't really matter why not just use one because if I use one doubling one is two so we have this 2 equals really some exponential with a funny base on it and this is exactly what an exponential equation is so how do you solve exponential equations well firstly you isolate the exponential we've done that this is your exponential this is a really awkward base but this is a base right this is a number if you added this in your calculator you would get some constant raised to some exponent that has a variable equal to another constant so how how do you solve it we can choose to do a logarithm on both sides uh what a logarithm on both sides would do is allow to move this exponent to the front and divide and we've done that many many times before which you can't do you can't sit here and say those are common bases so common bases won't do it uh you have to have logarithms also I would discourage you from using a logarithm with this base that's really awkward I'm going to encourage you to use a logarithm with a base of e use an Ln here especially when you get down to compounded continuously we'll see why in a bit but what we're going to do is we're going to take an Ln on both sides so on the left hand side we get ln2 and on the right hand side we get this Ln of 1 + 045 over 4 to the 4T but logarithms let you move exponents called the power property and because those are both multiplied we can divide both sides by the four and this natural log of 1 + 045 over4 notice what I'm not doing I'm not approximating that I'm going to use my calculator so what's the big deal in writing this in parenthesis that way we don't have to write down a round a decimal and get this thing completely wrong uh so I want to make sure that we're we're doing that so I'm trying to solve for T yes that is the number of years I'm going to divide both sides by four and this natural log so ln2 / 4 and also divided by the Ln your calculator will do this just fine so when you do this just make sure because when you press Ln almost always it has a parenthesis that pops up you got to close that parenthesis otherwise it's going to find Ln of 2 / 4 Ln of whatever something else is so close this and then press divide also when you press divide you're going to want to make sure you have another parenthesis this is how it should look when you plug this into your calculator so you press press Ln press two close parenthesis press divide do another parenthesis and then put in all of the stuff exactly how it looks I ended up getting 15.49 years so almost 15 a half years on this remember the t is years that's a long time to double investment but that's exactly how long it would take you to double whatever the present value is whether it's $1 or a billion dollars it doesn't matter if you're going to double it and you're going to give it 4 and a half% compound it quarterly that is how long it's going to take you no matter what your initial investment is hope that makes sense we saw that mathematically but now it should be should be sort of clicking so let's deal with this last one this compounded continuously we'll see that ens are really really nice to use especially with compounded continuously type of Interest so what this idea says how long would it take to double your investment 4 and a half% compounded continuously well continuously as soon as I hear that word I'm thinking that formula so I know I know that I'm looking for the year says how long I know what my rate is 4 and a half% I don't know what my present value is or my future value is but I know the relationship I know that my future value should be twice the present value if it had been tripled you'd put a three here um we can do do this with lots of different things we can say what about um how long would it take to take one amount to another amount given that amount of Interest we just have to know both of those things if it's not giving you a specific uh value like doubling or tripling some sort of factor like that so we have double an investment at 4 and a half% compounded continuously because one times any sort of exponential just giving us back the exponential my one is fairly irrelevant all this is saying is hey you now have an exponential equation there's no way you're getting common bases you're going to have to use logarithms let's use Ln and in a wonderful turn of events we have now composed an exponential onto a logarithm the same base they're going to cancel that's fantastic this becomes even easier than this I hope that you remember that that when you're composing an exponential base of e onto a natural logarithm that's a base of e they're going to simplify you've composed a function with an inverse they have to cancel out and so we end up getting ln2 = 045 T could you have moved this exponent to the front and had a little one here and then used a property Ln of e to the first gives you want you could have but that that's a little bit more work than we need actually all that's required here is now div divide both sides by 045 remember that when you're divide logarithms you really need to close that parenthesis on your on your Ln otherwise it's going to take Ln of 2 divid 045 instead of Ln 2 end it then divide that by 045 so make sure that we're doing that I ended up getting 15 .4 years should it be less than this yes because continuously compounded interest grows faster so this will be slightly less time but not much less time to achieve the same doubling Factor there I hope that this is made sense to you especially this last part uh most of the time you do end up seeing this in like an intermediate algebra class not college algebra well we see it both places uh really but a lot of times this doesn't make sense to an intermediate algebra student uh and if that was you hopefully the second time around then this is making sense that's that's what my goal is just to make this stuff you learn it so make this stuff understandable for you hopefully I'm doing that you're understanding exactly why we're doing a logarithm on both sides because we're solving for an exponent that's only thing it does it hopefully you understand why the Ln makes it nice here why is it better here than here well because we inherently match our base and that's that's nice that's a composition of inverse functions they have to cancel so uh barring the last example of about some effective rate or effective annual yield hopefully this has made sense to you and I'll see you for for a couple more examples in a second all right last little bit we're going to talk about effective rate or um annual yield effective annual yield and so what what that means is the amount of Interest you're actually earning if you were to consider this as simple interest now why would we ever do that well because of how compounding works you actually make or owe more interest than the nominal rate suggests explain that a little bit differently if you were getting a 12% interest rate monthly well you'd get 1% a month that's true but after the first month you actually earn money right so the second month where you're still earning 1% you're not earning 1% on the original amount you're earning % on the original amount plus a little bit so you're earning more than the first 1% so that's weird but the first month you're earning one 1% if it's 12% per year on your amount the second month you're earning 1% still but it's on a larger amount and that happens for the third month fourth month fifth month all the way to 12th month you're earning 1% that's true but it's on a larger amount because compound interest is growing exponentially so this will give you the rate that you're actually earning over one year's time if you were to consider it as simple interest simple interest just says okay take your amount of money look at the amount of time and give yourself that percentage of that value and it's always annual so this is based on one year's time now these formulas look really really familiar but what is the minus one doing why isn't there a p like where does it come from this is a stripped down version of compound interest and compounding continuous interest so here here's what I me I strip down there is no present value or consider the present value to be $1 this is for one year's time so there's no t or consider the time to be one why because if we're only worried about finding the actual annual percentage rate that we are earning the effective APR then what this is going to say is I really don't care about year two I just want to figure out every year how much I'm really earning here or or or paying in interest that would do it consider a dollar consider one year's time this would give you a percentage plus a dollar so subtract the dollar that you invested that's where the minus comes in if you invest the dollar that's one and you figure out how much you'd have after one year and then you subtract the dollar what you're left with because our our our dollars are base 10 and because that pennies represents a percentage uh well that that will leave you with your decimal equivalent of percent that you're actually earning that's what's going on here same thing happens here this says imagine $1 for compound imagine one year well how much would you earn a dollar and some change subtract the dollar what are you left with the change but because that's based on 100 our pennies are cents or part of 100 it's giving you the the decimal equivalent for the percentage of the rate that we actually earned so we're going to do an example right now we'll do it both with traditional interest and with continuously compounded let's find the effective rate of 9 99.75% compounded monthly this the only two piece of information you know it's always over one year so RT is one we don't even write it uh it's always for $1 RP is one we don't even write it and we subtract the one signifying that we're just getting the cents back which represents the percent so let's let's go through it uh because it says compounded monthly we're going to use our traditional compound interest we're going to say here's really what's going on okay you're investing a dollar at 9 and 3/4% you have monthly compounded interest and you're letting this go for a year now we don't show that because it's always a dollar we don't show that because it's always a year but can you can you see it I hope that you can see that this is just your standard formula now where the minus one comes in if we did this without subtracting the one we can do it right now if we did it without subtracting the one we're going to get 1 point something well that one point something would be your future value of your investment of $1 If I subtract the $1 it's going to give me my interest that's true but this interest is only after one year it's only with one so what the interest is going to be is the actual rate of investing $1 so we subtract the one to find the interest we talked about this earlier and that's why I preface it I said if you want to find out your interest take your future value subtract your present value or take your amount subtract your principle it'll leave you with your interest and so this would be the interest that we get I got 1.102 and then minus one so so this is what this is this would be how much you would earn if you put $1 in the bank at 99.75% compound monthly and Let It Go for exactly one year you would have $110 and a little bit more so that 10.2 cents so $112 that's how much you would have if I subtract the $1 I invested take your future value minus your present value I subtract that $1 then I'm going to get 0.102 that is my interest but because it's based on this $1 investment over one year that's also my rate so this is my effective rate 10.2 and you can be a little B more accurate with the decimals I just rounded here quickly 10.2% here's what that means if you invest any sort of money at 99.75% compounded monthly then what you're really earning over one year from the minute the you invest your money to the amount that you're getting out every year you'll actually earn 10.2% on that from start to finish yes you're earning 99.75% but compound and monthly makes it go quicker makes it climb quicker that's what that's saying that's why it's called the effective rate and it's going to be different than your nominal rate uh for continuously compounded it's the same basic idea formul is a little easier we fill this out make sure you got parentheses around that because you don't want to plug this in and say second Ln it's going to give you parentheses you don't want to put the minus one there so close those parentheses then subtract one and we get 0124 that's 10.24% and that right there will show you the difference between compounded a finite number like monthly in this case and compounding continuously you will earn more interest with continuously compounded so we've seen that several times I hope I've made Finance make a little bit more sense to you um of course we're not doing an exhaustive finance class here I just wanted to model some of the finance that's um that's Rel that relates to our exponentials so you can see that so you can see oh yes that's based on E that is exponential growth with a base that's greater than one so is so is are what this is based on that the original compound interest formula that's based on a base that's greated in one we should have some growth on that I hope you saw that hope you saw the necessity for logarithms and when we solved for our exponentials notice we can always solve for the number of compounds although you you rarely see that uh we can solve for time we can solve for present value and we can solve for rate if you need to solve for a rate uh we can do that we can solve for future value so all of these things are open to us at this point but for the solving for time you have to use a logarithm that's only one that you need for so I hope it made sense and next time we'll talk about something very similar actually we'll talk about exponential growth and decay it'll start talking about something called differential equations a very basic introduction to that so I'll see you for another video
