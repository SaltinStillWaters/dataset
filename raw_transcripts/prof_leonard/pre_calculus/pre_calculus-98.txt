Transcript for: Introduction to Sum and Difference Formulas in Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 25)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about sum and difference formulas and man they look crazy but they're really useful so a lot of times when we get angles that that we want to find an exact solution for and it's not our unit circle this can help us also it helps with some identities dealing some stuff in calculus where we might have a couple different angles that we want to put together or separate so we get some different expressions so we're going to take a look at what these formulas are most importantly how we use them so when we take a look at sum and difference formulas basically what that means is if you have a trig function with two angles that are added or subtracted we can typically break those up if they are sine cosine or tangent of whatever two angles we're adding or subtracting now where they come from where these come from is basically a distance formula on part of the unit circle and tangent comes from comparing these so tangent of alpha plus beta is how we call those two angles alpha and beta would say do you remember that tangent can be represented as sine over cosine so it really would take sine of alpha plus beta divided by cosine alpha plus beta and really just simplify that so where these come from our distance formula and comparing sine to cosine i'm not going to go through and prove where they're from what i am going to do is take some of the the ideas that we have for um phase shift of sine compared to cosine and prove it with some of the these identities mostly i'm going to show you how to deal with stuff like this so if we have like sine of 105 degrees and they want an exact solution how in the world do you do that because that's not on your unit circle you 105 degrees isn't there so here's something we can do if we look here if we can represent that angle as either a sum or a difference of two angles that are on your unit circle well then we can break it up instead of looking at the sum we can look at sine of the first part of the angle times cosine of the second part so alpha and beta is what we call those so this would be alpha that would be beta plus cosine of alpha times sine of beta and if we can do that then we can find an exact representation kind of as a work around instead of looking right at 105 degrees so let's think of 105 degrees can you think of two angles that add up or subtract to 105 degrees both of which are on your unit circle you might have a couple solutions but the easiest one in my mind is 60 degrees and 45 degrees that would add to 105 degrees but both 60 and 45 are on your unit circle why is it valuable as soon as we represent 105 degrees in terms of 60 degrees plus 45 we can now use this formula that's what the sum and difference formulas can be used for so sine of alpha plus beta now is sine of 60 degrees plus 45 degrees just take a look at how the formula works for just a second it says take a look at your first angle you're going to take sine of your first angle cosine of your second angle you're going to multiply those let's do that now that would be sine of 60 degrees times cosine of 45 degrees we're just using this is alpha and that is beta so first one second one sine of the first one cosine of the second one let's write that there's a little bit more to it isn't there it says if we have a sine of alpha plus beta we have sine alpha cosine beta plus cosine alpha sine beta so that would be cosine of 60 degrees or the first angle times sine of 45 degrees or the second angle now let's double check it but that's going to be really nice so we looked at this and said 105 degrees no it's not our unit circle if you want exact solution you have to break it up in some way well we notice that 60 degrees and 45 are both on our unit circle and they add to 105 so we can represent 105 as 60 plus 45. so when we do that then we take a look at what one of those sum or difference formulas works we have sine we're looking at sine we have alpha plus beta or 60 plus 45 degrees that's this one sine of the first cosine second plus cosine first sine second sine of the first cosine second plus cosine first sine second when you take a look at sine and cosine sine always has the same sign so plus plus minus minus cosine always has opposite plus minus minus plus cosines are this are both cosine in the first term both sine and the second sine has sines and cosines in the first and the second for both of those so it's a it's a little bit it's nice to memorize that a little bit that your signs are the same for sine opposite for cosine i always think about it sine sines are the same cosine oh that's doesn't have the word sine in it for my brain that makes sense you have different signs up there we'll get to tangent in just a minute now that all those are in a circle we can spend some time to just look that up so sine of 60 degrees if you remember sine of 60 degrees that's the same thing as pi over 3. we're going to get square root 3 over 2. really helps to have your unit circle handy in this it's a good thing i do cosine 45 degrees says here's 45 degrees same thing as pi over 4 cosine square root 2 over 2. cosine 60 degrees well that's pi over three so you're going to be looking at the same angles in a couple places aren't you so we have sine of 60 cosine 60 we have cosine of 45 we're going to have sine of 45. so you're just taking the y and x coordinates depending on whether you're talking about sine or cosine you're going to be using both of them so we've said sine of 60 pi over 3 that's root 3 over 2. cosine 45 we go okay that's square root 2 over 2 the x coordinate cosine 60 here's 60 pi over 3 again that's going to be one half and then sine of 45 is square root 2 over 2 again right there if we spend the time to simplify that that's going to be the square root of 6 over 4 that's the square root 2 over 4. so we get square root 6 plus square root 2 all over 4 because of that common denominator that's it that is the exact representation of what that is so the y-coordinate that's weird but the y-coordinate of the point where 105 degrees is on your unit circle would be square root 2 plus or square root of 6 plus square root 2 all over 4. that's what they're talking about when they're asking for an exact solution that's how to find it use some sum or difference to represent the angle that you cannot find our unit circle just make sure what you're using those two angles that are added or subtracted that those are both on your unit circle didn't really help if you go 105 degrees is 100 degrees plus 5 degrees what sine of 100 degrees i don't know that didn't really help a lot right because we want to be able to look those up to find an exact representation like we just did well with sine of pi over 12 pi over 12 is not on our unit circle we're going to have to come up with something either a sum that adds to pi over 12 or a difference that gives you pi over 12. now i'm not thinking of two angles that add up to pi over 12 really nicely under unit circle because well that that denominator is already pretty large and my numerator is pretty small and so i'm not thinking of two fractions that add up to that very nicely what i can think of is a couple fractions subtract to give us pi over 12 like 4 pi over 12 minus 3 pi over 12. why those ones well if we think about 4 pi over 12 minus 3 pi over 12 4 pi over 12 will simplify to pi over 3 and 3 pi over 12 is simplified to pi over 4. both of those are on our unit circle now that might take some thought you might be like i can't do that right away no maybe not but with some practice and with understanding that what we're looking for are angles on the unit circle that you you want to you want to represent this as it'll come if you if your angle is already fairly small you're probably looking for a difference if your angle is fairly large like 105 degrees you're probably looking for some that's that's always the case but that's a good place to start so i'm thinking hey that's pretty small pi over 12 is really a fairly small angle i'm probably looking for subtraction let's think i want to keep my denominator the same to make it easy 4 pi over 12 that would simplify 3 pi over 12 to simplify okay 4 pi over 12 minus 3 pi over 12 would give us pi over 12. we're going to do that so notice that is still 4 that is still pi over 12. 4 pi over 12 minus 3 by 2 so pi over 12 but when we simplify that that's going to give us pi over 3. that's going to give us pi over 4. occasionally i'll have students who ask why don't you just subtract those and get something simpler you could but it would be that and then you'd be stuck again so we're purposely unsimplifying so that we can find a couple angles that are on our unit circle now that we have look for the appropriate formula so we couldn't find that one we said let's think about separating this as a sum or a difference a difference works really nicely and still has some angles on our unit circle so we're looking at sine we're not a sum right now we're a difference so this is the difference of two angles alpha and beta first and second inside of the sine function so we're going to use that that says sine of the first minus the second well okay that's going to give us sine of the first times cosine of the second for sine of alpha cosine beta minus cosine of the first sine of the second i always think first and second that way it's a little bit easier for me to put this in perspective because that's not really an alpha it's pi over three that's not really a beta that's pi over four so just thinking that through helps me a little bit so i'm going to write that out so sine of the first angle pi over 3 all of our sum and difference formulas for sine have both sine and cosine in both terms cosine is cosines first sines second sine of our our sum and difference has sine cosine sine and cosine in both of them so i'm going to do sine of first cosine second sine also has the same signs so plus plus and we're going to have minus minus so sine of the first cosine second now we're going to do cosine of the first sine of the second we also really want to check our work we're going to double check this on the formula every single time so i want to make sure that i'm doing it right we'd have sine of the first angle i've got that cosine of the second angle i've got that minus i've got a minus sign it matches signs there cosine of the first angle i've got that pi over 3 sine of the second angle i've got that pi over 4. now i'm going to take my unit circle and find those so when we find sine of pi over 3 it's actually the same thing as 60 degrees so that's going to be square root 3 over 2. cosine pi over 4 is the same thing as 45 degrees that's square root 2 over 2 minus cosine of pi over three that's the same thing as 60 degrees so that's going to be one half and sine of pi over four is square root two over two we should be getting pretty good at either memorizing or having the unit circle really handy so we can find those on there most of them when we're using this are simple angles because that's how we're intending to be if you can't find that one make it easy so that you can this is going to give us square root 6 minus square root 2 over 4. and as much as we want to simplify that we can't we don't have like radicals you can't simplify the numerator or denominator you're done that's as as good as you can get on that so we're going to move on just a little bit and we're going to talk about cosine of 165 degrees 165 degrees that's a pretty big angle how in the world could we represent 165 degrees has two angles what we'll think about that that's that's a large angle can you think about some angles that are on the unit circle that add up to 165 degrees a lot of times we're looking for angles like 45 or 135 if we have numbers ending five so automatically i'm i'm thinking either 135 or i'm thinking 45 so 165 and 40 if i've taken away 45 that would give me like 120 120 is also when i get a circle so if i write this as 120 plus 45 that would be two angles on my unit circle that add up to that one that's going to be much better than trying to mess around 165 degrees i would write this as a sum of two angles oftentimes it will be asked it doesn't matter doesn't matter the order in which you have that could you do 45 plus 120. it really doesn't matter um because of the way the formulas work it doesn't doesn't really matter what order you have that in i like the bigger angle first i don't know why just how it works in my head what you don't want to do you don't want to say well 135 is on my unit circle 135 degrees on my inner circle so why can't i deal 135 degrees plus like 30 degrees you can you can do both of them it's just fine to do that if they're all on your unit circle so now that we have this represented as a sum we're going to take a look at the appropriate summer difference formula this is cosine we're looking at cosine we're saying hey i have a sum here 120 plus 45 is just like that alpha plus beta how cosines work cosine sum of difference formulas has all cosines in the first term all signs in the second basically cosine first cosine second switch your signs sine first sine second so that's what we're looking at cosine of the first cosine of the second cosines always pair your cosines and pair your signs sine and sum and difference formulas also have a different sign so if that's plus there's going to be minus there and then we pair our signs up so our s-i-n-e functions the sine functions 120 and 45. thankfully those are all on our unit circle so we're going to take a look and go okay cosine of 120 degrees well that is past 90 degrees that's that's in your that's your second quadrant so cosine's going to end up being negative and that's going to be negative one-half cosine 45 degrees is square root 2 over 2. minus if you take a look at sine of 120 remember you're going to be looking at the same angle twice you should be taking the x coordinate or the y coordinate so for sine of 120 we're going to take not negative one half but square root three over two times sine of 45 is square root 2 over 2. and yeah i'm kind of expecting that at this point we're pretty good at using our own unit circle i know i pulled mine up the first time just to make sure you understand where i'm looking especially for our degrees because we hadn't really done that very often but at this point i'm expecting you can look at this and go cosine 120 yeah i'm able to find negative one half and for sine of four cosine 45 degrees i'm able to find square root 2 over 2. for sine of 120 degrees i know it's positive square root of 3 over 2 and for sine of 45 i know it's positive square root 2 over 2. so when we simplify this we'll get negative square root 2 or 4 minus square root 6 over 4. i promise they're not all square roots 6's and square root 2's and 4's it just happens what i gave you here that's about as good as we can get that would be the exact representation of what that is this is weird but here's an angle cosine of that angle is an x coordinate on your unit circle for that angle this is the x-coordinate on the unit circle for that angle the exact x-coordinate not a representation of it not an approximation of it the exact x-coordinate for that and that's really what this stuff means so i hope i've made it made sense so far we're going to come back with a few more examples okay i just couldn't leave alone i wanted to show this to you so latin in this example just a minute ago we had 165 degrees and i said you know what pops in my head is 120 and 45. maybe you didn't think that maybe you thought 135 and 30 it's just fine it'll work out just fine there's not one particular way to do this as long as you're using two angles that are on your unit circle that add up or subtract two whatever that is it'll work out just fine take a look at it here's 135 plus 30. that is 165 using the same exact formula cosine first cosine second minus sine first sine second that's exactly what we're doing here cosine of 135 degrees that's in the second quadrant that right there is going to be negative square root 2 over 2. the x coordinate is negative in the second quadrant you're going to get square negative square root 2 over 2. cosine 30 degrees well that's square root 3 over 2 minus sine 135 degrees in quadrant 2 sine is positive still that's where 135 degrees is the y coordinate is positive that's square root 2 over 2 but positive times sine 30 degrees that is one half can you see that you're going to get exactly the same thing that's negative square root 6 over 4 that's minus square root 2 over 4. here's the minus here's a negative they're just switched around it's going to give you exactly the same solution so i hope that makes sense it doesn't really matter what you pick as long as it's on the unit circle and adds or subtracts to your value then use the appropriate formula and it'll work out just fine we're going to come back with a couple more examples let's take a look at tangent now so we have tangent of 19 pi over 12 has obviously not our unit circle uh 19 pi over 12 is pretty well it's it's larger than then we really are used to seeing right we we have at least more than more than pi radians there it's not not more than two pi radians but it's a fairly large angle most of the time not all the time most time that happens try to make this a sum of two angles so when we have 19 pi over 12 i'm thinking that's pretty big it's not less than or like our smallest exact angle like pi over six so i'm probably gonna be trying to add to that so i obviously want a denominator of 12 but i want two numbers that simplify that that's the key right because we want to get stuff that's on our unit circle if we have a denominator of 12 pick things like fours and nines and things like that so that you can actually simplify with that that 12. i'm thinking man let's see what would be a good one well or three so 12 is a lot of different different factors to it so maybe 3 and 16 sounds like it would work because that would give me something over over 12 that would simplify there could be several choices we saw in the last example so i'm thinking 16 pi over 12 plus 3 pi over 12. both of those will simplify to something on my unit circle you might have to play around with a couple of them so we have 16 pi over 12 plus 3 pi over 12 it's still 19 pi over 12 but it's written as a sum of two different angles let's simplify those angles i chose them in such a way that it would simplify so that would give us something on the unit circle so 4 goes into both 16 and 12 goes in four times over three times it's 4 pi over 3. and three pi over twelve simplifies to pi over four if you saw something different it's not a problem honestly it's not a problem you could have done let's see 10 pi over 12 and got 5 pi over 6 and 9 pi over 12 and got 3 pi over 4. that's perfectly acceptable you can totally do that this is just the first one that came in my head i don't know why that one it just did so 4 pi over 3 and pi over 4. now we're going to take a look at the appropriate sum or difference so tangent of two angles being added that's where we're at right now let's take a look at how it works it says we want to take tangent of the first plus tangent of the second over one minus tangent of both of them notice the signs here same sign on the top on the numerator different sign on the denominator same sign on the top of the numerator different sign on the denominator for tangents keep that in mind so we'll have tangent first plus tangent second over one minus tangent of both of them that's how i think about it tangent first plus tangent second over one minus tangent of them both all that's left to do now is take out the unit circle take out your table whatever you want to do and figure out the exact representations of those because those are all on our unit circle we haven't done tangent in a while so when we take a look at tangent of four pi over three four pi over three is right there tangent takes y over x negative divided by negative is going to give you a positive we know the tangent is positive in quadrant three square root three over two divided by one half negatives cancel there we end up getting square root of three that is square root of three tangent of pi over four that's quadrant one y over x is going to give us one 1 minus now we multiply both of them so we already have it though notice that we've already got it we know what that is that's the square root of 3 because we already looked it up so that's kind of nice about this that's the same and that's the same that's just the square root of three times one that's honestly as good as we can get we can write this as one plus square root of three over one minus square root of three if you want to do that it doesn't really super matter sometimes you'll see teachers or a few textbooks rationalize the denominator here that is appropriate you can do that how to do that if you don't remember it how to do that is to multiply by the conjugate of the denominator it takes a little bit of work here what the conjugate is is two terms with a different sign in the middle so one plus square root of three the conjugate is one minus square root of three and vice versa this is one of those times when you get that answer and you look in the back of your textbook and it's different and completely different you go got it wrong you might not have got it wrong it's just that they don't like to see square roots on the bottom of your fraction and how to get rid of that is rationalizing so multiply by the conjugate you have to distribute the numerator so what we would get is square root three square root of three times square root three is just three one times one is one plus square root 3. we just distribute the numerator square root of 3 square root of 3 times square root of 3 is 3. 1 times 1 is 1 1 times square root 3 is 1 square root of 3. the denominator is it works just like a difference of squares so the way that that is nice for us is when you distribute one times one is one sure but you're going to get square root three minus square root of three that always cancels with conjugates your middle terms will not annihilate one another so one minus just three square root three times square root of three is three negative square root of three times uh positive square root of three is negative three when we simplify all that we'll have four two square root of three over negative 2. lastly most of the time we don't like to see negatives on the denominator so we'll take the negative and distribute it through the numerator lastly lastly hopefully you see it you can actually simplify this you could do it here you could do it here you can factor out two or understand that you can divide every term in a fraction by the same number and end up getting negative two minus square root three now naturally that looks absolutely nothing like that does it's because we rationalized it but that would be a whole lot easier to work with so hopefully that makes sense to you we took a look at this and said that's a larger fraction let's make sure it's addition we use a sum formula for tangent and then simplify what we get out of that make sure you rationalize if you get a square root on the denominator we're going to get something very similar with tangent of 15 degrees but i really want you to think about this think about 15 degrees 15 degrees is smaller than the smallest angle that's on our unit circle that would be 30 degrees so we're probably not going to add a ticket to 15 degrees we're probably going to take two larger angles and subtract them to get to 15 degrees namely i'm thinking 60 and 45 because if i think 60 minus 45 it will give me 15 degrees so i'm going to write that out i'm going to think of tangent 15 degrees as 60 minus 45 to give us two angles on the unit circle that we already know and can work with and that match up with our formula of tangent of two angles being subtracted now let's see if we can do this by understanding the sine manipulations of tangent here's what tangent does tangent takes your two angles being subtracted takes both of them on the top being subtracted tangent of the first minus tangent second remember same sign for tangent on the numerator different sign on the denominator one plus both of them being multiplied that's precisely what this says right here so when we take a look at that we're going to get tangent first minus second so alpha minus beta tangent of the first minus tangent second one plus tangent of both of them notice the signs same side numerator different sign denominators same sign numerator different sign denominator both of them tangent first tangent second both of them tangent first tangent second we just subtract on the top we add on the bottom if we have two angles being subtracted or tangent so i'm going to take tangent of the first angle at 60 degrees i know that for tangent on the numerator my sign is the same and i need tangent of both of those angles on my denominator i have a different sign so plus on the bottom for this subtraction and then we just again we take tangent of both of those angles but now we're multiplying them so we take our unit circle back out and i suppose i should have enough because we don't really deal with degrees very often so tangent of 60 degrees that's gonna give us y over x or the square root of three square root three over two over one-half two's are going to cancel you're gonna get the square root of three tangent of forty-five degrees so that's pi over four that's one on our denominator we have one plus but then we're gonna have the same thing it's really nice the way this formula works because you already have those written down tangent of 60 degrees is square root of three over two tangent of 45 degrees is one sorry i meant just square root of three just love saying square root of three over two scrolls off the top so that's square root of three that's one we just end up multiplying so we're going to double check that's square root of 3 great minus that's 1. cool 1 plus we already have that that was the square root of 3 times we already have that that was 1. you'd also have to rationalize this notice something your conjugate is based on your denominator so over there the conjugate is 1 plus the square root of 3 because that's the opposite sign of your denominator pair of terms here you would use 1 minus square root 3. that's going to be the conjugate of your denominator and we do exactly the same thing you do need to multiply both the numerator and denominator by exactly the same thing to multiply by this fancy one so as to not change the value of that but when you distribute you get 1 minus 3 minus 1 plus square root 3. square root of three times one square root of three minus three minus one and then plus negative times negative positive plus square root three on our denominator we're going to get one minus square root of three plus square root of three that's zero and then minus three something really similar happens it's just that we have a negative four plus two square root of 3 over negative 2. you can simplify right now if you want to divide everything by negative 2 you totally can you can factor out 2 or negative 2 and simplify whatever you really want to do if i take both of these terms and divide by negative 2 we'll get positive 2 minus positive over negative is negative negative positive 2 minus square root 3. now think about what that means what that is is the ratio of the y-coordinate to the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle at that degree measurement so if you go to 15 degrees right there the y compared to the x will be exactly that value that's what this is doing it's just that you can't find it on a unit circle and get an exact value most calculators won't do it either so we need some sort of a workaround that's where those formulas come in really handy so what we're going to do now i'm going to give you one more example like this then we'll start working backwards i'll give you some stuff like that and say hey does that fit one of these 7 difference formulas that we can simplify kind of in reverse right last one before we go backwards and then make it a little bit more difficult do some some more challenging math so secant of negative pi over 12 a lot of students get stumped on this for two reasons number one well there's a negative angle and number two secant is not up there so there's two things that we need to to realize in order to get this right number one is that while you can figure out two angles that add or subtract to give you a negative often times if you have an even or odd function it might be easier to deal with that first so because secant is an even even function if i plug in opposite angles i get out equal results so that that exists that secant of negative pi over 12 and secant of positive pi over 12 give me the same thing because it's even i can just treat the inside of that that function that argument as positive pi over 12. even functions let you do that so because secant is even i can say just change the sign of your angle and you will not get a different result opposite inputs give you equal outputs for even functions and secant is an even function now i'm taking a look at that and going okay secant of pi over 12 pi over 12 we dealt with already pi over 12 is a fairly small angle it's smaller than our lowest thing which is pi over 6 on the unit circle that has an exact representation exact answer on it so if it's smaller than that i'm probably going to be subtracting angles to get it so i'm not looking at two angles that add to pi over 12 those would both be smaller than pi over 12 and also not on the unit circle pi over 12 is below pi over 6. that's smaller than the smallest angle there so if that's if it's true i'm thinking i'm going to subtract here what can i subtract 4 pi over 12 minus 3 pi over 12. that would give us at pi over 12 and we've seen that already so we've taken a look said uh negative angles use evenness or oddness for your trig function that's even you can change the sign you're just fine it even rhymes now that's a smaller angle that's less than pi over six the smallest angle that for which we have an exact representation i'm going to be subtracting so i represent that this is still pi over 12 but it's simplifiable this would give us pi over three that would give us pi over four now this is where some students get stuck they go great but that's not up there so what in the world do i do instead of inventing a whole new formula for a sum or a difference of secant realize that secant and cosine are strongly related in fact they're reciprocals so here's what we're going to do if we find cosine of pi over 3 minus pi over 4 we work it all the way down then secant of that will be the reciprocal so we're going to take a look at cosine instead yeah i know that's not the same but they're reciprocals of one another so i'm going to find this one work it all the way down reciprocate and it'll be the answer that why you need to remember that secant and cosine are reciprocals of one another secant is a reciprocal function for cosine so cosine of an angle gives you something secant of that same angle gives you the reciprocal of that something so if cosine of theta equal one-half secant of that angle gives you 2 and that's exactly how cosine's even related so when we find this we just reciprocate we get secant for free now let's take a look at what that does for us since we've already worked this down to two angles being subtracted inside a cosine that's going to be that function so cosine works this way it has cosines of both angles opposite of your sine and then sine of both angles that's how i remember it so i'm going to take cosine of both angles it does not matter the order because multiplication is commutative it does matter the order uh when you get to subtracting like you can't sometimes you can't reverse these and get the same thing so be careful with that um order of like this like you can't reverse the one and the tangent is being multiplied but these two angles you you can doesn't really matter so cosine i know cosines are paired up i'm going to have a different sign so minus yields a plus for my formula and then sines are together sine of both angles and we're going to double check always double check that so i've got cosine pi over 3 minus pi over 4 so cosine of first cosine second got that different side so for a minus i'm gonna get a plus in my formula got that then sine first sine second sine first sine second it looks really good now we take our unit circle out wherever you may have that and we figured this out so cosine of pi over three that's going to be one half times cosine pi over four is square root two over two plus sine of pi over 3 is square root 3 over 2 and sine of pi over 4 is square root 2 over 2. when we simplify all that we get the square root of two plus the square root of six all over four because we have square root two over four we can square six over four comma denominator let's just put that on one fraction now that is precisely what the x coordinate of this angle that pi over 12 would be on the unit circle so if you went to pi over 12 your x coordinate would be square root two plus square root of six all over four that's not what we're looking for we're looking for secant so here's what secant would do if cosine pi over 3 minus pi over 4 is this thing then secant of pi over 3 minus pi over 4 is the reciprocal of this don't reciprocate these reciprocate this cosine gives you one thing secant will be the reciprocal of that now it would be great if we were just done but do you see what has to happen you got four over since jungle square roots in it and they don't like jungle square roots in it so you're probably going to rationalize this is correct right this is numerically just fine but you're probably not going to see that and so rationalizing takes your denominator and multiplies by the conjugate of that which means that you're gonna multiply by two square root two minus square root of six and if we do that it's just a matter of distributing and simplifying so 4 square root 2 minus 4 square root 6. which you cannot combine by the way those do not have like radicals your denominator should remove all square roots completely that's going to be square root 2 times square root 2 is 2. square root of 6 times square root 6 is 6. the middle terms are going to cancel so we have 2 minus group 12 plus root 12 that's that's done and then minus 6 so 2 minus 6. we are almost done hopefully you see this as well you can factor out a 4 or a negative 4 or just divide every term by negative 4 which is what i'm going to do so 4 divided by negative 4 is negative 1 square root 2 negative 4 divided by 84 is positive 1 square root of six and of course you can make it a little bit nicer by putting square root six minus square root two it doesn't really matter what does matter is that you get down that far because that is actually a lot easier to work with than that with some square roots on the denominator i hope i've made it very clear on how you can take some angles that are not on unit circle and manipulate them to the point where you can use these formulas to figure out exact representations of those angles when you can't even look up the angles themselves so that's pretty nice that's one use of this we're going to do now is we're going to come back and we're going to take a look at what would happen going in reverse we're going to take a look at just a few more examples on how you can use these formulas directly so namely how to go backwards really because it gets you used to some identities how to use these things in reverse it's really important because they are identities that means they're not just one-way streets they go both ways here so we should be able to say hey if it fits this you can make it even simpler and that's what this does so here's the point if these fit this side perfectly you can go the other way so how we do this we really take a look at the structure of it if you have sine and cosine together minus another cosine sine together you're talking about either a sum or a difference for sine somewhere or difference for your sum of difference formulas for for your sign that's that's right here so when we take a look at that we go all right well which one does it fit does it fit any of them so i'm taking a look at the sine of 20 degrees cosine 80 degrees minus cosine 20 degrees sine of 80 degrees i'm noticing that the two different functions in both terms sine cosine cosine sine i'm noticing the minus that's pointing me right here so there's a minus there's sine cosine there's cosine sine what's that tell us if we have the same angle here and the same angle here sine and cosine cosine sine and we switch the angle between them and we have a subtraction here's what we can do we can take whatever this angle is and subtract it into sine we can go that way so this would be the same thing as sine of 20 degrees minus 80 degrees but it has to be in that order that's really important what i mean by that is you can't take this and do sine of 80 degrees minus 20 degrees the subtraction is not commutative so the order that this is where you have 20 80 20 80 that is your first angle and that is your second angle it has to start here that is your first angle that is your second angle it has to be subtracted in that order so 20 minus 80 not 80 minus 20. sine of negative 60 degrees you know you really could do that you could take out your unit circle go negative 60 degrees and find the y coordinate you'd be just fine but you know me i'm going to make you use identities so what about sine of negative 60 degrees if sine is an odd function that means that opposite inputs have opposite outputs that's what odd means for functions so sine of negative 60 is the same thing as negative sine of positive 60. remember with odds if we change the inside side we change the function's sign and sometimes that's very very valuable so negative sine of 60 degrees well let's see sine of 60 degrees that's like pi over 3. that's going to be a y coordinate in quadrant one of square root three over two we just have a negative out front giving us negative square root of three over two so the negative here is that negative this piece is square root of three over two and that's it that's exactly what this would be representing is that negative square root of three over two let's move on to tangent so tangent of forty degrees minus tangent to ten degrees all over one plus tangent forty tangent 10. that looks really like one of these two tangent formulas why because it has a whole bunch of tangents in it let's just figure out which one all we've got to do is look for the signs so our signs say we're dealing with a minus and a plus here's a minus and a plus we're going to be using the the difference formula for tangent so minus plus here's our first angle here's our second we have to subtract them in that order so tangent of your first angle tangent of 40 degrees 40 degrees has to be the first thing that you you do when you have tangent of that argument it's going to be 40 minus the second so 40 minus 10 not 10 minus 40. so tangent of first minus tangent of second that is the first minus the second so we know the signs are the same for tangent minus and minus minus and minus now tangent of 30 degrees that's not too bad you can use your table use your your unit circle memorize it however you can tangent of 30 degrees 30 degrees is pi over 6 so we would take the y coordinate one half divided by the x coordinate square root 3 over 2. the twos are going to cancel we get 1 over the square root of 3 or if you rationalize the square root 3 over 3. that's pretty much as good as we can do i hope to explain it well enough for you to be able to see that we can go both ways on these formulas it's really important and useful to be able to do that okay last one i'm hoping that you can look at this and look at this and figure out which one of these formulas is represented we've actually just used in that example but you should be pretty familiar with it at this point being a look at it and go well wait a minute all the cosine stuff all the cosine stuff has cosines and sines paired up all the sine stuff has sine and cosine mixed up all the tangent stuff only has tangents in it so when we take a look and see sines and cosines cosines and sines we're dealing with a sum or a difference for sine in this case we go well that's a minus signs have the same sign so minus says i'm going to be dealing with a difference of two angles this is the way that i organize in my head it works for me maybe it'll work for you is that i always categorize these as what what is what do they act like in general signs always have both sine and cosine and both terms and they have the same signs for the sum and for the difference so for us that's going to create a difference also we have the order it's really important that we have sine of the first cosine of the second that must be your first angle that must be your second angle what that means for us is that we would take these these things tell us we're dealing with sign this says it's a difference putting it all together says this can all be represented going backwards at sine of the first angle minus the second that's pi over 12 minus 7 pi over 12. that's negative pi over 6 pi over 12. now you can be thinking odd function right now that's great you could totally change your sign there we can also simplify so 6 pi over 12 is the same thing as pi over 2. so i'm going to do two things right now 6 pi over 12 is pi over 2 and then because sine is an odd function i can say opposite inputs are opposite outputs i can change my sign of my argument and get a sign change for my function itself so that's pi over 2 negative angle gives us negative function for odd functions there pi over two is pretty nice for sine so that's going to be one so this whole thing works down to just negative one that's really all there is to it i hope that this has made sense so far i hope that you really see in the utility and using this it's kind of nice it works really well to be able to deal with some very awkward things so that's really our introduction to how these sum and difference formulas work what's going to happen in the next videos i'm going to come back with some more advanced stuff we're going to talk about uh what would happen dealing with with sum and difference when we have to find our find some angles that aren't even representable on a unit circle and so we're going to do that we'll talk about some proofs some some kind of cool proofs about a um about phase shifting for sines and cosines and lastly we'll talk about inverses so inverses as it as it really works with some of these summon difference formulas that's about it so i hope you've enjoyed the video i hope you've learned something we're going to break this up and come back with some more advanced concepts in just a little while have a great day you
