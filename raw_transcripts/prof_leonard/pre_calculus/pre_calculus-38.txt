Transcript for: Finding Vertical Asymptotes of Rational Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 38)
hi welcome to another video so in this video we're going to start talking about rational functions and they're exciting they're fractions but they're kind of exciting because we get some very cool pictures out of them we can graph them and i'm going to teach you some great techniques on how to graph rational functions as easily as i can make it for you and how we start with that is understanding really what a rational function is that they are fractions and fractions can cause some domain problems when we're talking about functions that polynomials couldn't so here's what rational functions really are rational functions are fraction functions where we have variables on both the numerator and the denominator the denominator is required to have variables on it otherwise you really get a polynomial because you could just divide every term on the numerator by a constant on the denominator and create this polynomial that had fractions as coefficients that's not really what we're talking about we're talking about a polynomial divided by a polynomial that has variables on both the numerator denominator those can cause some really interesting things to happen so when we're talking about these these fraction functions we really need to understand that because we do have variables on the denominator we can get some domain issues now you should remember about domain like when we talked about fractions you oh yeah the denominator can't equal zero and if it does equal zero on the denominator or bottom of a fraction we get some problems what we're going to do is start defining those problems as graph issues you see we get two types of graph issues so what you're going to learn in this video is that when your denominator equals zero we are either going to get a hole in our function graph goes along misses a point exactly one point and continues it actually kind of meets that hole we'll use that we will absolutely use that when we're graphing or we get what's called a vertical asymptote it's like a force field it's like this graph goes along goes oh no and then or off and it can't touch it there's no way for this graph to interact with that vertical asymptote well i won't say interact touch this vertical asymptote and so we get get one of those two ideas so our job is really to discuss when you get a hole and when you get a vertical asymptote the hole only looks one way there's a hole you just kind of miss a point don't miss the point and then vertical asymptote what those things are vertical asymptotes is plural a vertical asymptote that individual is one and you might have several so that's what we say there are can be several vertical asymptotes it's not called a vertical asymptotes don't do that i've heard lots of students say that but asymptote like that is an individual so we're going to talk about the kind of the four ways you can see those i'm not going to give you anything definitive on oh you're always going to get this or this or this which happens to be my four favorite dance moves but uh but we will talk about that you will get those and i'll show you later when we get to sketching and graphing rational functions when those happen so let's get right into it so if fractions cause domain problems and if the denominator of a rational function equals zero and we know that we get those domain problems what those really are called is a discontinuity it's where your graph goes along and then you miss a point or you get this place where you can't continue like a force field like a vertical asymptote those things don't happen in polynomials polynomials are smooth fully continuous curves for the entire domain which is all real numbers so they go forever and ever creating these really smooth curves rational functions can have some some hiccups uh some missing things so if your denominator equals zero if the denominator of a rational function equals zero we do get a domain problem and discontinuity at that value of x the x that makes that denominator zero it has very little to do with the numerator so what do you use the numerator for really x-intercepts the numerator will give you x-intercepts and it will also tell you whether your denominator is a whole or a vertical asymptote so we'll be comparing that now these things these domain issues these values of x they will also cause graph issues we're going to jump right into what those are so if your denominator equals 0 at this x then at x there's going to be one of two types of discontinuities the first is a whole or what's called a removable discontinuity now why they call it removable is that if you define your function with just one additional point you can put that point in there and you can fix the discontinuity that's what's called a removable discontinuity as you get into calculus you might hear that it means nothing more than a hole in your graph so don't let this phrase really confuse you you can call it a whole and everybody's understand what you're talking about um the removable part of it is you can fill the hole with one point that's it so what happens when the factor and so here's what here's when you get these you'll get a hole when the factor that is causing your denominator to equal 0 can be cancelled now what would it be canceled with well it would be cancelled with something on the numerator and you heard me say about a minute ago that the numerator will tell you whether your domain problem is a hole or a vertical asymptote so here's the whole rundown of what we do with these first thing we do is we look at our fraction function our rational function and we factor the whole thing then what we do is we look at our denominator we take those factors that we have um and we set them equal to zero and we discovered that hey all those factors that are equal to zero are going to cause so some domain issues for us the ones that you can cancel stand for holes the ones that you can't stand for vertical asymptotes now here's the deal you can't just cancel them and say i don't have a hole anymore i fixed it you can never fix domain problems it's oh man it sets the world it's kind of like baggage and relationships it never goes away it's always hidden it says it's right there right and sometimes it pops back up you can't get rid of that stuff like it follows you and so that's kind of what a hole does it's going to look like it's gone you're going to cancel it but all that's telling you is that what you just canceled out is a hole in your function it's going to go along like this you're going to go long you're going to be missing a point and then it's going to continue that's what a hole or a removable discontinuity looks like is it continuous no it's not you go like this and you go oh i can't continue on without lifting my pencil off the paper it's not you're not allowed to do do this you go around you that circle's there so you're missing a point so you're going you jump you miss a point that's called a hole uh one thing about this what's very interesting is that in calculus we talk about limits and the limit would actually exist here from left and right it goes to the same value the value itself is not there which is why it's disk it's a discontinuity it's not continuous but the limit actually does exist we get there interesting uh so we're going to use and actually these are really useful because we're going to use these as tight a type of point i know the point's not there but it is something your graph has to interact with so if we can find the location of a hole we know the graph has to sort of touch it not complete it and leave it so we're going to use that we're going to use it kind of like a point so the whole rundown about holes is we factor and you look at your factors on the denominator if you have more than one if you have one fine that's whatever that is we look at them and if you can cancel them then that domain problem is going to be a whole so we factor we find our domain problems and then we define them i'm going to show you how to do that after i talk about a vertical asymptote and what that means so if we can cancel it then what you just defined is a whole and we can find the value of that whole find out where that is so what happens if you can't cancel that factor well vertical and vertical asymptote happens when the factor that's causing your denominator equal to zero it can't be cancelled and here's what they look like they kind of man i like star wars so it kind of reminds me of force field or like a star trek or whatever it's it's like this thing where i always used to picture it now i'm going to really maybe date myself here but like star wars episode 6 when they're going to the death star if you haven't watched it spoiler alert here and there's always one dude that that doesn't pull up in time like they hit the foreshore up make the force of every movie that has force field that happens well this is kind of like a force field so this graph is going to have to pull up before it hits it or go down before it gets it and it cannot cross it why because at that value your denominator would equal zero we know that that is not okay so if your denominator equals zero here you're just frankly missing a point if your denominator equals zero here and you cannot cancel out that factor then what you end up getting is you end up getting this going to infinity sort of idea and that has to do with when you're dividing a number that's uh that's very close to zero you either get positive or negative infinity for instance take like a hundred and divide it by one you're going to get a hundred take a hundred and divided by point one you're going to get a thousand point zero one you're gonna get ten thousand take a hundred and divide by point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one and you're gonna get something that's really really really really big or really really really really negative depending on whether you're divided by a positive or negative number and so that's kind of what happening if this value equals zero on your graph then something just to the left of it and just to the right of it is either going to cause something really close to positive infinity or really close to negative infinity and for that reason i'd kind of just described limits to you here's what happens you're going to get one of four looks your graph is going to look like this or this like this or like that those are the four cases that you're ever going to get with a vertical asymptote and you can have several on one graph here's the main points a whole happens when you have a factor that causes your denominator to be zero and and you can cancel out vertical asymptote happens when the denominator has a factor in it that creates it let me repeat that happens when there's a factor on the denominator that causes your denominator equals zero and you can't cancel it you're gonna have one of four cases here you have all of these things in one graph uh what we're going to be doing here is when we start identifying those factors that cause your denominator to be equal to zero we're going to identify whole or vertical asymptote you're going to have one of four cases where these four cases happen this is kind of interesting man i hope you remember about multiplicity if the multiplicity of the factor that's causing your denominator to equal zero is even you're going to get one of these two looks if it's odd you're going to get one of these two looks so odd multiplicity had a lot to do with whether we're crossing the x axis or even had to do with withered bouncing for vertical asymptote a vertical asymptote or vertical asymptotes the the multiplicity of the factor that's causing your denominator to be equal to zero is going to tell you whether you're doing this odd opposite or even symmetrical sort of a multiplicity you're going to either opposite infinities or the same infinity so these two are going to happen when you have odd multiplicity for your denominator factors odd multiplicity when you have the same sort of symmetry that comes from evenness and this is going to come when you have even multiplicity for your denominator factors that's about it what we're going to do right now is i'm going to give you some examples because this this is not vague i've explained it well on what these things are but it's still sort of sort of out there we haven't made it concrete yet in terms of examples so the long story hopefully made short is you are going to be looking at your denominator you're going to factor you're going to set it equal to zero and you're going to identify that you have several one or several domain issues then what you're going to do you're going to look at the factors that are giving you your domain problems you're going to look to see if that particular factor can be cancelled if it can be canceled then the domain problem you just identified is a whole you cancel the factor out you plug in the value you find the hole and it gives you kind of a type of point you're going to use a graph if you look at the factor and you cannot cancel it then what you've just identified is called a vertical asymptote we put a little dotted line actually force field we absolutely do use our graph to interact with this it's a very strong graphing tool but your graph cannot touch it it causes discontinuities in either case it's just a different type of discontinuity you can have one of four types of vertical asymptotes with odd multiplicity you're either doing this or you're doing this with even you're this or you're doing this and it kind of depends on the sign around it so we're going to be looking at that as we get into sketching i can't tell you right now oh you're always going to get this one with odd it that's not true it really depends on how your signs are interacting around that vertical asymptote the reason why this one goes to infinity and infinity and these two infinities is because when you divide by zero it's undefined you cannot plug in a point and do that but something just to the left and to the right of zero is dividing some number by a number that's very very very very very small dividing any number by a number that's very very very very very small that's going to give you a very large number either positive or negative that's why we get these infinities so let's take a look at some examples and get a feel for uh holes and vertical asymptotes a little bit more clearly all right so we're ready to identify whether or not we're going to have some domain issues and what those domain issues are one thing i want to caution you on is just because you have a rational function these are all rational functions we have a polynomial over a polynomial and a fraction so that means variables on both the numerator and the denominator just because you have that doesn't mean that you have to have domain issues it just means that if you do have domain issues where your denominator equals zero and that's the only type of demand issues that we are going to have and rational functions there's no square roots here no logarithms nothing like that if you're going to have them we can define them furthermore if you know how to define them you can use them to graph so it's kind of nice to have these things and understand what they are because we use them to graph very easily so let's take a look at the first example if you heard what i said in the first part of the video we're basically just going to factor everything both the numerator and the denominator we're going to do that first so we look at f of x we have x plus 3 over x minus 4 that's already totally factored so when i teach you to sketch what i'm going to be doing is telling you we're going to find x intercepts y intercepts vertical asymptotes horizontal asymptotes oblique asymptote if there is one there's either horizontal or oblique and then we're going to find a few points and we're going to be using that to sketch or graph these rational functions right now or just on like the first step so we're going to factor we're going to look at our denominator first and you're going to say hey let's set that set that equal to zero and see what we get out of it so what we do first we factor everything we say okay we're done let's set the denominator equal to zero and you're going to solve that so we're sort of using the zero product property after we factor this already factored so it becomes its own factor we set that equal to zero and then go okay let's solve that would be x equals four then what we do is we we're adding four to both sides then what we do is we look at the factor from where we got that discontinuity this right here says one thing about this function this is if you allow x to equal four you're gonna have a serious problem you're gonna have seven over zero wait a minute can you have zero on the bottom of your fraction no you can't why it's undefined like there's no way to get that it'd be saying you're taking seven real pieces out of something that doesn't exist it's impossible for us to define that scenario it's it's we cannot do it so that is something that's in undefined that's a domain problem so we know on our domain that we would say all right uh domain would be all real numbers except that x can't equal four if it does equal four we have a big problem so from what we know though we're going to look back at that factor and determine whether we can cancel that or not because what that's going to do is say okay yeah you ca kind of weird statement that yeah you can't allow x to equal four so at x equals four what you have one of these two things where you can't allow x to equal four you either have a whole or you have a vertical asymptote in what way can't you let x equal four where you're simply missing a point or whether you have sort of a force field like a vertical asymptote this is where we look back at our factors all right look at x minus four and look at x plus three can you cancel the x minus four if you see another factor of x minus four in the numerator the answer's yes and this would become a whole well we don't see that we look at x minus four you go well the only other factor is x plus three can i cancel x minus four with x 3. no i can't and that right there defines what this is so so again we factor everything got it we look at our denominator and set those factors equal to 0 and we solve them first no matter what you do not cancel first we solve them first this gives us their domain it says hey i can't have these values okay how can't you have them uh well i can't have them because i i can't cancel this that means this is a vertical asymptote so at x equals 4 we have a vertical asymptote more than that we're going to look at the multiplicity of the factor that gives us that vertical asymptote holes don't really have a multiplicity you don't really care that much about them but for vertical asymptote or vertical asymptote vertical asymptotes we do so we look back and go okay that had a multiplicity of one that's odd i don't really care about the value of that that power i care that it is odd here's what that means at x equals four we are going to have either this or that in this one case just because we have a positive out front there's nothing fancy going on we're going to have this case it is certainly going to look like this that's what's going to happen around that x equals 4. we have an odd vertical odd multiplicity vertical asymptote gonna look like one of those specifically this one in general you can't tell unless it's sort of a simple rational function if there was a negative up front we would switch that around so it looks like that and that's pretty much the whole thing so we're going to move on we're going to do a few more of these to get the real feel for how vertical asymptotes interact with our graph and then we'll be good to go so let's look at the next one we're looking at g of x we got negative 2 over x minus 1 to the second power we're going to go through the same process so we're looking to go all right we're going to factor both the numerator and the denominator well the numerator is factored and the denominator is factored i've kind of made these easy because we know how to factor we're going to spend a whole lot of time doing that so we look at that and go okay that's factored the next thing we do is we take our denominator and we set the factors equal to zero i don't need you to set x minus one squared equal to 0 i need to treat this sort of like we treated x-intercepts and go all right what's the real factor the real factor is x minus 1 you just happen to have it twice which is where we get multiplicity it's a repeated asymptote in this case so we're going to set x minus one equal to zero and we're gonna solve it so we get x equals one now here's what that means so we take a look and i go okay what was the purpose in us setting our denominator equal to zero or the factors of the denominator equal to zero we're basically saying that's a problem that's a real problem because if you know this you know that if your denominator equals zero we have some domain issues we just never defined those before you've known this since uh intermediate algebra when you did rational functions usually it's like chapter seven in that that class uh so you do this you go all right uh that's a problem i just know that domain-wise i can't have one now we're saying how we can't have it i know that's a weird statement but it's going to fall into one of two categories either a whole or a vertical asymptote so we look back at this we go right i know that x cannot equal one so at x equals one we have one of two discontinuities that actually needs to make sense to you if you can't let x equals one which is true you cannot have that then at x equals one we have a problem you're defining the problem do you see how we make a little switch there you can't let x equals one for the function and so we have one of two problems at x equals one so then we're going to look and see what we have so we look back at our our factor here we look at our numerator and we see whether we can cancel this factor with anything on the numerator and you go uh yeah no there's there's no factor up there besides two or you can consider it negative two but there's nothing that will allow us to cancel the x minus one so you simply say no i can't cancel it if we cannot cancel the factor then we do not have a whole we have a vertical asymptote so we're gonna write that so we have a vertical asymptote some something like a force field where your graph cannot touch it certainly interacts with it but it cannot touch it now we're going to define a little further look back at the factor from where we got that vertical asymptote okay this came from the factor of x minus one that has a multiplicity of two that's an even vertical asymptote even multiplicity even vertical asymptote so what that says to us is that this vertical asymptote is going to look like this or like this when we graph it it's either going to do that due to the nature of even is typically symmetrical about the why even functions are so this is sort of symmetrical about a type of y a vertical asymptote is a type of y it just sort of shifted over wait a minute do you remember that adding or subtracting inside of a function is a left shift or a right shift that's actually actually a shift of the y equals one over x squared graph shifted to the left one spot and reflected wait what that's a vertical asymptote it looks just like this that's what that is in the next video we're going to graph some of those with transformations it's going to make this stuff really gel together you just need to understand a vertical asymptote before we actually get there which is why we're doing this so this is a vertical asymptote it's going to be even so we're going to have this going to the same sort of infinity either positive or negative i know because i've done the transformations already that that negative makes it go downward so it's going to look just like this around that x equals 1. we're going to have the vertical asymptotes so you might have a question right now um what what are the numerators have to do with anything well the numerators will let you know two things number one if you can cancel that factor it's going to let you know that you had a hole if you can't it's gonna let you know you had a vertical asymptote for this particular x value for which you got a domain problem and you look at the the exponent of your factor from where you got that it also tells your x-intercepts so it is valuable it's just not going to give you any specifics for a vertical asymptote what other than it is one or it's a whole so here your x-intercept would be negative three you set your numerator equal to zero for those here you don't have an x-intercept so negative two can't equal zero so this would say you're not crossing the x-axis ever how could that look is it possible to have this vertical asymptote without touching the x-axis the answer is what this graph really looks like it's about like that now i haven't found the y-axis y-intercept that's gonna be negative 2. uh i haven't found that but that's about what that graph looks like we're going to study that next time okay let's move on a little bit so we're looking at h of x we're saying hey 2x over x squared minus 4. the first thing that we're going to do in graphing or finding any sort of discontinuity is we're going to factor everything so we look at our numerator and go okay that's factored look at our denominator you go all right i can factor that as x minus 2 and x plus 2 due to the fact that it's a difference of squares then what we do is we define our domain you don't start looking to cancel right now you're defining right now so we look at all of our factors on our denominator that have variables so we see x minus two we see x plus two we're going to set both of those equal to zero sorted by the zero product property if you set your whole denominator equal to zero then you can set each factor equal to zero right that's the zero product property we're just sort of shortcutting that we're going all right i'm gonna set all of my factors equal to zero because if any of these factors that have a variable are equal to 0 on my denominator it makes the whole denominator equal to 0. that's why we factor first because it lets us identify this stuff and we're going to keep going and say all right i'm going to add 2 i'm going to subtract 2 and these are my two domain issues these are values that i cannot plug into my function right now if i do i get something divided by 0. i get a real number either 4 or negative 4 divided by 0 in either of these two cases try for yourself if you want to that means that we have domain problems this is an issue so our domain says we cannot let those happen if you want to write your domain that's pretty much it there's other ways to write that but that's pretty much it so yeah i can't let that happen and by the way we've studied interval notation for domain we studied set builder notation for domain so we've done that before this is just saying you can't let these things happen keep that in mind please understand this when you find your domain problems like this these are values that you're not allowing this and this just defines how you're not allowing it are you not allowing it by making it a whole that's if you could cancel them or one or are you defining it by making it a verbal asymptote that's if you can't you get a force field out of it so we're defining now what these domain problems are going to create graphically did how do you see that i hope you see that these values can't happen now we're defining graphically what that looks like so we look back at the factors that gave us these domain issues we look back at x minus two we go oh that had a multiplicity of one what that means is that this factor with the multiplicity one gave us this discontinuities that x can't equal two so we're going to define how that looks at x equals two graphically so at x equals two what type of discontinuity did you have what type of i can't equal this do you have well because it has that's you cannot cancel that factor so i can't cancel x minus 2 i look at the numerator can't cancel it so at x equals 2 and because of our odd multiplicity i have a vertical asymptote with odd multiplicity so i know right now that at x equals two we sort of get this sort of force field where we're going to be interacting with it in one of these two ways the same exact thing is going to happen here so we look at that and say yeah i can't allow x to equal negative two how can't you allow it with a whole or vertical asymptote let me take a look at my factor at x equals negative 2 i got that from x plus 2. that factor cannot be canceled there's no x plus 2 factor in the numerator it also has a multiplicity 1 so this is also a vertical asymptote with odd multiplicity and we're going to do that every single time you get a lot of vertical asymptotes with odd multiplicity just saying that's very very very common if you want to look at your numerator you should right now start to kind of be thinking do i have any x intercepts there and you do actually x 2x would equal zero x equals zero is an x intercept so your y intercept is zero and your x-intercept is also zero here so that's kind of neat now the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to do this one that's the last one we have we're going to see both a hole and a vertical asymptote let's show you where we get the the whole idea from and how to define that missing point all right so let's go for it the first thing we do whenever we get a rational function we're trying to graph it or trying to find the asymptotes or we're trying to find the x-intercepts we basically factor everything we define our our denominator our domain first always first and then we start defining um what that domain means graphically after that we do x-intercepts and the reason why we don't go the other way is because occasionally like here you'd start to find x-intercepts first and then you'd cross them out and go well what happened i crossed that x-intercept no that was actually a hole you just didn't realize it because we did it backwards so we factor everything first on the numerator that means x minus three and x plus three on the denominator that means x plus seven and x minus 3. that's x squared plus 4x minus 21. so here's the here's what to do and what not to do what not to do first don't run off and say oh i have x intercepts at 3 and negative 3. no you don't um here's what also what not to do i'm just going to cancel this to make it easier don't do that define your denominator first this is your baggage even though you can cancel these and you will just be patient even though you can cancel those that baggage stays with this function this says you can't plug in three you ain't never gonna be able to plug in three ever like you could define the function differently and allow one point but you cannot let that three happen ever in the function the way that it's written so trust me we're gonna factor first and then we're gonna define the domain how we do that is to look at the factored denominator and set each of those factors equal to zero pretty much by the zero product property so x plus seven equals zero and x minus three equals zero and that's going to give us two problems or two two discontinuities on this graph so if we subtract seven we get x equals negative seven if we add three to x equals three now keep in mind what that means these are values that are not allowed in this function if you allow x to equal negative seven you're gonna have a value over zero if you allow x equal three you can have zero over zero zero over zero isn't that one no it's not a one it's a problem it's a problem anytime your denominator equals zero so these guys are here they're kind of bad guys like these are things as far as our functions are they can't handle so we have just found our domain x cannot equal negative seven and x cannot equal positive 3. those are not okay those are discontinuities in both cases do this first let your denominator define your domain for you first then we start defining what these discontinuities look like you go okay i know i can't allow x to equal negative seven and i know i can't allow x over three but what's that mean for us like how does that look this is where we go back and we go okay let's take a look at the x equals negative or can't equal negative seven first that came from a factor of x plus seven so we're gonna look at that factor can you cancel out that factor with the numerator no i don't see any x plus seven factors up there so what that's telling us is that because i cannot cancel out this factor that's going to create this thing where i get a number over 0 and i any anything that's really close to that zero so like if i plugged in 7.000001 i'd get a number over something very very very small that's going to give me either a positive or a negative infinity depending on the signs if i plugged in six point uh negative six point nine nine nine nine nine so negative seven point zero zero zero zero one or negative six point nine nine nine in either case i'm going to get like number divided by something super close to zero well what that's going to do is that's going to give me something that's going to positive or negative infinity that's why this thing is a vertical asymptote so this cannot be canceled it says you're going to get something that's that you can divide by really close to zero giving you a infinity sort of concept so all that to say at x equals negative seven we have a vertical asymptote and because the factor has a power one it's an odd odd multiplicity vertical asymptote looks like this or like that so that's we're going to get graphically then we continue go okay we also know that x equals 3 is a problem we already defined our domain you do this first every single time you define your domain first for rational functions then we go right because i can't have that in what way can't i have it do i have a whole or a vertical asymptote i'm going to look back at my factor x equals 3 or x can't equal 3 came from x minus 3 that factors right here so i look back at my function oh look at that i can cancel that factor what that does is that says at x equals 3 you are going to have a hole now here's what to do with that hole a lot of textbooks and and teachers i've seen just say oh you have a hole there great but it's very confusing as to what that hole does is that hole in the x-axis is the whole like where where is that hole you need to find where the hole is you need to find that missing point don't miss that point like you need to do the next step here's what to do and do it in this order factor define your domain define what those domain issues are like we've just done for a vertical asymptote you're defining what type you have either odd or even this or this or the reflective version of those depending on the multiplicity of your factor when you get to a hole cross it out and this will allow you to redefine your function you see the reason why we don't do this first is because a lot of times if you let students cross these out first they miss the fact they have a hole but the fact that this does simplify leaves you with a simpler function now this is quite interesting and this is where students come up with a very common misconception like oh well can't i plug in three here now like if i that doesn't have a domain problem anymore yeah exactly that's what it looks like that's why you define your domain first because here it certainly does look like you can plug in three in fact we're going to but here's what we're gonna do with it this says you can't plug in three you already know that you defined it don't change it this never changes you can't ever make the the domain better you only make it worse so this does not get fixed you can never plug in three but if we allow ourselves to plug in three here listen carefully this will show us exactly where that hole is on our graph the thing that our function must intersect with so it's basically finding a point so if i plug in 3 so allow this to plug in the thing that you can't plug in we would get three plus three is six over ten three plus three is six over three plus seven is ten if we simplify that we get uh what three fifths so divide by two we get three-fifths here's what that means for us there will be a hole at exactly the point three comma three-fifths now we'd use that we'd say all right i'm gonna go to the the value or graphical value if you want the point three comma three fifths so over one two three up like just a little bit and i'd put a hole there i'd say at that value right here you're gonna have a hole so your graph looks something like this it's going to come to that missing point and that's going to continue it's kind of an awkward looking graph but it's very valuable here's the last thing i'm going to say to you and then we're going to end this graph will look exactly like this graph that's hard for students understand this cancelling out it does make this graph look like this graph the only exception between these two is that this will have a missing point right there so this graph looks like this one this graph itself would not have the missing point but because it came from this one we defined our missing point we said okay now what to do with this hole plug it in to get the value of where that hole is it's right there and this graph is going to look just like that one we'd graph them the same exact way hey does that still have a vertical asymptote at x equals negative seven yes it's still odd yes does the house still have an x intercept at three or negative three yes just like that one this does not have an x-intercept positive three that was cancelled out so these graphs will look identical beside the fact that it has a missing point or a hole so i hope that makes sense i hope that you have an idea of when you get vertical asymptotes and when you get holes that's about all i want to do right now we'll continue with different types of asymptotes and talk about graphing a little bit later have a great day
