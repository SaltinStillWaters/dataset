Transcript for: How to Find Inverse Trigonometric Functions (Precalculus - Trigonometry 19)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video what we're going to do is we're going to try to find some inverse trig functions so based on something like that can we find an inverse function i want to first remember just a little bit about what we need in order for this to happen for sine cosine and tangent we had to restrict the domain in order to create a one-to-one piece of this function about which we could find an inverse and so what i want you to remember is that for sine in order for us to find an inverse your domain has to be negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 inclusive where cosine is 0 to pi inclusive and for tangent it's negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 without those endpoints in it we have to make sure that whatever is here falls in whatever's there so there's a few things that i really need you to get number one when you find an inverse the first thing that we're going to do is find the domain and the range why well because for inverse function inputs numbers change domain becomes range and range becomes domain so if we can find our domain and our range of our original function we automatically have the domain and the range of our inverse they're just reversed and that's that makes it so much nicer than trying to find domain twice and trying to find range twice so we're gonna do that first secondly i need you to think of this x in the broadest possible sense what i need to think of it is as whatever's here must be somewhere between negative pi over 2 and pi over 2. i have interval notation and inequality notation but in all these cases we'll mostly use this one i'm going to show you why that is i'm just making the transition because i know i've used this and i want you to be familiar with this as well so in the broadest sense of it whatever's inside my function must be somewhere between these values and we're going to use that to find domain the last thing we're going to talk about is range remember what range is the biggest possible value sine can ever get is one and same for cosine and the smallest possible value sine can never get is negative one same for cosine tangent goes from negative infinity to positive infinity or positive to negative you reflect it and we're going to use that to find our range as well so i'm going to lead you through a series of steps they're obviously not all that hard if you remember how to find the inverse of any function then the inverse of this is exactly the same we're just going to use the appropriate inverse like sine inverse for sine cosine versus cosine and so forth so let's get started before we go anywhere when finding an inverse function we want to find the domain and we want to find the range and so here's what we do for the domain we look inside this we identify what tree function we have 5 sine x plus 2 in that parenthesis is very important saying that plus 2 is outside of the function it's not inside that it's not it's not a left or right phase shift if you will this is a vertical shift so it's affecting the outputs it's not affecting the domain that's important it's not nice and input it's not affecting the domain and so we're identifying firstly well what function we have if we have sine as we do here we know that the domain has to be this in order for us to be able to find an inverse function that's that's got to really make sense it's got to make sense that we had to cut the domain so that we had a one-to-one function so that we could find an inverse well what that means is that we still have to obey this and here's the way i'm always going to lead you to find domain with our trig functions at least for the inverses we're going to take whatever's here and put it in between whatever's here for the appropriate function in this case it's just x so we're going to say all right for our domain because we're dealing with sine and we can only find the inverse of sine on a very certain portion of the x-axis so where we have a one-to-one function that's negative pi over two to pi over two whatever's here if it's not just x like x plus five x minus one uh three x plus two whatever that is goes here for the appropriate function that you have that's the easiest way to find domain and it's also why i'm leading you to inequality notation rather than interval because you can actually do math on this and it's easiest way to go so we say what function okay find the domain where we can find inverse we got it put whatever's there right there and then you would solve it now this is why we learned about compound inequalities such a long long time ago so that you can solve things like this now this has nothing to do you're solved you're done you have just found your domain done and that's very very nice so we know that in order to find the inverse of sine we must be between these two values for input of x hopefully that makes sense the next thing we do is find the range now there's a variety of ways you can do this sometimes you'll hear people say hey just plug this in plug this in i'll give you a range that's not quite true because it doesn't have to give you the peak and the valley right at those points so here's maybe a better way to go about it think about the smallest possible value that this function can be don't even worry about this just what's the highest and lowest values that sine can be well the lowest value sign can be is negative one well imagine that somewhere in this continuous part of this function on this domain you're gonna get a negative one so let's imagine that so imagine hey sine of x can in its minimum be negative one negative one times five plus negative five plus 2 is negative 3. so it seems right that the very lowest value you could possibly get here's is negative 3. that's this oh man the the smallest thing you get here is negative 1 times 5 plus 2 is negative 3. and you could actually get it out you would use a bracket there now what's the largest value well sine of x whatever the the largest sign could ever get right here this little piece is 1. 5 times 1 is 5 plus 2 is 7. so the largest value this function could be is 7. so we're just really taking what the the range of our original sine function is made one to one and using those smallest and largest values and imagining somewhere in that interval you're going to get them and then times five plus two or the four either negative one or one is going to give you the smallest and largest values and everything between because we have a continuous part of that function now you can also see it this way it's more common to see interval notation but you can't see it both ways so we find domain no problem we can use domain to find the range we can plug it in you could do this sine of negative pi over 2 is negative 1. 5 times negative 1 plus 2 is negative 3 sine of pi over 2 is 1 5 times 1 plus 2 is 7. that's that's also okay to do now that we've determined our domain and range it's going to be so useful because we're going to go ahead and go through the process of finding the inverse function and once we do we'll already have the domain and the range for it range will become domain domain will become range but it's way easier to do it here than after you're done so how many oh i hope you remember how to actually find inverse functions it's a several step process the first step is instead of using function notation replace your f of x or g of x or whatever your function name is with y no problem that's pretty easy after that we change our y into an x and our x's into y's and then we solve for the y why because in doing that it's actually operation for operation function for function undoing whatever you have here so when we replace y with x and x with y and i tell you hey solve for y you're gonna have to undo the plus two you're gonna undo the times five you're gonna have to undo the function sign with an inverse that's completely undoing this that's what inverses do inverses undo functions term for term operation preparation function for function so we're going to go ahead and solve for y right now when you have to solve an inverse or solve for a variable like this you have to isolate whatever function you're dealing with so we're going to isolate that sign you also have to undo everything around the function so no no addition no subtraction no multiplication nothing so we'll divide both sides by five and lastly how in the world you solve for y now this is why we introduced inverse functions inverse functions undo the the root function of the parent function so if we have sine of y what are the sign inverse that's how we introduce it we know that they undo each other we are going to purposely introduce a composition of an inverse and its root function a composition of an inverse and function or a function and inverse always cancel that was the whole last video that's why we did that but you had to meet the domain that's exactly why we do the domain first to say hey this is only going to be valid if we meet this where'd this come from where our cut up x-axis caused us to have a one-to-one function so that we could even have an inverse so this says this is when it's one-to-one this is when it's one-to-one so that you'll be able to find an inverse let's go ahead and do it we're right here and it says because you've met your domain now you can actually find or use the inverse because it will be one-to-one on this portion of the x-axis that's the whole thing all wrapped up it's pretty cool so when we do a sine inverse once you do to one side you have to do it on the other and you have to put it in order so we're going to have sine inverse of the left side universal right and here's here it is again sine inverse of sine of y we know that inverse functions kill off functions if you compose a function's inverse they're done you're just going to get y and the reason why this works is because this domain fits this it's because we we cut it we said on this part it's one to one it satisfies the inverse and that right there is our inverse function we just have to call it that so we're going to say instead of y we're going to name it back as the function that we had with an inverse notation so f with that little negative one thing that we say f inverse don't say after the negative one or f little minus one thing for that before two um this is pronounced f inverse so this is f inverse it's the inverse of f these are inverse functions we've named that that says f inverse is sine inverse of x minus two plus five now if you were to compose these these should actually cancel out and you can probably see it check this out if you compose this here where that is sine of sine inverse would immediately cancel because you met that domain you'd have x minus 2 over 5 5 over 5 cancels x minus 2 plus 2 gives you x and that's exactly what should happen when you compose a function inverse everything should cancel and you should get x at the very end and that would actually happen either way we compose those provided around that domain now the last thing we're going to do because we already figured out the domain and the range remember that with inverse functions they switch so the range is now our domain and what we see is that our input has to be between negative 3 and 7 inclusive and our output f of f inverse of x that is the output for this function will be between negative pi over 2 and pi over 2. so we just take these we switch them because inputs become outputs outputs become inputs that happen right here so our domain and range also have to change notice something remember that the the inputs for sine inverse are from negative one to one check out what happens if you plug in negative three negative three minus two is negative five negative five over negative five sorry negative five over five is negative one seven seven minus two is five five over five is one this is the boundary of the smallest and largest values we could even put into sine inverse that's why we did it first here so it makes sense there so find domains find range and switch them for your inverse that's really all there is we're going to do maybe two more examples talking about cosine and tangent just so we can be complete but this is the whole idea the hardest part is finite domain then finding range from it that's actually not as hard this should make sense we've done inverses a lot so what we're going to do is come back and do a couple more examples let's get right to it so we have g of x equals negative tangent of x plus 1 minus 3. find your domain first so we're going to recognize what function we're dealing with tangent on what portion of the x-axis can we actually find an inverse on what portion is it one to one well that was negative pi over two to pi over two but not inclusive so not using that uh less than or equal to but just a strictly less than so here's what we're going to do we're going to say this we can find it an inverse on that interval let's write the boundaries there remember we're using x in the most general terms so this can be whatever is there let's start by showing our our left and right portions of our inequality notation for our domain so we know we know that whatever's here has to be between negative pi over two and pi over two since we're dealing with tangent whatever's here has to be between negative pi over two and pi over two so we're going to show that and say okay this part has to end up being between these two things let's just put this here and solve for x if you solve for x it will find your domain for you which is really nice that just means we have to subtract one if you remember compound inequalities what you do to the middle you do to both sides as well so x plus one minus one gives us x pi over two minus one is pi over two minus one and negative pi over two minus one is negative pi over 2 minus 1. now that's a pretty awkward domain but that is your domain that gives you the smallest and largest values not inclusively that you could plug into this and actually get something out i thought that's interesting to you what if you were to plug in this value in this value just like the regular tangent function if you were to plug in pi over 2 and negative pi over 2 you would get undefined they were vertical asymptotes if you remember that that's why there's no equals there that's why there's no equals here and here i hope you like that technique i hope it actually makes sense to you sometimes it looks like magic where did that come from it's not hard identify the function identify the domain and put whatever's there in between them and then solve it you just found your domain now as far as your range is concerned we need to understand where tangent goes tangence ranges from negative infinity to infinity well if this goes eventually from negative infinity to negative to positive infinity major infinity times a negative that's positive infinity plus three it's still positive infinity what about positive infinity times negative one be negative infinity plus three is still negative infinity so our range is still going to be all real numbers here so we've taken the time we said tangent must be between negative pi over two and pi over two oh sorry the um the domain of tangent is between negative pi over two and pi over two this is what we put between there we see this has to fit there and then we solve it range is not too bad and now we're going to solve for the inverse function so we're going to replace our function name g of x with y we're going to switch our y to x and our x's to y and then we're going to solve for y so let's uh let's go ahead and let's add three we're going to try to isolate that tangent and then use a tan inverse you cannot use a tan inverse you can't use any inverse function without the function right by itself like that so we're going to add 3 and then divide by negative 1 actually so adding 3 we'll divide by negative 1. if we divide by negative one this whole thing is over negative one and we get negative x minus three now we're ready to take tan inverse so we're i'm going to write that i'm going to write tan inverse on both sides don't ignore that don't don't be fancy about it just like well i know what's going to happen it's it's fairly important to show what's going on here so i'm going to write tan of y plus 1 and then tan inverse of the left-hand side of that it's important to get the side correct also and then negative x minus three and tan inverse on the left-hand side of that do these cancel if you will do they simplify when we get y plus one yes because we're identifying the domain on which that is possible if we don't identify the domain it makes it seem like you do it all the time well you can't because tangent is not a one to one function we had to restrict this so that this would be one-to-one when we're dealing with it that's why that's why we had to deal with domain when you're first going through domain you know why is this important it's important because it lets what we want to do be possible without doing that and restricting it we can't do that which we want to do right now so we're going to get just y plus one when we compose inverses with functions or they're basically their base function they they simplify we just get y plus one on the left hand side we get tan inverse of negative x minus three we simply need to subtract one and we'll have solve for the inverse function then we'll name it as g inverse notice it's not f inverse is a super common mistake it's not a huge deal but it is an important one that if your function is g of x you don't want to be going and writing f inverse because that it doesn't make sense this is the inverse of the function g so subtracting one we get tan inverse of negative x minus three and then minus one we're going to call this g inverse of x if you were to compose it this whole thing would fit in that variable what's the first thing you do you take this whole thing and then you would add one with negative one plus one is zero tangent of the tan inverse would give you negative x minus three that negative would say let's see positive x plus three so x plus three minus three give you x it actually works if you compose these that's a great way to check your work you don't have to but if you're curious like hey does it does actually work out yeah it does but it only does it if this is the input for that function and likewise if we find the domain and range for inverse whatever this is so our domain is our range from our original function so our domain says you can actually do this with anything in your inverse function all real numbers would work there why because the the the domain of your inverse tangent is all real numbers plug in anything it's going to work just fine the range however the range is the domain that we had here that says that your inverse function will at at minimum give you negative pi over 2 minus 1 but not including that that will be a oh my gosh it'll be a horizontal asymptote do you remember that about tan inverse how it has this horizontal asymptote we're between it just like the tangent itself had vertical asymptote and we're between it so we went like that this will have a minimum of this but not ever reach its horizontal asymptote and then it will uh it will get a maximum of negative pi over two plus one and that's exactly what this this says for us so i hope that makes sense um kind of nice finding domain and range first right because you just reverse them just make sure that when you do that you understand that your range becomes your domain for your input variable that your g inverse of x should not go here this is your input we're talking about and likewise for your range you should not have an x there it should have your inverse function the function will be between whatever your domain was whatever your x was between here for your domain that's the point so we'll come back we'll do one more we'll talk about cosine okay just about down so we have h of x equals 2 cosine 3x plus 2 and then minus 1. find your domain first means look at the part of the cosine function that you need to restrict so that you have a one-to-one function and we have that right here cosine has to be between cosine has to have a domain between zero and pi or in the broad sense of a term whatever's here must give you something between zero and pi whatever's here must fit between zero and pi period including 0 to pi so let's go ahead and do that if we take our domain we have identified this as cosine so we're looking from 0 to pi write it out first cosine's domain must fit there the whatever's inside cosine must give you something between there well if this is our domain and this is what's got to fit let's put this between there so identify cosine 0 pi take this and put it between those two values and then we solve them how we solve for x remember for those for double inequalities or compound inequalities here we we solve for x but we're very careful if you ever have to divide by a negative remember you've got to switch your inequalities we're not going to see that a whole lot but you can get it be very careful with that if your domain's getting messed up and you have it out of order make sure that you've actually switched your inequalities so here we're going to subtract 2 from all of this and then we'll divide by three on all three portions of this it looks kind of nasty but those are numbers that is the smallest and largest value that you can plug into this and get a one to one portion of that function that's why we did it cosine is one to one on on zero to pi in general if you start altering what you're plugging in altering that argument you start altering whatever is giving you one to one part this is now what's giving you a one-to-one piece of that function therefore this is the only piece that's relevant for us to find an inverse because we only find inverses of one to one functions this causes that to happen so this is our necessary domain for us to do the rest of our work is cosine defined everywhere yes it is it is defined everywhere but it's not one to one everywhere and so we've got to cut it to make it one to one so that we can find an inverse then we find our range as far as the range is concerned we don't really have to do a whole lot of work like this just imagine cosine i don't care about this the largest that cosine can well i sort of care about it um there are some times that um that you're going to get out some weird things normal it's it's very rare but it can affect it most of the time what happens is you say hey cosine the largest value you can get is one and the smallest way you get out is negative one so cosine of whatever is going to give you biggest one smallest negative one let's let's talk about negative one the smallest value is gonna give negative one so two times negative one is negative two minus one is negative three the largest value is positive one cosine can only get you out between negative one and one i don't care what you plug in that's the smallest amount of value you can get so positive one times two is two minus one is one we show two different ways this is going to become the domain of our new function and the range of our new function our inverse function so let's find the inverse we're going to start by replacing h of x with y we're going to change the y to an x all of our x's into y's then we're going to solve for that y thereby undoing this function and that's what inverses come from is undoing a function so we've got to isolate this cosine so that we can use cosine inverse you have to get rid of your constants first so we're going to add 1 and divide by 2 that's our coefficient or our common our constant factor if you want to so add one divide by two now that we've done that add 1 divided by 2 we've isolated the function that we want to find the inverse 4. the only thing that's going to get rid of cosine is cosine inverse we have to do the same thing on both sides and the same position on both sides so we're going to do cosine inverse because we've identified this correctly this is giving us a one to one part of this particular function on which we can find an inverse this says now it's possible let's go ahead and do that we're going to get 3y plus 2 equals cosine inverse of x plus 1 over 2. almost done we're now going to subtract 2 and then after that divide by 3. just remember where you subtract 2 is important you're going to subtract it not from the argument of cosine so not from that actually it's a it's a x coordinate point but outside of that so subtract two like right there and then when you divide by three you can do it a couple ways you can divide the whole thing by three um most you can do both terms divided by three you can do that as well most times you'll see a one-third though so if you divide by three it's got to be all three terms or you need to put this whole thing in parentheses have a one-third in front that right there is the inverse function we're going to call it that we're going to say this is h inverse stemming from the original name of h of x and this decidedly has a domain and a range that are important have you already found them so the domain is the range of your original function domain of an inverse is the range of your original one so negative 3 to 1 but now this is our input so another reason i like to show inequality notation for inverses so that you really see what's going on this isn't this isn't the y value this is this is the new input value for the inverse same thing for range our range is this is smallest and largest value but we'll have h inverse instead of x because this is our output our outputs for that inverse function i really hope that makes sense to you i hope that you understand the necessity to use this domain so that we have a one-to-one piece of whatever function we're dealing with so that an inverse is actually possible we can only find inverses of one to one functions that's we cut it make it one-to-one and then to find your domain and range first is very nice i hope you're seeing that i hope that i've made it very clear on how you do it identify your function your smallest and largest values put whatever's here between them and solve it remember if you divide by a negative your inequalities switch you pick the whole thing up off the board and reverse it it does not happen very often but it can can't happen and then your domain becomes your range of your inverse function range becomes domain that's about it all i really want to show you on that i hope it's made sense next time what we're going to do is solve some very basic equations with inverse functions have a great day
