Transcript for: Properties of Functions - Extrema (Precalculus - College Algebra 10)
hey welcome to another video today we're going to talk about extrema local or relative and absolute extrema what that means is local maxes local mins absolute maxes absolute mins talking about high points and low points of our graph so let me explain the difference between local Max and min or relative maximum and absolute then we'll just go through some examples and learn exactly how to determine local Max and min through graphs we won't be able to do it very well with algebraic expressions because we pretty much need calculus to do that in something called a derivative and a horizontal tangent and some things that we are not ready for but get an idea about what they mean now is important so that when we find them later in calculus you'll understand what what we're finding so what a local or a relative maximum or minimum means is that in an open interval a little neighborhood of your graph you have a high point or a low point that's pretty much what a local or relative maximum mean the definition of it is that on this open interval we have this value that is higher or equal to all the other values around it for it a little neighborhood nothing tire graph there just a little neighborhood of an open interval of the x axis so the values seen would be called a local max one thing that are saying right now when you're finding a local Max or local man or absolute max Raps of min the output value is the maximum or minimum it occurs at a point X comma that output X comma the local Max X comma the local man or absolute max absolute min but the output value itself is what we're talking about as far as a local max Ehrmann that should make sense the maximum output would be an output value an absolute maximum output would be an output value again so keep there to mind we're finding the value of the output at a certain x value for our input so an easy way to remember that as far as what a local match your local min is what where to look for a local maximum is going to generally occur like 9 amperes on the time it's going to generally occur where we change think about this where we change from increasing to decreasing on that change remember that the increase in is open and the decrease is open and where they change we didn't include that point on increasing or decreasing well that point itself is where the change happens that point itself is a local Max or lumen so when we change from increasing to decreasing we're going to have a little peak there that peak is our local maximum or where that local maximum occurs so we are going to generally look for a function changes from increasing to decreasing and that's going to give us a relative or a local maximum a neighborhood of points it's open interval where we have one value higher than all the other ones higher than or equal to all the ones around it likewise for a local relative min we're gonna have this value that's that's lower than or a small and gray less than or equal to all the other values around it on an open interval of points it's a little neighborhood generally that happens where function changes from decreasing to increasing well we're having a little trough there so we've fallen and then we've changed from decreasing to increasing well where that change occurs where you're no longer decreasing and you're not starting to increase yet that little point that that's where your local minimum is going to occur a couple things to note about this you do not have to have local maxes or local mins on any of your graphs you also don't have to have absolute maxima none in your graphs but where they occur is going to be a change from increasing to decreasing most likely or a decrease an increasing for local minimum the y say most likely there are some cases where we have constants that this can come into play so I need to understand that also you can have more than one place where the same local maximum occurs you also have more than one place on the same absolute maximum incursion or likewise a minimum so the main idea is look for areas of your graph where your change is increasing to decreasing for maxes and decreasing for bids as far as relative or local maximum absolute maximum just means the highest and lowest point that your graph attains so the absolute maximum is going to be this this thing that you never get a value higher than that that's an output absolute Mensing to this value that you never get a value lower than that for a under graph as far as a output is concerned so a few things to note you also you don't have to get these either that they could not be non-existent on your graphs but where they occur you're going to get you're going to get this actual physical point that you do not attain a value higher than that I need to make a note that every closed interval brackets every closed interval will guarantee you that you have an absolute max and an absolute min that and that would be a closed continuous no gaps no jumps no no separating things there are no asymptotes then you can guarantee they of announcement max in it without that condition you cannot guarantee it so every closed interval that's continuous is going to have both an absolute maximum I'm going to put the word continuous up here I'm gonna spell right so every close continuous interval gonna have an absolute maximum we're going to try these right now with with one one thing I need to make sure that last thing you know is uh that local or relative maxes cannot occur at endpoints absolute maxes mins can occur angles so one last time all the way through what local means is on the neighborhood so on this little thing you change from increasing to decreasing local Max or decreasing increasing local maybe yellow peak or you have a trough on your graph somewhere in a little neighborhood points any points don't qualify because it's defined as an open interval your endpoint is not on an open interval your endpoint is on a closed interval you can't get past that endpoint to determine whether you change from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing you don't have that point being higher than all the the points around it because there's no neighborhood to look at and so we do not include endpoints for local maxes or local mins absolute maxes and mins that's the highest point or lowest point in your graph every closed continuous intervals you don't have that and we can't allow endpoints because we're just looking for the highest value in tank that's the idea keep in mind that all these things are the output value they occur at a point and so the point itself is not really a local max local min absolute max absolute min it's just where that occurs the output value is the maximum and we'll be looking forward so we're going to do how do I mean that is looks like six examples I'm just going to go through what the local max local min absolute Max absolute min is what they are I'm going to change this last one to make it work for us and talk about how the absolute Max and min the absolute maximum value can occur in more than one place we have to define that and so here we go as far as a local Max is concerned we may look for a local Max we are looking for a point where our fun in general change from increasing to decreasing or a neighborhood of the x-axis little interval x-axis we have a high point a little peak so that right there this graph changes from increasing to decreasing it has a little peak in this neighborhood of points on the x-axis that's the highest point that there is so our local maximum is not too it's not too comma for the local maximum is for it occurs at the point 2 4 but you see the difference you should see the difference the maximum value in that little neighborhood is 4 that is what we're talking about just occurs at the doubt at the point 2 comma 4 likewise there is a local minimum or a relative minimum you say either one the local minimum well wherever we change from decreasing to increasing very little trough wherever we have a neighborhood of points where we have a smallest point that would be right here so we're decreasing up we're increasing where the change happens negative 2 comma 1 that's where local minimum is so the minimum value is 2 it occurs at the point negative 1 comma 2 this is not a local minimum this is not a local maximum the reason why is because there's no neighborhood around it it stops right there you go well what about what's next I don't know what's next so you can't say that it's changing from decreasing to increasing because you don't know what's next you can't say it's on an open interval so we can't say that that's the smallest point on the open interval to define a local max remains so it might seem like a nuance but we can't include our endpoints for local Max or relative Max or relative min we can do it for absolute Max Ehrmann and so when we look at the absolute max what we're looking for is the highest value attained by your ear function notice one thing about it can it elves can it occurred something that's also a local max yes does it have to know so in general we look at our local maxes and we look our our endpoints and whatever is the out of those that's your absolute max so we look here to Elm is that the highest value for or is my end point the highest value is this end point the highest value so I'm looking at output output elbow that's the highest output that right there says that this end point is where my absolute maximum occurs on being very specific among wording here the absolute maximum is 5 where it occurs as negative 4 comma 5 can they be at local maxes yes do they have to be no they can be endpoints locals cannot be endpoints absolutes can absolute minimum let's see the lowest value attained by our graph let's look at our outputs 5 2 4 1 okay that's the smallest output we have it doesn't go any lower than that my local minimum it has a value of 2 right in this neighborhood my absolute minimum has a value of 1 it occurs an endpoint that is okay it's 1 at the point 5 1 and this should be making sense to you at this at this point now climb 10 then that the the value of the output is our Max or min and where it occurs is if there's a point so let's look at the next one so we're going to go up here the next one if we look at that that is a continuous function on a closed interval do you see the same thing here there's no there's no gaps there's no missing points like we have in these there's no asymptotes that we're trying to not that we can't cross over this graph right here is going to have an absolute max and an absolute min that doesn't guarantee we have the local matches are minced but a closed interval with the continuous curves go to guarantee that we have a highest value and a lowest value it's got to be that way so let's go ahead and identify our local Maxima local min first and their absolute Max and min so our local Max we're looking at our our graph and and seeing where we change from increasing to decreasing so here I'm decreasing here I'm increasing here I'm doing okay so I'm changing from increasing to decreasing that's going to create a peak and neighborhood where we have a high wait the local max here right there is five at the point 3 comma 5 we also have a local min so where we change from decreasing to increasing oh it would decrease okay now increasing that point right there when we change from decreasing increasing it's a little trough that local minimum is negative 1 that's our output value at the point negative one maybe one that's where that occurs we never include endpoints for local master mins of this not included that cannot be included because we don't have an open interval absolute Max or min so now we're looking just for the highest value that occurred so the highest output our outputs are 2 negative 1 0 & 5 the highest of those values occurs actually at that local Max so the absolute max is also 5 add 3 comma 5 but for a different reason than this so the local max is a change where we change from increasing to decreasing or in a neighborhood of points we have a high point it does not have to be the highest point in your graph does it because this is still a local max but it's not the highest point this is a local Max for the same reason this one is it's a change from increasing to decreasing in a little open interval it's the high point just looking at like when you zoom in oh that's a little peak right there but it's not the highest point it's at the highest point here it is also the highest point here so the local is just a zoomed in idea and absolute is the big picture so big picture the 5 is also the highest value we've ever attained it just so happens that it's also occurring a local max in this case put an end point in this case absolute mins same thing that's the minimum here it's 2 5 0 negative 1 the negative 1 is the lowest value that we get it happens to occur at a local minimum and not an endpoint here so you can have absolute maximum of the same as other local maximum or at endpoints generally that's where they're going to occur on continuous curves is absolute Max or min is going to occur at a local or at an endpoint and using calculus when we get there for continuous differentiable curves we look at that we look at the the local measurement critical points give us those and we look at end points and determine what's our absolute maximum or minimum all right I want to go on to this one then this one then this one amount so we're moving over here now we're missing some points that's what those little open circles mean they say you you get close to it but then we're just removing one little point like a removable disk company it's only a discontinuity so this is no longer a continuous function which means that this whole hey every closed interval is going to add one of these that's true if we have a continuous function and we're going to see how we're moving that point really affects a lot of what we're going to do so let's see do we have a point where we have changed from increasing to decreasing well we're increasing increasing increasing increasing increasing decreasing so at that point if there was a point there we would have a local max we would have a peak we'd say hey in the neighborhood around this this little open interval we have a high point that this value is higher than anything around it but if I take that point out they say well that's no longer there well then we will still increase forever here this is still increasing it never stops increasing this is decreasing it never stops well it never actually has a point where you're not decreasing on this open interval so we can't actually change we can't have a point where it's neither increasing nor decreasing everything up to the three is increasing everything after the three on the x-axis is decreasing where the value that were changes it has been removed therefore we don't have an actual point on an open interval that's higher than anything else let's say this is the highest point we don't have that and so we do not have a local max here we would but we took it away so there's none we also have no local minimum or relative minimum and it's not just because this point is gone it's because we never change from decreasing to increasing endpoints can't be included in those anyhow and there's not even an endpoint there so we're always decreased here there's no value that's the literal lowest in a neighborhood of points an open interval that doesn't occur with with any points in general or even at this open missing point because you can always be a little bit lower a little bit lower a little bit lower there's no solid point that's the lowest in a neighborhood same thing here endpoint we've failed to be on a neighborhood of open interval so there's no local max there's also no local minimum is there absolute maximum no for the same reason that there's no local max here there's no actual physical point that you say this is the highest I can attain you can get like like 4.9 can't you we need 3 comma or close to three comma four point nine or four point 99 or for what I own a night but you never get an actual highest value because we're missing that five you never get to the five for that output and so we don't have an absolute max do we have an absolute min sure we do this doesn't continue to go down this kind of fizzles out as we approach a height of two so if X is six but height is two but we do have a lowest point of negative three on that end point and that occurs at zero negative 30 so notice you can still have some absolute Max and min if we if we don't have a closed continuous an interval that's closed and a continuous group on that but you can still have them you know it's just as a guarantee it anymore so yeah no local max there's no point there no local man we have nowhere when we change from decreasing to increasing absolute max again there's no point absolutely okay we can now include that end point that's the lowest value that we have let's go you know what let's do that one so do we have a local max thing for yourself is there a point to find point not open where we change from increasing to decreasing we're on an open interval little neighborhood we have a high point yeah we have right there so the local maximum is 4 it occurs at the point to comfy do we have a local and there's only one of them do we have a local minimum yeah yeah we have a point where we've changed from decreasing to increasing there's a little trough here we know that in the neighborhood around this point that's the lowest spot has a height of 1 at the point negative one level do we have an absolute maximum sure we do we have a high point on this graph right there at that local max that's also the highest value attained on this distress so we have an absolute max of 4 at the point 2 comma 4 just like our local max but for a different reason it's just the highest point that we get do we have an absolute min well no no this graph decreases increases and decreases and it keeps on decreasing forever and ever never as X approaches whatever that vertical asymptote is this graph approaches negative infinity so we're not gonna say negative infinity is the absolute max even though that's where the limit as we approach the x value would go the limits value would say yes it goes to negative infinity the limit is as we get closer and closer to something on the x axis our graph approaches something on the y axis that's basically what when it does a value of from the y axis here we don't have a an actual value though so an absolute Max has to be a point a value that we attained that happens to be the lowest value on the graph there's there's a time here we wouldn't have put negative infinity we wouldn't do that all right moving forward can you have more than one local maximum and more than one local minimum absolutely you can so here when we look at this we're decreasing and then increasing okay that's a local minimum or increasing and then decreasing okay that's a local maximum or decreasing and increasing that's a different local minimum it's okay to have several local mins and local maxes because we're looking at individual little neighborhoods individual little open intervals so you could have a craft this just does this all day long and you have hundreds of local maxes and hundreds of local minutes they could even occur the same value like well sine and cosine when we get there we're gonna see they have an infinite number of local maxes every PI or PI over two intervals you're gonna get this oh here's the peak there's another trouble there's something there's another trough like a little roller coaster over and over and over and they get the same height again and again you just have a different local Max and local min at every single one of those X values so our local max here and change from increasing to decreasing right there then that in an open interval the highest value is five and it occurs at the point zero five local minimum we have two so we have one where we change a decrease increase in here careful the height is zero that's the local minimum it occurs at negative two zero we have another one decreasing the increase in local minimum we have a height of 1 at the point 3 comma 1 so we certainly can have multiple local maxes because their neighborhood oriented they're just a little open interval around a certain point where that point is the highest point of any neighborhood absolute max what do you think absolute max have some X no absolute max no it goes to infinity so as we're approaching that as we're approaching whatever this numbers on the x axis our graph is going to positive infinity for there for that reason we have no absolute max we do have an absolute minimum so we're looking at the output values 3 5 1 0 0 is the lowest value that's attained by this function therefore that's the absolute minimum at this point this should be really making sense like ok I understand that the the value the output value is the local max local man absolute max absolute min I should be understanding that on continuous curve on a closed interval has to have a highest in the lowest point as soon as I mess with that start taking points out start having non closed intervals like these well then we start removing that necessity we start looking at just okay is there a highest point as their lowest point it could occur at a local max Ehrmann or it could occur to end point local maximum cannot occur at endpoints because they have to be based on open intervals but we could have more than one of them you will only have one absolute maximum get out many different local Max and local mins let's check out one more maybe you see it you should be seeing that there is no local Max ooh even though we change from increasing to decreasing at once you move there's another local min here even though we changed or decreasing to increasing there's the point's been removed there's no absolute max highest point Harrison on it gets closer and closer to five that never gets there absolute min there is none you closer and closer whatever this height is but it never actually achieves that about you can get closer and closer that better gets there now let me change it just look so nothing nothing on this guy let me change it a little bit let's put that point there let's say it's negative 4 comma 5 does this graph have a local max now yes the local maximum is 5 it occurs at the point 5 5 does it have a local minimum no that points still missing a local let's see absolute minimum nope no at this point still missing this is not the lowest point it does get lower than that but it never achieves the a lowest point does it have an absolute max yes and an absolute maximum can occur at more than one x value because you need to understand what an absolute max is an absolute Max just says what's the highest output you attain well the highest output i attain is 5 now it occurs in more than one place but then is the highest value this graph gets so absolute max here it's 5 that's the highest value it occurs at two different places at five five and eighty four five so hopefully they explains it to you what local or relative maximum in our well how they're defined what why it's important that you can't include endpoints it's an open idea how you can have more than one of them at different values that's okay just every peak every trough that we have that's defined has a defined point and how absolute maximum is just the highest value on a graph can occur if endpoints or it can occur at local maximum so and in a good curve at more than one place so no problem so hopefully that makes sense to you I'm gonna come back and talk about about average rate of change in just a little bit you
