Transcript for: How to Graph Tangent and Cotangent (Precalculus - Trigonometry 13)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about the graphs of tangent and cotangent much like we talked about the graphs of sine and cosine and then another video on how to transform those we're going to do the same thing here so we're going to discuss in this video where tangent and cotangent come from graphically so back to the inner circle we're going to take a look at that and see where these points come from why tangent and cotangent look the way that they do then in the next video we're going to shift them around so this can be kind of a quicker video for us i'm just getting a feel for white why in the world there is a vertical asymptote every so often on tangent cotangent why we have this repeated x-intercept every so often when with tangent cotangent how they're related to one another whether we have even or odd functions out of them so that's what we're getting we're getting some understanding here we also want to pay close attention to some of these key features right here because what's going to happen in the next few videos is i'm going to show you how to transform tangent and cotangent and we're going to see oh if i can identify the period then i know that something happens at the ends something happens in the center and something happens at the corners of the period just like sine and cosine and so that's very important for us to understand so let's take a look at tangent first and there's something i need to point out remember that tangent is that relationship right there on a unit circle so tangent of theta the central angle is given by the y-coordinate over the x-coordinate so when we get down to our graph so we start plotting some points we really want to make sure that we're comparing for every single angle which remember angles can represent the arc length so any real number on a unit circle that's because it's unit circle with radius of one and what we're doing basically is taking a real number allowing it to be an arc length that is also the same thing as a central angle and therefore we can find out a ratio of a y coordinate divided by an x coordinate for any real number that we can plug into tangent and these real numbers that don't give us anything else we call them undefined we're going to get a vertical asymptote so let's get started now we're going to start with tangent on where the x-intercepts are so we're going to take a look at this okay let's see if if tangent theta is y over x then x-intercepts happen where the numerator equals zero and the denominator doesn't that's only way to get zero out of a fraction is where the numerator equals zero and denominator doesn't so if tangent of theta is y over x then tangent of theta or any real number is going to equal 0 if y is 0 when x is not now there's nowhere where both y and x are zero so that's very easy we're just going to take a look and see at what angles y equals zero well the first one is here at zero so tangent of zero is going to give us zero tangent of pi is going to give us zero why well because tangent compares the y coordinate over the x zero over one is zero zero over negative one is zero and those are the only two places on a unit circle where the y is zero and x is not so we'd have tangent of zero is zero over one tangent of pi is zero over negative one those are both zero so what's going to happen is we're going to have zeros at plug in zero this relates to remember this relates to an angle here so tangent of zero says plug in zero okay you got it you're gonna get zero one that's zero there will be therefore an x intercept at the origin now how about pi plug in pi we're going to get tangent of pi is 0 1 that's also 0. and this is true for every multiple of pi we are going to get x intercepts every 0 plus k pi or minus k pi so there's gonna be another zero at negative pi and negative two pi at pi and at two pi and at three pi we keep going and going and going and going and going what we're going to find out with tangent is the period is half of what it is for sine cosine and and secant cosecant it's going to be just pi and we're going to get a 0 every every 0 or an x intercept every 0 and then pi and then 2 pi 3 pi all the way forever so we could write something like that maybe make a little note that x intercepts happen at zero plus k pi now something unique happens with tangent that didn't happen with sine and cosine we're going to come up with some values that they're undefined now sine and cosine they were defined everywhere our domain was all real numbers that was fantastic but tangent doesn't act like that why not well because sine is just the y coordinate and the y coordinate kind of oscillates between negative one and one and and cosine was just the x coordinate and oscillate between negative one and one and between that interval we get all real numbers negative one one to one and this angle goes all the way around from zero to 360 degrees or zero to two pi and there's never an angle that's excluded from that and every single one of those is mapped to an output either x or y there's never a domain issue there's never a range issue but tangent is a ratio so tangent is y over x now we know something about fractions we know that when our denominator is zero we have a significant issue we have something that's undefined so let's take a look at our unit circle and figure out for which angles x is zero you see at the angles where x is zero we're going to get something over zero something over zero is undefined okay so if x is zero we get problems um x is zero here and x is zero here or think about it as a negative angle negative pi over two x is zero at pi over two x is also zero at negative pi over two or at three pi over two well every place that x is zero tangent of that angle is going to be undefined so let's look at that tangent of pi over two is one over zero uh undefined tangent of three pi over two well that's negative one over zero but it's still undefined tangent of negative pi over two is negative one over zero that's still undefined what that means for us remember the angle is what we have on our x-axis right now so we're taking these real numbers thinking of them as an arc length that equals a central angle so any real number and then we're evaluating it with our unit circle and saying okay um our angle represents something on this x-axis that's all pi's and stuff pi over 2 negative pi over 2 and 3 pi over 2 are going to have problems so why again is because we're dividing y by x and if x is zero it gives us something that's undefined that means that pi over two tangent of pi over two is undefined so right here we're going to have what's called a vertical asymptote you found this out like in the college algebra portion of precalculus that any time you divide a fraction by zero you get a vertical asymptote if you can't cancel it out and that's exactly the same watch that we have right here we are going to have a vertical asymptote of pi over two we also learned we'd have one at negative pi over 2 and at 3 pi over 2 and in fact we're going to have it at pi over 2 plus k pi now wait a minute plus k pi was the same thing for x intercepts plus k pi is the same thing for our vertical asymptotes plus k 2 pi was for sine and cosine that stuff it's plus the period so every period this is going to repeat again and again and again and again so at pi over 2 and 3 pi over 2 and negative pi over 2 and 5 pi over 2 and pi over 2 plus k pi we are going to have vertical asymptotes and that's what we have here so we have vertical asymptotes at pi over 2. yeah we got one of those plus every k pi every multiple of pi so 1 pi or negative 1 pi and then you add that so that's pi over 2 plus 1 pi would be 3 pi over 2 plus another pi would be 5 pi over 2 minus pi would be negative pi over 2 or negative 3 pi over 2 and we can get a vertical asymptote on the entire x-axis every pi over 2 plus or minus k pi oh well actually plus k pi k can be positive or negative integers and that's why we write it that way and this also creates a domain issue for us you see with sine and cosine our domain was all real numbers you plug in anything but with tangent it's not how we define our domain is all real numbers except for those values that are undefined and that's what we have here we have some undefinedness if you will at pi over 2 and every k pi so we're going to write that so domain is all real numbers but x cannot equal pi over 2. we saw that why not again because at pi over 2 x is 0 for this particular angle and y over x is going to give you something undefined now please get this we're about to discover that the period of tangent is pi the reason why this k pi is there is saying look if you have something that's undefined at pi over two then if you go another period it's still going to be undefined it's it's a it's a cycle of a function it's going to repeat every single period and so that means that if you add the period to it or a multiple period or subtract a period you're going to get another undefined place and that's what that says so this should be the same thing in your head you should understand that hey due to the fact that i have vertical asymptotes every place on my unit circle the x coordinate is zero well then what that means is that every so often i'm going to get a vertical asymptote at the same interval that also means that vertical asymptotes create domain problems for us so our domain is yeah all real numbers except pi over 2 plus or minus k pi how about a range well now this is this is quite interesting our range for sine and cosine is negative one to one but that's not true for tangent you see for tangent we can start getting comparisons of one divided by very very very small numbers that's going to create something that's more than more than one for by longitude close to positive infinity and all the way down to negative infinity and that's typically what vertical asymptotes do for us they say if as you get closer to it you got to kind of make a choice the function makes a choice here not really but it says you're going to have to go all the way like this or all the way like this and that's exactly what happens with our tangent so before we get there before we get our range is all real numbers we're going to write down in a minute i want to discover how these graphs actually look whether they're climbing or whether they're falling and they're going to be kind of an s curve for us so we're going to take a look at pi over 4 negative pi over 4 3 pi over 4 5 pi over 4 and we're going to see this pattern emerge so let's take a look at it how about pi over 4 tangent of pi over 4 is going to compare the y over the x and they're the same so wait a minute tangent to pi over 4 is going to give us 1. now tangent negative pi over 4 that's the same thing as 3 sorry 7 pi over 4. so tangent of negative pi over 4 and 7 pi over 4 they're the same we're going to get negative root 2 over 2 divided by positive square root 2 over 2. well that's negative 1. now how about three pi over four three pi over four is right here that's also negative one you should see it you should see y divided by x is negative one and five pi over four tangent of five pi over four says a negative divided by negative that's a positive one now what i really want i really want you to see the repetition here do you see that this is repeating negative 1 0 1 negative 1 0 1 vertical asymptote vertical asymptote vertical asymptote now how often are they repeating well they're repeating more often than every 2 pi in fact if you take a look at this from 0 to pi that's only adding pi 0 plus pi is pi or negative pi over 2 plus pi is pi over 2 or negative pi over 4 to 3 pi over 4 is adding pi to that so this period for tangent is more often than 2 pi it's every pi now why i really want you to get why this is not just memorize it it's easy to memorize it but understand why the reason why is because if tangent is a ratio it's comparing a positive and a negative well the reason why tangent occurred has a period sooner than 2 pi it's every pi is because positives divided by positives and negatives divided by negatives gives you gives you the same output also positive over negative or negative or positive give you the same output what i mean by that is we are going to get positives divided by positives here negatives of positives divided by negatives here but then negative divided by negative and positive divide negative divided by a positive gives you the same exact results so these two quadrants and these two quadrants have exactly the same tangent for whatever those angles are so tangent of angles here and here they start repeating well what is a repetition but a period and that's exactly what the period means how often things repeat so tangent repeats after these first two quadrants wait a second these first two quadrants are 0 to pi and then pi to 2 pi that's every pi that is the reason why the period of tangent and therefore cotangent is going to be pi and we can see it vertical asymptotes repeat every pi it says right there x intercepts repeat every pi it says right there we kind of notice that we're just putting some meat on the bones now so how this graph looks it almost looks like a cubic and it's going to repeat every pi interval so the period's pi is going to repeat every pi now is it even or odd well due to the fact that this is symmetric about the origin this is an odd function we can also see that opposite inputs pi pi over 4 and negative pi 4 are giving us opposite outputs that's exactly what what tangent does this is also what will say it's it's odd on its period and so if we start shifting this around we start getting oddness but it moves with that period it would not be odd in relation to the y-axis if we start transforming transforming this from from that original spot so we've learned why x-intercepts are at where they are and we've learned why vertical asymptotes are where they are we've learned why the periods even pi and we've kind of shown that now some important things to remember i need you to remember something you see what's going to happen next video is we're going to take one period of tangent and we're going to start transforming it we're going to shift it up we're going to shift it down or we're going to start stretching it and reflecting it changing the period here's what i need to know when we start changing the period it might change how how far we stretch this horizontally or compress it but it won't change the following it will not change that vertical asymptotes happen at the ends of your period this is one period this is another period the period is still pi and a vertical asymptote is going to happen at the ends of your period that's what i want you to write down so let's take a look at that let's kind of zoom in right here if this is one period this is what tangent looks like on the period from negative pi over two to pi over two that's from here to here well if our if this is one period and vertical asymptotes happen to the end what happens in the center our one and only x-intercept happens at the center of our period so periods here vertical asymptotes of the end-your period we're going to use this next time x-intercept in the center cool so the x-intercept is at the center of the period and then at the corners of our period hopefully you're seeing this hope you're seeing this like we did with sine and cosine we said at the ends something happens at the center something happens at the quarter something happens for tangent at the ends we have vertical asymptotes at the center we have an x-intercept at the quarters we have negative 1 and positive one respectively i'm not going to show the key points now but i certainly will when we get to graphing this and transformations what i want you to remember is that here's what's going to happen we're going to firstly identify our tangent and our our period we're going to mark the period on our x-axis right away after we mark that period we're going to go to the ends vertical asymptotes go to the center put an x-intercept go to the quarters of your period and do your x do your negative one and your positive one or at least write your key points so identify the quarters and write our key points our key points will be first quarter common negative one second quarter comma or i supposed to be third quarter third quarter comma positive one and then our key points from there we'll manipulate this it'll make um it's that it's a little bit not concrete that's a theory behind it so i'll show you that when we get there but at this point i need you to really recognize it yeah it ends the period we got vertical asymptote at the center is an x-intercept and here at the first quarter let's call it second quarter and a third quarter we're going to have negative one and positive 1. those will create key points and we'll manipulate them next time so let's move on and let's talk about cotangent of x so with cotangent of x instead of having tangent theta equals y over x cotangent is x over y it's a reciprocal so we're going to make this really easy when you reciprocate things zeros so zero over one changes to one over zero and one over zero changes to zero over one now why am i saying that well because if we compare this to tangent which is why i left it on the board all of our zeros become undefined and all of our undefined vertical asymptotes become zeros now let's check that on the unit circle make sure that's true so take a look at tangent remember we're talking about tangent here when x was 0 we had things that were undefined so that would be at pi over 2 and negative pi over 2 and 3 pi over 2 we got undefined where x was 0. but if you look at cotangent well that reciprocates it now x is on the numerator y is on the denominator so at pi over 2 we no longer get undefined for cotangent like we did for tangent we get just zero over one well that's zero what that means is that for cotangent at pi over two and negative pi over two three pi over two every place we had a vertical asymptote for tangent we're going to have an x-intercept for cotangent so negative pi over 2 and pi over 2 and 3 pi over 2 and x intercepts are now going to cause vertical asymptotes vertical asymptotes like we're seeing right now are causing x-intercepts so at pi over 2 plus or minus k pi remember these are reciprocals of one another they're very related now how about vertical asymptotes uh well tangent was zero when y was zero like here so we'd have y over x zero one yeah okay that makes sense that's zero but cotangent says reciprocate that well now that's one over zero that's undefined so where tangent had zeros at zero and pi and two pi and negative pi cotangent asymptotes there are vertical asymptotes wherever our tangent had an x-intercept so an x-intercept zero for tangent is a vertical asymptote of zero for cotangent we can see it at zero this should be one over zero for cotangent that's undefined at pi that's negative one over zero for cotangent remember cotangent is x over y that would be undefined and at negative pi that'd be negative one over zero in fact every period here every pi plus or minus so 0 plus or minus pi every k pi is going to give you a vertical asymptote finally this is kind of weird but notice that cotangent and tangent are going to have exactly the same value for pi over 4 and negative pi over 4 and every quarter of the period wait a minute what yeah for sure because tangent of pi over 4 is 1. cotangent just reciprocates that when you reciprocate one or negative one you still get one or negative one and so we're going to get exactly the same outputs but the period is different so it's going to look different and we can we can see it just it looks funny because it's broken up separately but look here's negative pi over four negative one that's the same exact value here's pi over four positive one power positive one nothing not a problem three pi over four negative one that's right these are repeating every pi that's what periods do they repeat things every so often if i take negative pi over four and add pi i'm at three pi over four at pi again i'd be at well whatever it's past that if i take uh negative three pi over four and add pi to pi over four add it again i'm at five pi over four it's repeating every pi every time i add pi it repeats that output just like we did for x intercepts just like we did for vertical asymptotes notice that these things are switched because they're reciprocals x intercepts became vertical asymptotes vertical asymptotes became x intercepts but the period did not change it just sort of moved and now now we're going to take a look at the graphs these graphs look quite similar it's almost like you phase shift and then reflect them kind of what you do and we get something about like that so we're going to fill out the domain and the range and whether it's even or odd um it's still actually going to be odd and we'll fill out the period but it's going to all that's going to happen is that these things change from where our vertical asymptote was on um on tangent to where our vertical asymptote is now for cotangent so the vertical asymptotes happen at zero we got that and at pi and negative pi and every other multiple of of pi so that means that we cannot have x values these inputs that are zero or any multiple of pi how about a range much like tangent it's all real numbers and that's due to the ratio of dividing one by some values of being very small and very small values divided by one both positive and negative we can get some of these all of these outputs from negative a to positive infinity even or odd this is still an odd graph if you think about rotating the entire function 180 degrees if you will or about the origin you're going to get that this is odd our period does not change it's still pi and even this doesn't change so we are going to notice this we are still going to get if the period is pi from zero to pi it's still the same period we're still going to get a vertical asymptote at the ends of our period we're still going to get an x-intercept at the center of our period that's that's absolutely true we're going to get negative 1 and 1 but they are reversed negative 1 is at the first quarter and sorry positive ones at the first quarter negative ones in the third quarter so i'm going to switch these and say this is for cotangent so one thing that makes it a little bit difficult is because tangent and cotangent have the same period but they don't start at the same place notice that tangent's period if you want to starts at negative pi over two and ends at pi over two but cotangent is zero to pi that's typically how we define these four inverses that we're going to talk about a little while i need you to memorize that so even though they have the same period how we're going to manipulate this next video is we're going to take a look at our key points sure we're going to take a look at hey we have a key point of negative pi over 4 or the first quarter negative one third quarter positive one for cotangent it's first quarter positive one third quarter negative one but we are going to start manipulating the period we need to understand that with tangent the original period is negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 and for cotangent it's zero to pi so make sure that we're realizing that as we get to the next video because we need to know where to start we don't start at zero like we did for sine and cosine we start at negative pi over two we kind of split we split zero with that first period for tangent cotangent does start at zero so we'll take a look at that when we get there i hope you're doing well hope you're enjoying the videos you
