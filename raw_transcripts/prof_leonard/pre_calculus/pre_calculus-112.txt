Transcript for: How to Convert From Rectangular Equations to Polar Equations (Precalculus - Trigonometry 39)
hey there welcome to another video in this video I'm going to teach you how to convert equations from rectangular equations into Polar equations so stuff with x's and y's into RS and thetas it should be a pretty fast video although I always say that and it's never ever true so it's going to be a horribly long video maybe that way it'll be actually a little bit shorter like I really intend although I want to go in depth with this stuff so you actually do understand it so what a rectangular equation refers to is an equation that be that can be graphed on an XY coordinate plane so it has x's and y's in it the two variables that represent our axes so what's a polar equation something in RS and thetas that refer to a polar coordinate system something with a polar axis and a Theta that's referring to that polar axis and a pole or Looks Like An Origin so so we're going to convert basically we're just changing x's and y's into RS and thetas now why we might want to do that is because sometimes graphing with x's and y's in rectangular coordinates are very nice works extremely well for functions really good stuff but for things that aren't functions like circles ellipses um other types of Curves like cardioids none of those are functions they can be easier to graph with polar equations and so I need to show you how to convert with that basically there's really only two things you do you find any time time that you can get an x^2 plus a y^2 replace that with R2 this is this is prime like this is what you're looking for all the time if you can find that replace that piece with r squ if not then replace any extra additional or any if you can't find this x's and y's with we've already done this haven't we this is how we converted these polar coordinates into rectangular coordinates for points and well wait if functions are just an infinite collection of points so all the points that that would graph this particular function or or nonfunction as the case may be this this curve whether polar or rectangular then wouldn't converting equations have something to do with with the converting of points we're just doing it once and for all and that's precisely what we're doing instead of converting just one point we're converting all the points of a of a function uh whether it's a polar function or whether it's rectangular coordinate function by by translating these these functions from rectangular into Polar and later on next video in from Polar to rectangular so really just two things that we do let's go through I'll walk you through maybe four examples on how we go about doing this let's take a look at 2x^2 + 2 y^2 = 3 now ultimately what we want to do to convert from rectangular to Polar is use this first use this when we can't we've already seen that when we were converting points we're just going to use it here as well so let's see if we can find x^2 + y^2 if if we can it might involve some factoring might involve combining like terms could involve adding or subtracting to both sides of an equation grouping some things but we see it right here if we have 2 x^2 + 2 y^2 and we factor out the two we're going to be left with x^2 + y^2 well this rectangular equation which is only has x's and y's there are no RS and thetas can be nicely factored to provide something that's easily translatable for us now if we do that and we notice that x^2 + y^2 is exactly what the Pythagorean theorem tells us is R 2 on a triangle or on a unit circle then we can make that substitution so ultimately look here first find as many of these as you can translate them to R squ so X s+ y^2 yeah we can substitute R 2 for that now what do you do from there solve it for R if you can and the reason why we might want to do that is because it'll be easier to see what what this actually means so if we divide both sides by two and we take a square root just like we converted our our polar equ or polar point points into our rectangular points or our coordinate systems and rectangular into Polar we kept the r positive when we convert that way we said yeah you know we could make it negative but it's easier to keep a positive R and use the angle to determine where we're at the same logic applies here whether you have a positive r or a negative R you are actually going to get the same shape here uh you're going to I won't ruin the spoiler this time uh the shape we get does not matter whether you have a positive r or negative so to keep things nice for us we're going to keep this a positive r and if we rationalize by multiplying sare root2 over < tk2 we get R = < TK 6 / 2 now what in the world is Ral < TK 6/2 well firstly does it look a little bit simpler than this maybe not if you're not used to polar equations and we haven't really grabed them yet but we will a couple more videos um if you're not really familiar that that looks simpar there's not as much junk going on but we don't really understand what it is think about what R means R is a distance from some fixed point we call it a pole Looks Like An Origin out to where the points of your function would be or or the the polar function in this case uh that that would be a constant distance there's no variable here a constant distance away from some Center Point this is giving us a circle wait a minute R stands for a radius this says your radius equals < TK 6/2 this is a circle with a radius of exactly that it's just going to give you a circle around the pole that's all that's going to happen it says whatever your Theta is there's no place to plug in Theta so whatever your Theta is anywhere around there it's going to give you a fixed distance < T 6 over2 whatever that is that is going to be a circle now does it make sense that this is also a circle do you you remember that that circles are x^2 + y^2 if you have the same coefficient we could have divided everything by two and got x^2 + y^2 = R2 this would have been if I divide by two R SAR would have been 3 over2 the square root would be < 6/2 a circle with a radius of < 6 over2 same stuff if You' ever seen conic sections I've taught it before then that gives you a circle that's kind of interesting I hope that's interesting the center would be at the origin just like this Center is at the pole th this is why it's a little bit nicer is because this acts as a function for us where this one doesn't you have to know about conic sections you don't here um this is a function in terms of polar coordinates with a polar equation so every single unique Theta is going to give you out the same radius than every single point around there is a one input gives you one output idea and that's that's very nice so this is one reason why we convert into Polar so it makes it a little bit simpler for things that are like circles and ellipses and things like that uh it's a little bit easier to graph when you get used to polar equations and polar coordinates um and when you it lets you deal with functions a little bit nicer let's move on to the next one one of the first things that we do especially when we dealing with things like x^2 + y^2 = x when we're converting from rectangular equations into Polar we are always looking for this first if you ever see x^2 + y^2 replace it with r 2 there's very few exceptions to that now what about the things that you can't replace so x to the first power or maybe you just have an X squ or Y or an extra somewhere and you can't Factor it uh this was nice because you factor out a two but let's say you couldn't factor out the two then you would have like a 2X plus just y^2 this wouldn't work so well you can't get those coefficients to be the same so you wouldn't be able to factor it if that's the case and this doesn't work for everything that you have start reverting back to your individual variables so x^2 + y^ S is r^ 2 I nailed that but with the X itself I can't wrap that up in any way shape or form with this this is the nicest one then we get a revert to here so if x is our cosine Theta which we've seen before we're just going to make that substitution so now that we've done that we've actually converted from rectangular into a polar equation but there's a little more that we can do and actually you have some options if you remember to rectangular equations like just stuff with x's and y's normally we can't really divide both sides of an equation by a variable because we start to either lose Solutions or we start to deal with some domain problems and basically the same thing happens here there there is one exception though a lot of times textbooks will tell you ignore the solution of R equals z why because then you can divide both sides by R and cancel it out so if you did that okay if if I'm allowed to Discount the solution of R equals 0 then when I divide both sides that's gone we just get rals cosine th we're going to discover in a couple more videos what that actually is the shape that that creates on the graph now what if you're not allowed to do that uh what if it doesn't say that I can ignore that well then you can do a couple other things you can get everything on one side now that's something we've seen before we've seen that a lot in fact with lots of different equations of get everything on one side and Factor we could totally do that then we'd get r^ 2 minus r cosine theta equals zero if we factor out the r we really do get to use a zero product property and create two different equations here r equal 0 or Ral cosine thet that here is exactly what we got here the only additional solution would be the the single point imagine this if you have a radius of zero it says Ah radius zero you are right at that pole it's basically the C it would be the center of a circle with no radius just a little dot that's why most textbooks would exclude that and say don't worry about that uh which allows you to divide by by R and exclude that one solution um some don't and so you'd show both of them but remember that you do have a couple options here so let's move on we've got x^2 = 4 y we're going to go through the same process that's rectangular rectangular means we'll work on a rectangular coordinate system that's x's and y's everything's in terms of x's and y's is it a function actually it is a function in terms of Y if you divide it both sides by four you would get a parabola hopefully you see that we're going to now write this in as a polar equation and see what exactly this would do so in order to do that though we're looking really at two things first look for this if you have an x^2 + y^2 anywhere you can get that make that happen first if not replace your x with r cosine Theta your y with r sin Theta I see an x s but I don't see a y^2 and I can't make it and so what happens here is we've got to replace the X with our cosine Theta and the Y with r sin Theta we've already talked a long time ago about why this works on a unit circle we're now just use it to transform translate or convert if x is R cosine Theta then x^2 is R cosine Theta quantity squar oh my goodness do not just Square this thing it happens from time to time we make little mistakes but really be conscious that X is R cosine Theta if you're squaring X you're squaring that whole thing and four four stays but why is our sin thet it's really nice if you've memorized that cosine with X and S is with Y that way these work a lot nicer when you're plugging these in you go oh yeah Y is just R and then I know Y is associated with s x is just R and well X is associated with cosine now we're going to square the r and square the cosine Theta and again you do have a couple options if R is not allowed to be zero it says just exclude that you could totally divide by by R right now and remove it from your equation you'd end up getting divide both sides by R you get R cosine you get 4 sin thet hopefully you see div by R would eliminate one of these RS one of those RS and this is what you'd end up getting if you are allowed to exclude the R equals z that's a big if what if you're not well then another thing we can do is see if we can get everything on one side and again Factor so we've just subtracted now some textbooks say that's great that's perfectly fine just leave it and you can I think that's okay if you need to go a little bit further you can Factor the r and if you see it we really do have that that two two things two equations that we could get out of this R equals 0 and this equals Z this would give us that that really non Circle sort of a point uh the radius is zero just going to give you that point along with this thing there so we could get that uh the other thing that we could do from here if you choose to do this or if you're allowed to do this you can solve for R explicitly a lot of times we like to do that so if you divide both sides by cosine s thet you could leave it like this unless you really like identities then you can you can separate that cosine squ what if you wrote this as cosine time cosine well then you have 4 sin thet over cosine Theta time cosine thet it's still cosine squ yeah this is cool because sin Theta over cosine Theta is tangent and 1 over cosine Theta is SEC Theta there's just a number of ways you can go about getting something different because of all the identities that we do have in this so I hope that makes sense ultimately honestly if as soon as we did this we converted it from rectangular into Polar that's really all that it takes simplifying from there is as a matter of how far you want to go um what's expected of you I would say minimally you would do this or divide by R if you're allowed to do that this is okay divide both sides is a little bit better use identities that's really up to you some people say that's perfectly fine because it's already in signs and cosines and we're more comfortable with those anyway for graphing so that's that's really to you um what I wouldn't do is just start dividing both sides by R if you're not explicitly told that zero is uh that R equals 0 is not allowed so I'd be I'd be very careful with that let's try a couple more so how about 2 X Y = 1 again I'm not seeing any x^2 or Y x^2 + y^2 I can't get that but every time that we can't do that just replace your x's and your y's with what they are equal to here so R cosine Theta and R sin thet so here we get 2 x is our cosine thet Y is R sin Theta equal 1 if we multiply through we're going to get an R squ remember this isn't a distribution concept you don't have to foil or anything there's no addition there's no subtraction you're just multiplying all of these factors and because we have R * R you can get R 2 that does leave us with cosine Theta sin thet = one let's go a little bit further notice there is no R over here you cannot divide by R if you do you actually lose a solution R equals z um if if it's allowed and so be cautious of that when you end up dividing by by that R you do technically have to write R equals z somewhere in there to show that you have that solution um but for here we can't do that anyway however something that we can I hope you see this if we reorder this and put the two here and the and cosine reversed so just reassociate it that is an identity and occasionally see these pop up and they're pretty nice if you have an identity in there use it that's fine this is the double angle for sign so 2 sin Theta cosine is s of 2 th I normally write the identity next that we're using but this is the identity that's exactly what it is so we get R 2 sin 2 Thal 1 a lot of times you can just leave it like this if you're required to solve for R it would take a little bit more work you'd have to divide and explicitly solve but most of the time you're okay writing that um the reason is because this does not even create a a function for R um much like y^2 would not create a function in terms of Y this would give you two outputs for every input so I'd feel comfortable just leaving that let's go into the next one so x - 3 qu^ 2 + y^2 = 9 how in the world do we deal with that I don't see anything well think about what would would happen instead of just putting in R cosine Theta for x and R sin Theta for y what would happen if were to distribute that would you end up getting at x^2 + y^2 if you do then distribute that a lot of the times we distribute first before we substitute just to make sure that we collect all of our X squ and Y squ to make them r s so I'm going to choose to distribute that that will be x^2 - 6X + 9 now we have a couple things going on firstly our nines are going to cancel If I subtract nine from both sides we're going to get zero for those constants also I'm seeing X2 and a y^2 I'm going to group those once we have grouped them every time you see X2 + y^ S replace it with r s when you're converting from rectangular to Polar that's a great thing to do so this is R 2 however this x can't be paired up like that with any other y's we don't have any other things to pair it up with anyway it's not being squared so we have to replace that x with r cosine Theta and we see something that's that's pretty common when you have these RS we saw that already you can factor that um if you added 6 R cosine Theta on both sides you could divide by it as long as you remember that you're removing a solution there um so we we want to be very careful when we're doing that so we end up getting R = 6 cosine Theta you do have this solution of Ral 0 so be cautious of that if it's not allowed you can discount it and that's just fine this is really the one that we're looking for anyway so that that's the good one um a lot of textbooks will let you leave it like this if you want to keep going this is fine there's a lot of different options really um what do I prefer it kind of kind of depends on what we're doing with it if we're graphing it that'd be a lot easier I'll tell you that we'd have a point at the center though if R is allowed to be zero so we'd have to be cautious of that uh also sometimes this is included in there somewhere so that is something where textbooks don't even care about this because it's often times included what is this anyway well this is a circle how do you know it's a circle that's a circle shifted to the right three units with a radius of three if you're familiar with your conic sections that there is a circle in rectangular coordinates that has a radius of three shifted to the right three that circle is going to come back and hit the origin that's exactly what that's giving you and so this is included there in fact if you take a look at Pi / 2 or 3 pi/ 2 you're going to hit that zero and graphically those would be the same so let's go ahead and come back with just a couple more examples and then we done okay these really will be quick I promise this time this one time um why I'm giving these to you is because you're going to find that for a lot of things like normal conic sections rectangular looks confusing and polar is nice but for a lot of rectangularly driven functions like constants like a vertical line or a horizontal line or a diagonal line like that one with the slope of square three often times they they're about the same or maybe rectangulars easier that's really easy to graph so so x = 3 is a vertical line at x = 3 y = 7 is a horizontal line at y = 7 y = > 3x is a diagonal line through the origin with a slope of theun of three can we convert them to Polar yes I'm going to show you how um sometimes that's valuable if we need to but a lot of times it kind of depends on what you're doing with it we won't want to just convert to polar equations just because if it's already kind of nice to deal with so if you have to and you don't have an x^2 + y^2 you just have X and Y convert the X with r cosine thet try to solve for R if you can so if we divide both sides by cosine Theta we end up getting R = 3 1 cosine thet is see thet now which one's nicer to graph probably that but understand this these will give you these same things so if you graph this and you graph this and superimpose the two coordinate systems so XY plane and the polar plane they're going to give you the same exact vertical line it's going to be the same um but hopefully that makes sense that some are easier depending on the context that you're that you're dealing with these in um so with lines and things like that with normal functions rectangular is nice conic sections circles ellipses these are nicer let's try yal 7 I don't see X I don't see a y^ I don't see them together all I see is a y let's replace it with r sin th and if we realize that 1/ sin thet is cose Theta this is 7 cose thet so a horizontal line of yal 7 can be graphed with a polar equation of Ral 7 cose Theta which one's nicer again that that one is if you're just going for the graph that's probably nicer but we can convert it all right let's try the last one y = < TK 3x this one's a little tricky but it's kind of fun I hope you appreciate it check this out hopefully it blows your mind what if we divided both sides by X do you remember that tangent Theta is y/x we can replace that so if we divide both sides by by X we get tangent = 3 so wait a second if tangent thet equal theun 3A is tangent inverse of thek 3 what's that mean tangent inverse of the 3 says what angle gives you out the y / x coordinates of < 3 over 1 or 32 over2 if you're looking at the unit circle that's going to be let's see pi over 3 th equal pi3 now get this that's a diagonal line what's a diagonal line do a diagonal line maintains the same slope or the same angle in relation to to that xaxis that is the angle so all this is saying is you have an equation theal 3 just go to the angle it's going to be all the points along that exact angle and that would create a diagonal line going through the origin just like that says I hope it makes sense I hope you're seeing it kind of these just for fun so that we could see how vertical horizontal and diagonal lines look in polar equations that one's actually not too bad at all kind of shows you the angle at which you draw that line so I hope I've explained it well enough what you're looking for when to use the appropriate thing and how and when you can simplify especially factoring r or if you're allowed to divide by R if R equals z is not allowed as a solution if it is then you have to show it hopefully makes sense next video we're going to come back and I'm going to talk about how to convert from polar equations back to rectangular have a great day
