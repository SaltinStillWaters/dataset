Transcript for: Trigonometric Functions and the Unit Circle (Precalculus - Trigonometry 6)
welcome to another video so in this video we're going to start talking about trigonometric functions exactly what this class is pretty much all about most times call them trig functions because trigonometric just takes so darn long to say so we're going to study trig functions and where exactly they come from i'm going to show you two different approaches the reason why i'm going to do that and not just talk about the unit circle is because at this point most people have seen like a right triangle trigonometry at some point in like a geometry class or something like that so i'm gonna i'm gonna relate these two so that you know they're talking about the same thing and why they're talking about the same thing and why sine cosine tangent cosecant secant and cotangent work uh how they actually work to represent the same angle depending on the relationship of our sides so we'll talk about that of a right triangle uh we'll talk about that i'll discuss what a unit circle is i will go in length about what that what that does we'll talk about defining some quadrant angles and then what we're going to talk about is how to deal with the unit circle and how to use it in the next video so let's get right into it when we talk about a trigonometric function there's two real ways to think about this one that's defined on unit circle and one that relates to a right triangle so here's one way to think about what a trig function does what a trig function does is it relates an angle to two sides of a right triangle so what what's that mean depending on what angle you're talking about typically one of our acute angles here not generally the 90 degree angle but on a right triangle with one 90 degree angle if we can somehow create this relationship from an angle and two sides that relationship is what's called the trigonometric function and there's a certain way to do it usually people have seen like sine cosine tangent so i want to explore this for a little bit we're not going to go very deep into this right now what's going to happen is i'm showing you this now so you'll be able to see it on a circle so we'll make that connection now and in many many videos from now i'm going to show you these relationships on a right triangle again and say you remember that one time so here's that one time that one time is if we can define the way an angle relates to two sides on a right triangle it will not change if we make that triangle larger same scale but larger that's called similar triangles so through similar triangles we can prove that it does not matter the size of the sides it's the ratio between them that that matters and that relates to an angle that is unchanging i'm going to show you that to you in a minute so let's discuss a little bit maybe it's review for you maybe it's brand new it's okay i just want to get in your head right now what sine cosine and tangent are for an angle on a right triangle remember sine can't equal anything this makes sense and cosine can't equal anything tangent can't equal anything it's a way to relate an angle to two sides so you need three things in every trig function an angle and two sides when we're talking about a right triangle here's how it works so if we talk about sine of an angle what sine typically does is relates an opposite to a hypotenuse side on a right triangle so for us that would be this a that's the opposite to the angle i'm talking about you draw a straight line through that's opposite and that's the hypotenuse you might remember the hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle it's also opposite 90 degrees remember i'm not trying to teach this to you perfectly right now just to give you a reference point so sine for us would be a over c cosine for that same angle we're talking about angle a or that theta right there relates the adjacent side over the hypotenuse namely b over c that's typically how we'd like to see cosine now tangent tangent relates the opposite over the adjacent now i want you to notice something very clear that it's going to show up on our unit circle if i relate tangent of whatever angle i have to the opposite over adjacent that's a over b but it's also true that it's sine divided by cosine take these two things a over c divided by b over c and notice with your complex fraction your c's will cancel you will end up getting a over b we're going to see that bear out right now we're going to see that sine relates to this opposite idea well opposite is a vertical idea a think of it like a y-axis idea or along the y-axis over the hypotenuse while a unit circle or hypotenuse is going to be one cosine cosine is an x-idea look at the x-axis here cosine is an x idea over hypotenuse with the hypotenuse is 1. tangent relates the two tangent takes r y and divides by our x or our sine and divides by our cosine we're going to see that now some students really don't grasp that some students think sine is some magic number it's not it's a relationship between an angle that creates a ratio of sides so it's cosines those tangent so here's what i want you to think about imagine if we made this bigger so just a bigger triangle now it's still a right triangle but i want you to kind of ignore this don't think about that anymore and let's think about this side as f over g here's what i want you to notice look at the big triangle and remember the small triangle are these two triangles similar similar what similar means is just a bigger shape at the same angle so same shape blown up just made bigger um it's not like it's sort of close it's exactly the same shape just larger in similar shapes our sides are still proportional here's what that means a divided by b is exactly the same fraction as f divided by g that's a true statement notice how when i make my triangle bigger that angle does not change at all so it doesn't matter how large or how small your triangle is sine and cosine and tangent of one angle is always going to be the same it's very predictable it's very very repeatable and all it does is relates an opposite to a hypotenuse side that hypotenuse is growing also but the relationship between a and c and f and h are exactly the same this is why we're able to use sine of say 30 degrees and it's always the same no matter whether we're talking about a huge triangle or a small triangle no matter we're talking about something with a radius of 50 or something with a radius of one it doesn't matter so if it doesn't matter what size our circle is or a triangle is if a sine and cosine and tangent of all these trig functions of one particular angle do not change because it's based on the relationship of one side to another that in proportionality of similar triangles goes with the same rate that's a lot of words then why don't we just make it easy and use a radius of one or a hypotenuse of one and make all of these things nice that's what we're about to do right now we're going to jump into the unit circle but i wanted you to see this i wanted to see that i don't care how big or small my sides are sine of a particular angle is always the same ratio a over b is a ratio just as f over g is or in the case of sine a over c is a ratio just like f over h is they are identical tangent would have been a over b compared to f over g that ratio is always in proportion because we have these similar shapes for a particular angle that we're given that's why sine cosine tangent and all the trig functions the reciprocals do not change based on the fact of how big your triangle is because if that angle doesn't change they're always in the same proportion and that's that's magic that's a beautiful thing so what we're going to do now is we take that that idea kind of put it put in the bank for just a second we're going to take a look at what is called the unit circle it's a different way to approach what sine cosine and tangent are defined as but you're going to see that they're very strongly related because you can make a right triangle i'm going to show that to you so what a unit circle is it's just a circle with a radius of one so you can see that right here so if we have this superimposed on the x y axis then there'd be a point where my circle intersects my x-axis at one comma zero this would be x equals one and y equals zero and zero one and negative one zero and zero negative one now here's the idea if we start taking an arc length of t starting with remember our initial side typically goes it's typically at this zero one oh sorry a 1 0 on this positive x axis and we start giving a positive arc length for counterclockwise and a negative arc length for clockwise we start getting these points on this circle let's call that arc length t in a moment we're going to use t to replace the s for our plane from that formula we're going to see something very very neat about it well there's a couple things that we need to understand about this number number one is that arc length like angles are measured counterclockwise positive clockwise negative arc length for a unique arc length it will define a unique point on your circle on that unit circle it will also define a unique angle we call that a central angle so that's what we have here so arc length is t great it's positive for counterclockwise awesome it's negative for clockwise good deal and each t creates a unique point we denote that x and y because we really do have an x axis and a y-axis here denotes a unique point on that unit circle it also denotes a unique central angle here which is quite interesting so can you see it can you see how if my arc length is t great if it's t and a little bit it'd be a different point t and less a little bit it'd be a different point and it'd also be a different angle you should see that so what we're trying to do right now we're trying to relate a few things we're trying to relate that every point on the circle has a radius of one of course the unit circle it has a unique angle and a unique arc length and we're about to define some trigonometric functions based on that now let's go a little further and let's really take a look at arc length if you remember arc length is s and it's equal to the radius times the angle the central angle the angle that sweeps out that particular arc length and it's always in terms of radians you need to remember y remember there's really a hidden over radiance there and so we had to have that so that length made length and not length over radians or something and so there's a hidden thing in here that says you have to have radians well let's take care of this let's say that okay if s is our arc length but wait a minute we're calling our blank t let's change this just a little bit our arc length in this case is whatever t is it's creating a unique point on the unit circle and unique central angle positive for counterclockwise negative or clockwise we're going to call it t so because t is our arc length we can do that our arc length is equal to r times theta no problem that makes sense well what's what's our theta our theta is our central angle so that's fantastic we know that every arc length creates that unique central angle for every unique arc length but wait if this is a unit circle our radius is 1 would that be true at every point along the circle well yeah of course that's exactly what a radius means is that that that radius is always one and so for every value of t every particular unique arc length for every particular unique central angle that sweeps out that arc length our radius is one so and this is what we learned a little while ago is that if your radius is one your arc length numerically is the same thing as your central angle so if it's remember this is only in radians it only works for radians so you got to get that but for your radians numerically your arc length is equal to your angle why is that the case numerically because one's length right and one is is radians well it's because right here this radius has a length to it and it's over radiant so when you multiply it by an angle that's units is in radians it cancels gives you numerically length equals length and that's what that says to us so if we disregard the units you're on a unit circle your arc length is equal to your central angle that should fascinate you like wow that's that's kind of interesting and what that does is that allows us to define our trigonometric function sine cosine tangent cosecant secant and cotangent as either along an arc length or a central angle now listen very clearly care for this next thing if your radius is not one then your central angle no longer equals your arc length and your trigonometry functions are no longer defined as just equal to that arc length uh or using that arc length because that's based on a unit circle i hope that makes sense to you that's pretty important one more thing i'm going to write just make sure that you're using radians here so here's what trig functions are going to do for us they're going to relate either the arc length or the central angle to the point on the unit circle remember that that circle is only the unit circle so let's let's really go through this one more time just to make sure that we're all okay and then we're going to talk about sine and cosine tangent cosecant secant cotangent here's one way to look at it one way to look at trig functions is relating an angle to a pair of sides depending on what pair we're comparing we get sine cosine tangent or the reciprocals of those things that i have not shown on the board the reason why i'm showing you this is will be apparent in just a minute but the reason why i want to make sure you understand this is because no matter how big or small our triangle is if that angle doesn't change the proportion between the sides that are being compared will also not change that means it's predictable repeatable and it's a single value sine of an angle is always the same for whatever that angle is that's important i need to understand that also no matter what your hypotenuse is all right it doesn't have to be one be anything now when it is one we get something very specific but that's where these trig functions that's what these trig functions are relating to as far as a right triangle is concerned now we took a look at a different look at and said if we had some sort of a arc length which sweeps out some central angle and our radius is one well there's some very interesting things we can do with this we measure arc length the same as we measure angles positive or counterclockwise well if our t is our arc length and our radius is one then numerically our arc length is equal to our our central angle but only on a unit circle because that's the only time that our radius is actually one other than that well we can't really say that those are the same that's why we had a formula for arc length uh that depended on the radius and so that that matters it's important and so what this is going to ultimately do is relate the arc length and central angle which is identical on a unit circle to some point on that particular circle and that's what trig functions do okay so let's take a look at this what i've done is i've written some abbreviations for sine looks like sin don't worry i have anything wrong to sine cosine tangent cosecant secant and cotangent i've related them in such a way that hopefully it'll be apparent to you that these things are reciprocals so sine and cosecant cosine secant tangent and cotangent are going to be reciprocals of one another and we're going to see that in just a bit so let's discover what these things are as defined by the unit circle and then how it relates to what i've shown in the beginning we've come full circle on this thing now here's how this is defined you'll notice also that sine of t and sine of theta what's the difference there is no difference when we're starting to relate r2 sides or point on the unit circle there's no difference between those but keep in mind that the only time that the arc length is defined like this easily is when we're using that unit circle and so our radius would have to be one so we can define this with real numbers we can also define this with central angles and that works works both ways usually we use them interchangeably so we we can deal with sign and understand what it is based on that unit circle so here's what it is as we're defining it by the unit circle sine of t or sine of theta is going to be equal to y y why what what is y y is this y coordinate of your point which is actually quite fascinating really when you think about it so if i sweep out an angle or take a certain arc length on a circle with a radius of 1 it's going to give me some point on that circle that point is going to have a coordinate x and a coordinate for y sine of my angle or arc length for that particular point is actually equal to the y the y coordinate numerically that value now why in the world is that if you've never seen this before this is why i showed you this part check this out let's just pretend that we drop a perpendicular right here now wait a second that creates for us some x and some y value along the x axis and y axis for this right triangle hopefully you see the right triangle how points work on a rectangular coordinate system is that this height is our y and this distance right here is our x notice how y goes all the way up to the circle the x it does not why not because we're shifting along that so check it out if i wanted to take sine of whatever this angle is notice sine when relating it to triangles works with the angle the angle not the arc length because this does not have to have a radius of one and that's what i was just saying a little while earlier so if this is related to this angle then what would sine be according to this angle well it would be opposite over hypotenuse but y over 1 is just y that is how this relates to right triangle trigonometry we're going to see that in many more videos i'm going to relate this back again and say okay now that we understand this now we're going to talk about right triangle trigonometry so this really should be y over 1 and y over 1. that's exactly what this would be because based on that right triangle would be opposite over hypotenuse but the hypotenuse on your circle is one that's pretty neat so how about cosine cosine is going to be x [Music] y x well for the same reason notice how this point has a distance over on the x axis along with the distance up on the y that's how we're taking it the rectangular coordinate system works and so according this central angle notice i'm relating to the central angle when i'm doing this again because as far as arc length it doesn't really work on the right triangle but it would work here so by the central angle we would get x that's the adjacent over the hypotenuse but the hypotenuse is one so really it's x over one but x over one is always equal to x lastly we're going to get that tangent t and tangent of theta is y over x and so that makes it really easy to see that tangent theta is equal to sine of whatever it is theta over t sine of theta over cosine theta so we can see right here if tangent theta is y over x hey sine theta is y cosine theta is x we can also define it that way or tangent t equals sine t over cosine t so now it's time to move on and talk about what we call reciprocal functions of sine cosine and tangent and they're very strongly related obviously because they're they are just reciprocals and so what we're going to do is take a look at cosecant secant and cotangent as reciprocals of sine cosine and tangent respectively now i'm not going to go back to the the triangle to really do that we're just going to define them right now based on our original three trig functions so if we take a look at cosecant of t and cosecant of theta those are reciprocals of sine t and sine of theta well i guess that i am going to go back there a little bit so if they're reciprocals well we have to have a fraction well if it's a reciprocal of sine t which is y well what's under the y well it would be one wait a minute opposite over hypotenuse that is our hypotenuse and so what cosecant does is takes hypotenuse over opposite instead of opposite over hypotenuse on a right triangle but also on our unit circle so we're going to define this as 1 over y and likewise secant is the reciprocal of cosine for either t or theta whatever arc length on a unit circle or central angle we have and that would be 1 over x cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent that would be x over y which relates to adjacent over opposite we're going to find some really interesting things about co-relationships in trig functions so sine and cosine tangent and cotangent and what they actually mean when we get there so that's that's really it that that is what trigonometry comes from uh what what these well at least trigonometric functions come from is either from considering an angle relating to two sides that's three parts an angle and two sides or an angle or arc length and two sides of a right triangle that creates this point on a unit circle with a radius of one creates a very very nice succinct definitions for us for sine cosine tangent and the reciprocal functions of cosine sorry cosecant secant and cotangent respectively i hope i've made it made sense i hope i've made some connections for you that you might not ever see before i really hope that you understood the similarity idea so making larger similar triangles has the same proportion and therefore the sine cosine tangent the trigonometry of an angle that's not changing will not change either it's it's constant for a particular angle it's very interesting hopefully i made it relate to hey you can't build a right triangle so they are related but if we have a unit circle central angle equals arc length four radians not degrees four radians like we talked about and then we can relate that to any point on that circle for a unique central angle unique arc length and then we have some trig functions from that so we're going to come back we're going to find some quadrant angles then what we're going to do is we'll also talk about what if we don't have quadrant angles and it will lead us onto something called the unit circle where we have all of these very common degrees and radians filled out i'll show you how to use in the next video let's start using the unit circle to figure out some trigonometric relationships between central angles or we can think arc length since this is a unit circle and some measurements of those central angles with the the coordinates x and y so we're going to do that it's going to lead us into how to use a unit circle and i've developed one for you well i haven't developed it i drew a nice big one then i'm going to show you on the next video on exactly how to use it this is just the jumping off point so it seems fair enough to start figuring out our trig functions as it relates to just our quadrant angles if you remember quadrant angles that's 0 90 180 270 360 degrees respectively or 0 pi over 2 pi 3 pi over 2 and 2 pi radians if we're talking radians and that's what we're going to deal with here i'm going to reference degrees as we're going through this but actually right now zero radians is zero degrees pi over two remember that that is 90 degrees i'm not drawing so that you'll start remembering it i don't want to have to always have out that sheet of paper as a crutch so you know that's 90 degrees or pi over 2. 180 degrees or pi 270 degrees or 3 pi over 2 and then 360 degrees or 2 pi and so we're going to find the quadrant angles for those things notice i'm not going to be doing what are called coterminal angles i'm not going to deal with positive 90 and negative 270 because those will have exactly the same point x is 0 y is 1. so there's no need to do that we can define them one way and get exactly what that the sign of that angle is whether it's positive or negatively defined and so we're going to start doing this right now so sine of zero remember sine always deals with the y coordinate of whatever point that angle is referencing on your unit circle so if we have sine of zero that's going to be a point one zero well the y coordinate is zero sine of zero is zero cosine represents is represented by the x-coordinate that's how we define that remember i spent the whole long time in this video explaining where that all came from so that and where this stuff came from so that we can just use it now i'm not going to re-explain it all the time so our x coordinate is 1 so cosine of 0 is the x coordinate 1. tangent divides those two so tangent is 0 divided by 1 y divided by x that would be zero the other three take these and reciprocate them so notice that tangent because it divides and sometimes we divide by zero there cosecant secant and cotangent will be undefined at some values some angles some arc lengths sine and cosine will not sine and cosine are defined everywhere we get a graph of that you might have heard of a sine curve it just keeps on going and going and going between two values what two values negative one and one why get this because this is our y-axis and sine is the y-coordinate the range is negative one to one the range of a sine curve is negative one to one it can't get outside of that so it goes just like that same thing with cosine cosine is defined by x what's the domain negative one to one of this of this non-function if we want to call it domain but the x coordinate let's say ranges so the interval goes from negative one to one cosine can only give you out negative one to one that's exactly how this relates to that graph we're going to talk about that when we get graphs of trig functions so anyway back to this as a long story for a kind of cool thing but what that means is that cosine and sine are going to be defined everywhere but the rest of them won't you're going to have something that's undefined and get the first one right here and so we see that we see that sine was zero over one remember our angle would have an initial terminal side right here that would be a y coordinate over the radius well that's zero over one if i reciprocate it as one over zero this is undefined well cosine is one over one why because that would be x coordinate right here remember this angle this is just an example this would be right here one divided by one that would be adjacent over hypotenuse would be one reciprocated i still get one but cotangent is zero over one if i reciprocate that i get one over zero that's undefined now let's go on we're going to do this very quickly there's a lot of them to do hopefully you can go through right now and just pick out them the ones that match up to our x and y and get the rest of them from it that's why i do it so if i talk about sine of pi over 2 pi over 2 is right here remember this was just an example we're not really looking at that right now we're thinking quadrant angles so if i think of quadrant angle at 90 degrees or pi over two my y coordinate would be one my x would be zero so sine of pi over two is one and cosine pi over two is zero tangent divides those 1 divided by 0 is undefined cosecant of pi over 2 would take 1 over 1 and reciprocate it it would give you 1. but cosine of 0 well this is 0 over 1. if i reciprocate that i get undefined now this is very interesting so notice that cotangent of pi over two is not undefined why not well it takes x and divides by y zero divided by one is zero i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing the interplay there i would strongly encourage you to go through and do the same thing with pi that's 180 degrees then 3 pi over 2 that's 270 degrees and see what you get of course i'm going to do it right now how i always start these is i start by identifying the sine and cosine they're the easiest i divide them to get tangent and i consider what's next for my reciprocal functions so sine of pi sine is y so i'm going to go over here and say sine of pi is zero cosine pi that's the x is negative one tangent divides them zero divided by negative one uh y divided by x sine divided by cosine gives you zero okay cosecant would take zero over one and reciprocate it that's one over zero that's undefined negative one over one reciprocated is still negative one zero over one reciprocated is one over zero that's undefined hopefully you're noticing some of the things that are happening i want you to see this really see it see how our sine our sine is all positive for these two quadrants why sine relates to y why outputs are positive for all of these points all of the points up there are above the x-axis they're all positive but our cosine changes signs right here x remember cosine is x x is positive here and so cosine of any of these angles is positive until i get to here now x changes to negative so cosine for any of these angles is going to be negative i hope you're seeing that tangent relates the two divides positive by positive or positive by negative in these two quadrants and so we're going to get some sign changes we're going to learn about this in the next video about you might have heard all students take calculus or some variation of that all sine tangent and cosine for what is positive in those quadrants interesting so the last one sine of three pi over two remember sine is y so it's negative one and zero for x tangent divides and that's undefined and i want you to see that for both this quadrant angle of pi over two and this quadratic angle of three pi over two uh right here we get undefined now we reciprocate so negative one over one is still negative one zero over one becomes undefined but 1 over negative 1 over 0. so remember that's what happened here we took y over x negative 1 over 0 becomes 0 over negative 1. well that's zero and that is defined notice how cotangent is defined for both pi over two and three pi over two so this is saying something to us there's something called a period uh for these trig functions they repeat every so often we're going to really study that as we get into the graphs of trigonometry but i want you to see it now so you start building toward that like there's this portion of the x-axis on which these trig functions will repeat in fact for cosine and sine they're going to start repeating after you get back to here aren't they so they're going to repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat every time you make a full rotation that's a period here well tangent is a little quicker than that it's going to be every 2 pi over 2 every 90 degrees it's going to throw every pot it's going to repeat so every little portion these things have that that repetition so i hope that makes sense to you we're going to do one more and then we're going to call it good for the video so last one is what would happen if you were given a point could you from a point that's on you in a circle and you can verify this with uh with what is called the pythagorean theorem you can say this squared plus this squared equals radius squared you're going to get one and so if that's one then that point is on that unit circle would have a radius of one so it's very easy to verify that that point is going to be right about here from that point could we determine based on the angle it swept out what sine cosine tangent and their reciprocal cosecant secant and cotangent are based on that point notice this is in quadrant two so i want you to think about this in quadrant two please get this in quadrant two the x values are negative the y values are positive that means sine has to be positive here cosine has to be negative here tangent has to be negative here because it divides a positive by a negative we're going to see that right now so if we think about sine of theta the angle that creates this point this unique point on the unit circle sine theta is going to be the y value it's simply three pi sorry square root of three over two cosine is the x value negative one half notice how sine is positive and cosine is negative for that particular central angle because that is in quadrant two y's have to be positive there x's are negative tangent divides them and this is where it gets a little more difficult because you actually do have to divide it tangent divides sine over cosine for that particular angle or y over x for that particular point that's going to be negative square root of 3. so we can think of this divided by one-half well if i divide by one-half i can reciprocate and multiply 2's cancel but i do get a negative square root of 3. and now we're going to go ahead and do the rest of them so notice that when we reciprocate things with square roots we're going to have to rationalize the denominator a lot of the times also notice that i'm really getting my my only two i'm only really getting two from a given circle i'm using those two to develop my tangent much like i did here i'm using those three to get my co my uh my reciprocal functions out of that i'm not going back to my unit circle very often so cosecant is the reciprocal of sine relate that in your head so if i reciprocate that i'm going to get 2 over square root of 3. you'll often see this as two root three over three how about secant secant is kind of nice secant is the reciprocal of negative one-half that's negative two notice how your signs do not change which gives you the same sort of signed quadrants for cosecant as sine and secant as cosine and cotangent as tangent because it's dividing the same signs there or look at the same signs but reciprocate them signs don't change with reciprocation and now we're going to take negative root 3 over 1 and reciprocate that 1 over root negative root 3. if we if we multiply or rationalize the denominator by square root of three over square root of three we're gonna get negative square root of three over three i hope that makes sense i hope that you've seen that we can use the unit circle to find sine cosine tangent of whatever central angle gives us that unique point on our our unit circle we're going to look at a much more robust unit circle next time that has some very very common values of of our central angle and our points that relate to those central angles we'll look at like 0 pi over 6 pi over 4 pi over 3 pi over 2 and every one of those intervals around that unit circle and it's going to be very useful so that's uh that's 30 45 60 and 90 degrees and every multiple of those things around a unit circle notice i'm not going to give you more than one rotation because it starts over and that's that's that's great you can count that far but you're going to get the same points if we go more than one rotation so one rotation on a unit circle gives you a unique set of points and unique central angles that create those points so we'll talk about that i hope it's made sense i hope that i've given you a very good outline of where this unit circle comes from where trigonometric functions come from and how they relate both to a right triangle that we've built on this and to the unit circle which makes it a lot nicer so i hope it's made sense i hope you're doing well i'll see you for another video soon you
