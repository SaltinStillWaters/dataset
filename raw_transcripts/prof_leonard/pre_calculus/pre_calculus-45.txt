Transcript for: Inequalities with Functions - Graphically (Precalculus - College Algebra 45)
hey there welcome to another video in this video and the next two videos we're going to start dealing with functions and inequalities together so inequalities that involve functions and before we unpack algebraically how to deal with polynomials and rationals that's next two videos in inequalities we're going to get graphically what exactly it is that we're doing so just a few quick examples on how we determine when a function is greater than greater than equal to less than less than equal to zero so basically how we compare a function to the x-axis not too bad there's just one thing that we need to understand when they're asking you where a function is greater than or equal to zero less than or equal to 0 these are always asking and maybe more appropriately worded this on what portion of the x-axis is your function less than 0 or on what portion of your x-axis are your outputs below the x-axis so where's your graph below sorry below the x-axis or above the x-axis on what portion of the x-axis is your function above it or below it that's what these are asking so that's what i'm going to show you it's all about the x-axis so we're not doing this so much as we're doing this so along the x-axis i'm going to show you that i'm going to model that for you on four examples some involving some polynomials and some involving some rationals as we see asymptotes up there so again here's the question so what this asks is according to your graph of your function i want to find the portion of your x-axis where the function is greater than or equal to zero that's where the function is above the x-axis or on the x-axis and so really we just go from left to right and we ask on what portions of this x-axis am i above it well when we start out we're above the x-axis here so for this portion all the way from negative infinity to zero my graph is above or my outputs are greater than zero my graph is above the x-axis and how we would show that is with interval notation we'd say hey for this part of the x-axis negative infinity all the way to zero my function is above the x or my in my outputs are greater than or equal to zero all the way up to and including 0. now we always have this question when do we use a bracket when we use a parenthesis if you have an equal sign in general we use a bracket the only time we don't do that is if you're asked to find something equal to a point that does not exist so open circle or asymptote we're going to see it a little bit so one segment is okay from negative infinity to zero hey my graphs above the x how about from zero to one well no no my outputs are below zero my function is below the x-axis that doesn't qualify here so the same i want the graph to be above the x-axis the other interval is right here so from one to two and so we'd say there's another one where my function is above 0 where my graph is above the x-axis and the portion of the x-axis where my graph is above it is also 1 to 2. but we're going to say above it or on it and that's what the equal says it says this function is above the x-axis from one to two it's on the x-axis at one and at x equals two and that's what we're talking about here we're saying my graph is above the x-axis from negative infinity all the way to zero on the x-axis at zero and then again it's on the x-axis on this x-axis equal to zero my output is zero at x equals one and then all the way to two and including two and that's the way that we we do this that's what an inequality is asking you for as it relates to a function and zero or some constant above or equal to where i'm below and vice vice versa so how about where's the function below zero same question just for looking below the x-axis the more appropriate wording for this in english would be on what portion of the x-axis is your function below the x-axis so on the x what interval of x is my function below it or on what interval of the x-axis are my outputs negative less than zero well that would be not here all my outputs are positive here my outputs are negative from here to here all my elements are negative and from here onward all my outputs are negative and that's what we would write those two intervals are from zero to one from zero to one all my outputs are negative they're down below the x-axis the functions below x and then again from 2 to infinity we just have to use the appropriate symbols in interval notation when you don't get to include the points that are on the x-axis and that's what this is saying it's saying i want outputs that are strictly below zero not equal to zero strictly blue strictly negative strictly below the x-axis so that would say yeah it's zero but not including the zero not including the zero says you could do like .000001 and if you plug that into this function .0001 it would give you a negative output we're just not allowed to include the point x equals 0 because that's on the x-axis for us so we don't include it we show that with the parentheses same thing for one we're below the x-axis at every value between zero and one but not at zero and one parentheses allows us to do that it says i'm below the x-axis or have an output that's negative from zero to one or between zero and one but just not including them same thing here i am below zero i have an output that's below zero at every input from 2 to infinity just not including the two and so we show that with the parentheses that's about all there is to it we just need to get down kind of the english interpretation of what this means or some sort of a mental picture of what this means when you're asked to find function below zero it what it's saying is what portion the x-axis what are the inputs that are causing your outputs to be greater than or equal to zero so positive or on the x-axis what are your out what are the inputs that are causing your output to be less than zero so below the x-axis let's try a couple more so on the next one we kind of reverse this we say hey can you find the function that's greater than zero without being equal to zero so what this is in english is find me the portion of the x-axis where my outputs are strictly positive or where my graph is above the x-axis that's what it says but not on it so we look at our our graph and we go okay hey my graph is above the x-axis right here and then right here notice i'm not doing this i'm doing this i'm going along the x-axis why well because of the way that we organize our functions x is the independent variable it's what drives the function it's what you get to plug into and then your outputs f depends on that so we can organize our thoughts in such a way to say this portion of my inputs causes my outputs to be positive so it's asking you what are your inputs that are causing these outputs to be positive well those inputs would be negative 1 to 1. this is where my graph is above the x-axis and then again so above between here and here and then above from 2 onward we always use parentheses for infinities because we can't actually get there no matter what we saw that over here that had to be a parenthesis because you can't really include negative infinity it's impossible to actually get there so we always do that but then we look here and we say you know what i'm not asking for the values of x where my graph is on the x-axis where my output is equal to zero i'm saying i want to strictly pause it strictly above that well that would be between negative 1 and 1 but not including them and that would be from 2 to infinity but not including it so i guess a long story made short as if you have an equals you use a bracket for points that are on the x axis and if not you don't next one down here that's f of x is less than or equal to zero kind of the opposite idea this is asking the english where is your function below the x-axis or in other words on what portion of your x-axis is your graph below it or does your graph have negative outputs or zero outputs on the x-axis or below it so we look at it and go well i know my graph is below the x-axis right here and right here on the on the x-axis what that means is inputs from negative infinity to negative one cause me negative outputs inputs from negative infinity to negative one are going to cause me to have this graph below the x-axis since this is also asking you for where is your output equal to zero where is your output on the x-axis we get to include that input we get to include negative 1 saying hey every single value from negative infinity up to negative 1 up to negative 1 is going to give me a negative output it's going to give me something below the x axis at negative 1 itself it'll give me something on the x-axis and that's included here that says okay that includes the output of zero that's fine that's why we include that value if that hadn't been there we would have to do a parenthesis because that wouldn't be included the other interval that we see is i want my graph below or equal to x axis that's from one to two the the inputs from one to two give me outputs that are negative below the x-axis at one and two themselves those inputs of one and two x equals one x equals two give me an output that is zero it is an x-intercept it's saying that's allowed here i want the outputs that are less than sort of negative or below or equal to or on the x-axis and that's exactly how we do these for polynomials it should make sense that where we're not above the x-axis or equal to the x-axis we're below it and vice versa for polynomials they are continuous they don't have any jumps gaps support really any constants for any length of time besides our horizontal functions like y equals constant okay let's move on just a little bit so what about if we have some rational functions we treat them the same but they can be a little bit more confusing as far as interval notation is concerned because we have some asymptotes and if we ask where are we below or equal that can be a little confusing so we'll talk about that again the key here is just what portion of the x-axis is causing outputs that do this or outputs that do that so let's ask the first question on what portion of the x-axis are my outputs strictly negative not on the x but below the x well let's think about it from here to here my graph is above the x-axis so those are all positive outputs from here to here oh hey my output is negative so that's that's one interval where we're below the x-axis or have negative outputs here we have positive and here we have negative for the entirety of this interval so the interval for where my function is below the x or has negative outputs those inputs are from negative 2 all the way to 0 then again from 2 to infinity now we'll talk about the parentheses and the brackets right now so if this as asking you what portion of the x-axis gives you outputs that are strictly negative we don't get to include a zero we're saying i want something that's strictly negative below zero or below the x-axis that means that from negative two to zero well i'm not gonna include the negative two ever no matter what why well negative 2 is undefined negative 2 is a vertical asymptote there's not even a point there so even if we had an equals here we wouldn't be able to include that we'd have to use a parenthesis because that point at negative 2 does not have an output that input does not have an output so we're going to use parentheses here no matter what really we'll see that right down here but at 0 because i want something strictly less than it i can't include the 0. like negative 0.0001 that would be fine that would give me a negative value that's okay but at zero that's on the x i can't include it likewise at two we don't we have another vertical asymptote we can't include that and this says all the inputs from negative two to zero not including zero are going to give me a negative output that's what it's asking for all the inputs from two to infinity not including the two are going to give me a negative output the other one if we talk about hey where's my function greater than or equal to zero it's kind of just the opposite just be very careful with uh with your brackets here we're gonna discuss that for just a minute so where we're looking at the the x-axis where our graph is above it well our graph is above the x-axis or has positive outputs from negative infinity to negative two and then again from zero to that's where my graph is above the x or has positive outputs i'm gonna put those intervals down so negative infinity to negative two and then again zero to two just keep in mind we sometimes get in such a like a zone of thinking equal sign means brackets let's put brackets everywhere well that's true for the zero that's okay but it's not true for the negative two and the two and here's why if we're looking for the function is greater than or equal to zero that means that our outputs are positive or on the x-axis here all of our outputs are positive they're not equal to zero and there's no point at negative two so if there's no point in negative two you can't even plug it in to say whether it's positive or zero it's undefined that's what a vertical asymptote means we can't even do anything with that for that reason because we never actually get to the negative two there's no point there at all we cannot include it even though there's an equals there you can't even plug it in i hope that makes sense like that's what a vertical asymptote meant right is that you had a denominator that was equal to zero and you could not plug that value in because you get something that's undefined well that's what's going on here negative 2 is an undefined input and therefore can't have an output well you can't have an output you can't say whether it's positive or zero and therefore we leave it as an open parenthesis because you can't ever retain that input to plug in the other one in this interval we say we want our outputs to be 0 or higher than that 0 is included that's ok so 0 because it's an x-intercept and we're allowing that we're allowing our output to be zero that is an x-intercept we're going to include that value we certainly do not include the two for the same reasons i talked about here it's a vertical asymptote you can't actually get there and those are the intervals for where our functions below the x-axis or above the x-axis or on the x-axis okay let's talk about our last one very very similar concept at this point you really should pause the video and try it just see if you can identify the intervals where we're above zero and below zero it is a little bit challenging because we have a horizontal asymptote which kind of makes us want to do it different intervals than we should keep in mind this is your x-axis not this one so in the first example i am asking for on what portion of the x-axis is my function strictly positive are my outputs strictly positive is my graph above the x-axis that's the three ways that we can interpret that well this is not the x-axis this is so where i'm above the x-axis well my graph is positive from here to here and then again notice how i pause there's no point here from here to here and then again from here not to here from here to here my graph is positive above the x-axis it does not happen again it's negative from here to here and then a positive again from here to here i misspoke it doesn't happen from here to here it happens again from here here that's still positive that's above the x-axis so when we take a look at it i'm thinking on what section or portion interval with the x-axis my graph positive or above it that's negative infinity to negative 2. now why we have to stop why we can't keep going is because if you have a missing point somewhere even if it's undefined you can't include it in an interval because that would suggest that your graph is above the x-axis at that value and it's not there is no point there so we'd say that this is above the x-axis x-axis above above above but then right here we get the pause there is no point but then right past that right at negative 1.99999 and then forever so just right up to negative 2 and you show the negative 2. remember what parentheses do they say right at that value just past it so you put the negative 2 even though there's no value there the bracket would include the value the parentheses does not it says we can go from negative infinity to negative 2 but not including it that's like negative two point zero zero zero for a really long way and then a one all of those inputs will give us outputs that are positive and then again from negative two just past that so negative one point nine nine nine i'm really really close to it and then all the way let's see the portion of my x-axis here causes positive outputs from here all the way to two now this is asking you for things that are above the x-axis and not on it there's no equals there so i have to disinclude that two with the parentheses because i'm not asking for x-intercepts i'm asking for strictly positive strictly above the x-axis now from the 2 to the 4 i'm negative for sure and that's a vertical asymptote from the 4 to the 6 i've negative for sure but we do cross it again so from 6 onward it's always going to give us positive positive outputs there from so from 6 to positive infinity but since we're not including x-intercepts we have to not include that 6. those would be the intervals of the x-axis that cause our function to be above the x or have positive outputs and not zero the below honestly it's a little bit easier because there's only two little little intervals that have a function value that is negative and that would be from two to four so here's our x-axis from two to four then again from 4 to 6 but just not including that 4 that 4 is again undefined point you cannot include it so we want inputs that cause negative outputs outputs that are less than zero or equal to zero that's x-intercepts so we want inputs that cause negative values or x-intercepts negative sorry positive two right at that x value that is an x intercept so we're going to include that because worst bracket ever because x intercepts are allowed to be included so we're saying that input causes an x-intercept great that's allowed every input from two to four is causing a negative output great that's what we're looking for for itself is undefined you can't include it no matter what at four again it's undefined past four you're causing negative outputs until you get to six which is an x-intercept and that's allowed and that's exactly how i want you to go through uh using these inequalities as they relate to functions just kind of have a picture in your head just remember that it's all about the x-axis it's what portion of the x-axis is causing your outputs to relate somehow to this inequality i hope that makes sense from here we're going to dive into inequalities of polynomials and i'll show you some of this idea as we we get a number line because an x-axis is a number line if you think through what they're asking you like i've just shown you inequalities of polynomials become quite easy and then we'll do something very similar with rational so see for those videos
