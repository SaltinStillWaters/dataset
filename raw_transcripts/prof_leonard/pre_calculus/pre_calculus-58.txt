Transcript for: Properties of Logarithms (Precalculus - College Algebra 58)
hey hope you're still doing well in this video what we're going to do is we're going to talk about the properties of logarithms there's really only that's kind of five of them but we group one of them together so it's really only four we're going to talk about the four property of logarithms just some basic examples on how they work and then we're going to use those in the next few videos to combine some logarithms expand some logarithms use What's called the change of Base formula and then we'll be finally ready to start tackling some of these problems that have some complicated equations with exponentials and logarithms just understanding these these ideas so here are the properties of logarithms as you need to know them the first one is this I've said a couple of these before but there's some some things that we need to remember all the time number one if you ever have a logarithm where the argument is one you are going to get zero and here's the reason why any base raised to the zero power is always going to give you one therefore a logarithm of any base of one is equal to Z this is exactly where man I hope you remember it when we graph logarithms this is exactly where the key point of 1 comes from input of one output of zero one zero is on every single logarithm before you start shifting it that's where that came from likewise a logarithm with a base of a of a if you have the same base here and here this is always going to equal one why because a to the first power is always going to give you a actually to the first Power it's almost a trivial statement it says a raised to what power gives you a a to the first Power gives you a and it's consequently why on every graph of a logarithm you had a key point of a one you plug in a you get out one for whatever base you have I hope that makes sense to you we had one zero we had a comma 1 for every logarithm ever that's where they come from and that's why these properties work is if you have a one you're going to get a zero if you have an A you're going to get a one and that translates to one more thing this is extendable so a to the first Power gives you a to the 1st but a to the r power is going to give you a to the r look at what we have done we've talked about in the last video but we've composed an exponential onto a logarithm with the same base two inverses an exponential and a logarithm are always going to cancel each other out so when you compose them in either order everything's going to go away everything's going to cancel out and and you get these trivial statements you say a raised to what power is going to give you a to the r power well this would have to be R and if you think back to what happened when we composed a function and its inverse everything canel and you got X well in this case our X is actually R so everything's in cancel you're going to get R and that's exactly what's happening here you have an exponential on a logarithm the same base they're going to cancel and give you whatever that exponent is this case you're going to get R and it says the same thing a to the r power equals a the r power we've explored this before we what we haven't seen is this one it is a similar concept You' just composed the inverses differently now we know from compositions whether we compose a function and its inverse or an inverse and its function you still get the same thing you still get everything cancels out same thing happens here when you compose a logarithm onto an exponential this acts as the exponent of some exponential but it has the same base so you've composed a function on its inverse it will cancel and give you in this case M and what it says is if you were to go and write this in logarithmic form right now it's in exponential form it would say you'd have a log let's see I'm going to do this for you you'd have a if I would logarithms here's my base I have to do it over here I didn't plan on doing this here's my base of a here's my exponent a logarithm takes the base and separates the exponent here's my base is a logarithm here's my exponent and makes the argument whatever this is and we get a trivial statement and this is this is saying the same thing as that it's saying hey uh what would my argument be if I have log base a of something equals log base a of M it would have to be M that's what that's saying so how we use these is really nice these are extremely quick just understand the nature of what you're doing don't treat it like just a rule like oh it's 13 1/34 7 1/4 and 8 those are all true but think about what is happening you have composed an exponential with a base of two on a logarithm base of two those are two inverse functions composed when you compose inverse functions they cancel you're going to get3 and that's why now it is just this rule isn't it here's our BAS is the same we're just going to get the exponent and that's what's going on but the reason behind it it's important to know next one hey have you composed a logarithm and its in well an exponential and its inverse of a logarithm that's a base of 10 that's a log with a base of 10 we don't write it but that's a base of 10 so you have an exponential on a logarithm the same base it's going to cancel you still have this problem this property right here with the same bases they're going to simplify you're going to get 1/3 same thing happens here we have an exponential with a base of e we have a logarithm with a base of e now we write that as Ln but that is a log base e an exponential composed on a logarithm the same bases your bases match up you're going to simplify this is going to give you -4 all of these things should make sense to you 2 to the -3 power = 23 10^ 1/3 power = 10 1/3 power they're trivial statements why because you've composed a function on its inverse e to the4 power equal e to the4 power yep how about this one well this is the other way we've composed a logarithm onto an exponential but you still have the same base this is a function compos on its inverse it's going to simplify and give you in this case seven we're right here right now bases match up they're going to simplify same thing happens here log base 10 on an exponential base 10 well you've composed a function on its inverse that has to simplify has to cancel out here you have a log base e on an exponential base e you've composed a function on inverse those have to cancel out and these are all three instances of this property where you have the bases the same you're going to simplify and get just the argument every time that's pretty useful we see that from time to time we're going to see it in a couple of these examples uh where we have composed the function on its inverse either purposefully that's when we're solving we're purposely composing a function on its inverse when we're solving exponentials and logarithms or uh in the in the working out or simplification of some of our our logarithms we sometimes see this and then we can simplify as we go that's very useful let's go on to the next couple properties so the next ones in order to really make these stick I want you to think about how logarithms are created logarithms come from some sort of an exponential they're an inverse of an exponential and because of that these properties minimic exponential rules so ex think exponent rules now they're not exactly exponent rules because they're not exactly exponents they come from exponentials but they're not exp exponents themselves and so they they model they're they model those exponent rules pretty closely but they're not exact so they're inverses so so check it out now if we ever have log base a of a product so M * n we can separate that we can separate that by using addition now now why addition well when you multiply common bases don't you add those exponents well yeah so multiplication is somehow tied together with this addition concept much like you have for exponents and that's a true statement for logarithms if you have a product inside of one logarithm you can separate this into two logarithms with the same base of a a sum so a sum of two logarithms also this is a really big note I want you to make a really important note here this is not a one-way street so what that means is if you have two logarithms and they're added together and they have the same base you can multiply their arguments inside one logm not add notice what is not up here nowhere have I had logarithm of Base a of m + n that's not expandable and nowhere will I have log base a of M time log base a of n that's not combinable that doesn't work and so what I'm giving you here this is really important is that I'm giving you the only rules that actually work to expand and combine logarithms don't don't think outside the box here don't invent your own math it's really common for students to do but we just cannot do it if it's not up here then you can't do it with logarithms if I haven't told it to you and the only other one that I can think of is change of base right now we're going to get that a little bit later but if it's not one of these you can't expand by it you can't combine by it so the next one's very very similar imagine this imagine if you're multiplying and multiplication give you some sort of addition concept what's division going to give you multiplication is to division as addition is to subtraction in the in the case of our our logarithm rules so what we do here if we have a log base a of m / n we can separate that we can expand it by subtraction think of your division of exponents if you add a to the N oh sorry X the M over X the N we would subtract those exponents and that's sort of where this is coming from so if we have log base a of m / n division is somehow tied together with the subtraction concept also these are not oneway streets they're two-way streets so you can expand a logarithm with division inside as subtracting a difference of two logarithms of the same base or if you have two logarithms the same base being subtracted you can combine it into a logarithm with division not subtraction these are both important we use both of these when we're solving exponentials and logarithms we need to know them kind of backwards and forwards to be able to expand and combine all right the last one it's called the power property if you ever have an exponent log base a of something to some exponent you can move that exponent or power called the power property to the front as a coefficient fascinating piece of math but what it says is that you can expand any sort of exponent as a coefficient or if you have a coefficient you can move that as an exponent this is how we start isolating logarithms to make it one logarithm without anything multiply or divided we can move that as an exponent well likewise if you have an exponent you really don't want it like what if that's a radical wait a minute a radical is like a 1/3 power or 1/2 power or a fractional exponent you can now move that as a coefficient you can get rid of any radicals inside of your logarithm provided the entire argument is under that that radical well that's really neat that really helps us out in a lot of cases so we can go backwards and forwards without power property now it's time to practice it let's take these I'm going to show you the thought process he going through we'll expand all of these and just use some of the properties that we can as we go through so um when we start talking about log base 5 of 25 to X we're trying to simplify this here's some things that we can think of number one can you expand via products can you understand that if that's a product I can expand this well how how would I do it if I look back there's only one thing that lets me expand a product it says I can take log base 5 of 25 plus log base 5 of X the only reason I have the parenthesis here is to make sure that we understand this is the end of the argument I'm not adding something inside of that that logarithm so log base 5 of 25 plus log Bas 5 of X says product equals plus that's what I need in your head product equals plus plus equals product can we simplify further well log base 5 of X that's not simplifi there's nothing we don't know what x is there's nothing we really do but log base 5 of 25 there are a few ways to simplify this now this is going to lead us down to the statement that there's more than one way to do do a lot of this work with logarithms as long as you're using an appropriate property that we've seen you're going to be fine I'm going to show you uh at least two ways to think about this here's the first way to think about this first way is I'm show you three ways the first way is um can you just think five raised to what power gives you 25 you go five 5 squar is 25 oh hey two this is going to be two guaranteed that's one way you could do it another way you could do it could you write this as log base 5 of 5^ s well sure 25 is 5^ s but think about what this means if this is base base and they're the same you now have this property log base a of a r is log base 5 of 5 to the 2 the log base 5 and the five that's an exponential composed on a log them with the same base that's inverses composed they're going to cancel you're going to get two what else could you do could you now use this property and move your exponent to the front well that's possible here's my exponent I can move it to the front as a coefficient log base 5 of 5 to the first power or simply log base 5 of 5 that's this property that's going to give you one oh wait hey do you remember that on every single logarithm we have the base comma one that's what that's saying that says log base 5 of five let's see how do I get to five from five to five what power is that that's a power one so this would simplify to a 1 2 * 1 is 2 no matter what you're going to end up getting 2 + log base 5 of x now that is as simple as we can make it but understand what this does for you this makes something a lot easier to graph that might be kind of diff difficult to graph this is not oh man you I hope that you see this this is a logarithm it's got a base of five so that means we have a0 1 0 and 5 comma 1 those are my key points furthermore that's a shift up two units there's no horizontal shift but this is out of order that's a shift up to got a key point of one zero got a key point of 51 there's no horizontal shift at all there's no vertical stretch you could graph this very easily with what I've taught you in the graphing video I hope that's fascinating that doing this makes it easier to actually do things like graphing cool we're just using some very simple properties okay let's focus on the next one so we've got this Ln of e overx the first thing I want you to notice is that we can separate quotients if we're talking about expanding by subtraction so when we do that that says take your your logarithm that is a logarithm it has a base of e and take that quotient create two logarithms that are being subtracted so division creates a subtraction concept for us and then we see if we can simplify each one Ln X well there's nothing we can really do much like the log base 5 of X in the previous example but L and E well that's wait a minute this has a base of e this is exponential with a base of e You' just composed an exponential onto a logarithm of the same base they're going to cancel but they're not going to give you zero this is this case right now so we have the same base even though we don't write log we write Ln it still is a base of e and a base of e they're going to simplify and they're going to give you one if you want to think down to this this route if you want to write the base of uh sorry the exponent of one there base matches base exponent compos logarithm with the same base it's going to cancel it's going to give you one that's about as good as we can make it but notice that you could graph this a bit easier oh man do you see it do you see that this this is a logarithm of the base of e so what are your key points well your key points are one Z and E comma 1 that's like 2.7 comma 1 this is shifted up one unit this is then reflected You' defect the outputs of your keyo points it would reflect that exponential I I making making it make sense to you I hope I'm making you see the connections of what I've taught you to what you're doing now it should not be completely separated it should be one big unit of information it's like oh this relates this is now easier to graph than that do you want to graph that I don't to graph that do you want to graph that that's easy that's a shift up one that's a reflection I've got key points of one z e comma 1 my my outputs would reflect and I could graph it very nicely that's much nicer okay last example it starts out pretty much the same we've got this logarithm of this division so this this quotient inside of one logarithm we can expand it and sometimes it's very nice we're seeing this this is much easier to graph if we expand that so let's do it so this logarithm would be Ln of the [Music] numerator minus the denominator I probably would put parenthesis here I might put parenthesis here you don't have to there's nothing after it but we do need to understand how this works how this works is it takes and makes your loog the first logarithm of your numerator minus the logarithm of your denominator that order is important it's not communed you can't switch it around so numerator is first denominator is second in that that difference after that we look to simplify whatever we can lnx you're done there's really nothing we can do there there's no basis that match there's no moving exponents there really is an exponent besides one and that doesn't help us to move you just get one times something which gives you back that something it's multiplicative identity so that doesn't really affect anything but Ln of e to X I need you to notice that I need you to notice that we are here I'm I'm going to throw a lot of these at you so that you do recognize it's very common in calculus for students to not simplify that because they're not seeing that e explicitly Ln of e to some exponent is always cancelable because you've composed an exponential on a logi of the same base so you can see why I'm throwing these at you so that you go oh yeah that's right okay that that simplifies so so I'm I'm getting you in the mode of when you see this later you can understand why they're calling this just X it's not magic it's composing an exponential on a logarithm going oh that is certainly going to simplify we have a actually have a property for that this says e to what power gives you e to X well e to X gives you e x you're going to cancel this it is an exponential compos on the inverse of a logarithm it's going to simplify to just X just like this simplifies just to3 your bases match I just need you to see it you can post a function with its inverse and that cancels so that's where we're going to end here this is a little bit more difficult to graph than some of the other ones uh but it it is possible that's certainly easier than trying to graph that thing so I hope that I've uh explained these properties to you that they're they're Loosely based on exponent rules which is why products are mapped to pluses and quotients are mapped to differences um this one's a little special with what we Nether X we get into that a little bit later on why that actually works so watch out for that U we'll come back with how to com how to combine and expand logarithms in general so we'll deal with expanding first as much as we can much hard than what I've given you here this is just an introduction and then we'll talk about how to combine them and then we'll be ready to solve exponentials molecules in general hope you're having fun hope you're doing well see you soon
