Transcript for: Graphing Exponential Functions with Transformations (Precalculus -College Algebra 53)
welcome to another video so in this video we are going to graph the exponentials that we talked about in the last video we discovered why the graphs look the way that they do in the last video now is our time to practice that so i'm going to show you exactly how to graph exponential functions with some transformations we're going to see that all the transformations that we learned earlier all the shifting left and right up and down and reflecting this across the x-axis across the y-axis all the vertical stretch compression that still works we just need to know how to read them so the ideas to get out of this are that we have some key points there's only two of them we have a horizontal asymptote we're going to use that with our shifting to get a really good picture of our graph all the shifting is still going to work so we've got five examples are going to go pretty quickly i'm going for for quantity here to make sure we see a lot of different cases we'll come back with some examples of exponentials that involve euler number or the natural number this e and then we'll be done so let's refresh on what exponentials actually mean exponentials are this constant raised to an exponent that is a variable a is going to be greater than one or less than one yielding two different graphs if a is more than one we discovered last time this is going to be an always increasing function and if a is less than one we get a decreasing function a is not going to equal one otherwise we get a horizontal line and that's very boring and not exciting like exponential should be also we we know that in both of these cases we have two key points and a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero the key points are always due to the nature of what exponentials do zero one and one comma whatever your base is zero one because if you plug in 0 a constant raised to 0 always gives you 1. and 1 comma a because if you plug in 1 anything raised to the first power is going to give you back that anything and that is our base so let's explore our model the process for going through these what our shifting is going to look like and then we'll graph these honestly really quick so let's take a look at it we have a function 3 to the x minus 2. i'm going to make sure you understand that that minus 2 is being subtracted from the function so when we look at this we think this is based on an exponential first thing i want you to do with an exponential is put down the key points so the key points are always 0 1 and one comma our base well our base is three so zero one and one comma three now here's what's going to happen we're going to shift this graph so this is based on the function 3 to the x but we're going to shift it we're going to understand what that minus 2 does we'll shift this and then we'll put our key points on the graph in relation to where we shifted it not here at 0 1 and 1 3 that would have been the case if we hadn't have shifted it but that does something to it and so just like we did before the transformations we're going to put this in relation to where our our shifted x and y axis actually went so we go okay we have our key point zero one and one comma base that happens every time we have exponentials then we're going to identify what our shifting actually does so here's where to look we look at the end of our function and we determine whether something's being added or subtracted after our exponential part of this is over and if that's the case we have a vertical shift then we look in the exponent if anything's added or subtracted that's going to be a horizontal shift then we look in front in front of our exponential remember our exponential is positive so that's a positive number anything in front of that is going to be a a vertical shift or compression or reflection if it's negative so here i see my exponential function and then a minus 2. that minus 2 is not with the exponent it's not even with exponential it's after it that's a shift down 2. so this is a vertical shift down 2. from there we look for a left or right shift well that would be inside my exponent so x plus or x minus some number that's not there so we don't have any sort of a horizontal shift i'm just going to show that by putting my x and my y axis with these dotted lines and here's what that does for us that creates this this place where i can use my key points to illustrate a shifting of this original three to the x graph but in relation to where these things actually shifted so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to look in front of my function there's nothing being multiplied you don't count this as a multiplier here that is your base it's where these points came from a multiplier in front of it would look something like this like that number that would be a vertical stretch here it would look a little awkward but it would look something like if you had a vertical stretch it would look something like this that would be a vertical stretch in this case you take your four you'd multiply your outputs by your four to get your new key points the three itself is your base you don't multiply the base before the exponential exponent you take 3 to the exponent and then you multiply by 4. that you do the function first and then multiply by 4 that is what it would create this multiplying the y or the output and growing your function or shrinking your function or reflecting your function that's what that does so this 3 is your base there's no changing that anything multiplied in front of it would look like this sometimes we get a little sloppy and we say we don't show the parentheses which we should and you'd get 4 times 3 of x that 4 would still be that vertical shift you would in no way ever get 12 to the x please keep that in mind so here we look at it we go yep that's a vertical shift down two there's no left or right shift there's no manipulating of the outputs or key points that means no reflections no vertical stretch compression we are just going to plot our key points from where we shifted this so zero 1 is in relation to this new shifted axis system for us this maintains your horizontal asymptote that's really nice that's what we that's why we show this with this technique so 0 1 says i'm right here 0 1 in relation to this this would be like 0 0 this is now 0 1 and then 1 comma 3 in relation to this new sort of x y axis but with the same scale so here's zero one here's one comma one two three and because i know that my base is more than one i know that i'm going to get a climbing function already so i have that picture in my head i also know that because i plotted my key points there's no way that this can't decline this has to be an increasing function oh yeah our base is more than one that should be the case so we looked at we said we have a base that's more than one it's going to be climbing we have this exponential function it's going to have key points 0 1 always and 1 comma whatever your base is we shifted down 2 that moves our horizontal asymptote we did not shift left or right well that moves that does not move this y-axis that we have we're going to graph our function like we know it should look if you need to be more precise you can plug in some other values so if you plugged in two two three to the second power is nine nine minus two would be seven and you'll find some some actual physical points here please keep this in mind i know we've done transformations at least three times and so this should be there already but if it's not if you're forgetting this these points are not on this graph exactly they are from the shifted version of where you did this so you're using your key points to give yourself a very accurate graph but your actual points that these transform to are the points zero negative one and one comma one this is just a really useful way to graph it that's all we do it for is to get a really nice picture of it so this model is everything our exponential should it is an increasing graph we do that because our base was more than one we shifted we have our key points and we just throw it on there and make a pretty decent graph so let's take a look at what a a horizontal shift would look like so taking a look at f of x equals two to the x plus 2. i want you to notice something first right off the bat that this is based on an exponential and the base is 2. this again should be a base greater than 1 you should get an increasing function unless we start reflecting it so let's identify if this is our base then right now we should come up with our key points our key points for exponentials are 0 1 that's where we start and one comma whatever our base is one comma two in this case because our base is two then we start identifying any transformations that we have how i'd like you to do this and this is going to make a lot more sense when we do it how i want you to do is i want you to look at the exponent and if there's anything added or subtracted in your exponent put a parenthesis around that and what that's going to do that's going to clue your brain into oh right that's affecting my input affecting my input moves on the input axis or the x-axis it'll also make certain that you don't accidentally think that's a vertical shift up to so anything next to your exponent you put that in parentheses and it says this is not a vertical shift so we look here hey there's nothing being added or subtracted after my function that's not a vertical shift i look inside my function oh right that's why i put parentheses that's a plus 2. that's a shift to the left too we did not shift vertically at all so there is no adding or subtracting after the function no vertical shift there's a shift left two that's adding to inside my function affecting the input affects the input axis we shifted left too notice how our horizontal asymptote doesn't shift it's still at y equals zero then we look in front of our function out in front of this two and see if anything's being multiplied are we do we have a negative out there uh do we multiply by anything that stretches our function and we don't so we're not affecting our key points here our key points are still 0 1 and 1 2 but they have also been shifted haven't they the whole thing's been shifted and so we're going to plot those in relation to where we shifted from or sorry i shifted to so 0 1 same scale 0 1 and then 1 comma 2. so where these dotted lines intersect that acts like your origin so that you can punch key points zero one would be here one comma two would be here that's our key points put in relation to our shifted axes because we didn't shift up or down our horizontal asymptote still maintains that's why we still draw that dotted line to make certain that we understand okay this is this is really where it is let's make sure we get that right this is our horizontal asymptote still and we're going to graph that if you want to be more accurate it's really nice to have a y-intercept so if you wanted to find a y-intercept you can always do that by evaluating for zero so if we take this and we evaluate for zero zero plus two is two two squared is four now this point doesn't get shifted because you're literally evaluating it so you're plugging in 0 saying where am i crossing this this is the real y-axis this was just shifted so that we get a nice graph this is the y-axis if i plug in 0 i'm going to get out 4. we've got to behave with our horizontal asymptote we've got to behave with our key points from our new shifted axes and we've got to behave with our y intercept that's a really good picture of that graph for minimal work i hope you're seeing the ideas here the ideas are always identifieds and exponential write down your key points 0 1 and 1 comma your base depends on your base then identify your shifting vertical is always after the function horizontal is always within your exponent and then out front affects your key points then we shift it we put our key points in relation to our axes that we shifted and we try to get some other point on there to give us a better picture here we could have used something like two and gotten seven it's just a little bit high for this graph okay let's move on so we have f of x equals negative three x to the x plus one we're going to start the same way because this has a base raised to an exponent that is a variable this is an exponential and we are going to immediately write down our key points one thing to look at here this confuses some people so be careful some people say wait a minute i thought your base couldn't be negative it can't and that's not if we remember order of operations remember that exponents happen before multiplication and so this is not negative 3 raised to the x power this is 3 raised to the x power and it has a negative out front in fact it has a negative 1 out front this right here looks confusing but oh man i hope that you remember this this is big is a big deal do you remember that these are completely different things completely different this says you're taking negative 2 that number to the fourth power that's what that says you can think of it this way you can think about this as negative 1 times 2 to the fourth and because exponents distribute across multiplication you take negative one to the fourth you would take two to the fourth you would get positive 16 out of that that doesn't happen here you see if you think about this as negative one times two to the fourth only the two is being raised to the fourth power not the negative one it's a matter of order of operations the exponent takes precedence over the multiplication because they can always separate a negative as negative one times a positive number we have to look at what is actually being raised to that fourth power here both the negative one and the two are here it's not that way it's just the two this would give you negative 16 well this gives you positive this is what is going on there so if you want some help on getting these right i would really recommend writing it just a little bit different if you write it as the base in parentheses it's very helpful to see what's really going on here i hope that makes sense your base can't be negative and it's not negative the base is 3 3 is being raised to the x power that's a variable and that is our our exponent and then there's a negative one in front of that that's what's really happening i hope you're with me on that one it's it's very much this this case so with that in mind now we understand our key points our key points are always 0 1 and 1 comma your base your base here is 3 not negative 3. after that we start identifying any transformations that we have so we're looking at the back end of our function after the after the exponent and we're saying all right that plus one that is a vertical shift up one unit i'm looking next to my exponent so in the exponent next to my variable i don't see any pluses or minuses that means that there's no left or right shift after that we look out front this is where that negative makes sense that negative says oh that is going to be a reflection oh do you remember that do you remember how negatives out front affect the output think through what you would have to do here if you were to plug in a value like let's say let's say four okay you said you take three to the fourth power that's what you do first you want to take negative three you take three to the fourth power that's 81. then you'd make it negative that's negative 81. that is a reflection and that's what that negative does it always does this in front of a function it's going to be a reflection about the x-axis well for us what that does we show that by affecting our outputs of our key points so we found key points great we identified a vertical shift cool we said there's no horizontal shift no problem now we look out front and say that is really a negative one negative one is going to affect my output values not my inputs i'm still going to get zero i'm still going to get one but my outputs have now been reflected so from our shifted axes that's shifted axis system where this acts like an origin no it's not our origin but acts like it for our key points i'm going to plot these new key points 0 negative 1 so if that's 0 0 that's zero negative one and one comma negative three one two this would be zero negative one this would be from here 0 negative 1 and 1 comma negative 3. our horizontal asymptote is shown that's why we show those dotted lines that's why this technique works i always like teaching things that always work for transformations and this technique does look straight and then we're going to plot this oh this is fantastic this is reflected like we thought it would be this still has a horizontal asymptote it's just now decreasing there we go if you want to be a bit more accurate you start plugging in some other values uh we have two and we have the shape of this so it's it's pretty nice but you could plug in something like positive two just remember when you plug in values or evaluate and you use your function you're finding those values according to your true x and y axis your key points are just a tool for you to graph this easily i hope you get that these key points are just in relation to your shifted axes the actual points here are zero zero and one comma negative two yeah sure and you can find more like that if you plug in two or evaluate for positive two um you do this you do three to the second power is nine then you have negative one times 9 that's negative 9 plus 1 is negative 8 so you plot 2 negative 8 from your true x y axis i hope that makes sense okay we have a couple more one thing about functions is they're they're really a lot easier to determine what's going on if they're in some sort of an order that we we can anticipate their their their transformations so when we have 1 minus 2 to the x plus 3 this doesn't look all that good make sure that we put this in order with your exponential first so i would put negative 2x 2 to the x plus 3 and then plus 1. the other thing that i'm going to do so that i don't get confused on my my vertical versus horizontal shift i'm going to put this in parentheses anything next to your variable in the exponent is going to be a horizontal shift it's affecting the input it affects a shift on the input axis anything afterwards should be a vertical shift that's why the order is important so that you can easily see this now the last thing i'm going to do i'm going to make absolutely certain that i know that my base is 2 and not negative two that negative is going to be that reflection again that's important for us to understand that this does not multiply by negative two on your outputs this did not multiply by negative three on your outputs it multiplied by negative one your base stays the same your base is three it's the negative that was affecting the output there same thing's going to happen here so we identified it's an exponential we maybe put it in a better form and now we show our key points our key points are 0 1 and one comma whatever your base is because your base is two we get one comma two then we start identifying our shifts i see here this is a vertical shift up one i also see that we have a horizontal shift left three from there from that that those dotted lines that don't really exist uh they're just given a really good picture of a horizontal asymptote where we're shifting and letting you plot your key points from it we're going to plot our key points so we're going to plot these things but we do have to manipulate them if we have something in front of our exponential so this was up one this was left three this was a base of two what that negative does that negative x like multiplying your output by negative one so we're going to take that negative we're going to say all right my inputs do not change but my outputs get reflected because they're being multiplied by negative 1. our base is not negative two that negative and this negative affect the outputs of those key points of that exponential with that base so from where we shifted we're going to say our key points are zero negative one here's zero zero here's zero negative one and one comma negative two from zero zero here's one comma negative two we still have a horizontal asymptote which is why we draw that dotted line and now we might wanna do something like find the true y-intercept so plug in zero evaluate for zero in either of these things zero plus three is three two to the third is eight and one minus eight is negative seven that's going to give us a much better picture of what truly happens so that crosses the y-axis and continues downward to negative infinity this graph and its base form of 2 to the x would be always increasing because we reflected it that's what this does this is always decreasing you should be able to look at this function once you write it appropriately and tell me the three transformations we have you should tell me this is a vertical shift a horizontal shift of left three and a reflection about the x axis that's what you should be able to do i hope that that is is being confirmed in your mind that that's right so that's about it now we're going to move on to the last example we have three times one half to the x i gotta give you a fraction you know me and we'll make sure that we understand everything about that so let's do it when we have an exponential it's important to first identify that it is an exponential and what the base is the base here is not one and a half you cannot multiply these that breaks the order operations just like you could not multiply these or like you could not multiply these that would break the order operations exponents happen before multiplication we talked about that so identifying our base our base is one-half now let's think about that if a base is one-half that means that our basic graph shape for an exponential should be decreasing we should get this picture in if before we start shifting things around we also can identify our key points key points for exponentials are always 0 1 and 1 comma whatever the base is now we can go ahead and identify transformations we don't have a vertical shift there's nothing being added after our exponential we don't have a horizontal shift there's nothing being added to our exponent or subtracted we do have a vertical transformation that that is a vertical stretch here so that three that's going to take and multiply our outputs by three well let's do that for our key points so one times three is three and one half times three is one and a half or three halves we don't change our inputs this does not affect our inputs anything affecting our inputs would be next to our x variable because that is our input variable so we did not shift up or down we didn't shift left or right so we're going to plot our key points based on that vertical stretch of 0 3 and 1 comma 1 and a half we still have our horizontal asymptote but notice what you keep going to do why i'm teaching it to you do you see how if you plot your key points there is no ambiguity you are you have to decrease to make this happen and if you have just a basic understanding of what these graphs look like it's not that bad so we understand this is exponential it should be decreasing unless i start reflecting it messing with it and it does we see that this thing is going to decrease if we wanted to be more accurate you might want to plug in something like negative 1. negative one here would give us one half to the negative one power that's two three times two is six so this would cross at or sorry across this would have a point at negative one six about right there still has to obey the horizontal asymptote that was not shifted that's about what this graph looks like and it's modeled very well on what we understand our base to be originally so it should be decreasing we didn't reflect it or anything like that it's still decreasing so i hope that you've uh you've picked up a lot about these exponentials how they graph that the transformations we're using are the same ones we've been using the key points are just a little different there's zero one and one one comma whatever your base is that's great you just have to identify your base i'm gonna come back with three i would call like a a little bit more difficult because we're dealing with e and we're going to see a reflection of the y-axis so hang on for that we got three more allied so two more not three more uh because i put a couple together i made extra hard and so i wanted to make sure that we can do it so anyhow we're going to get through two more examples of graphing exponentials this time with a base of e we'll see what that means we need to remember what e is e is approximately 2.7 it's not exactly 2.7 but we're going to use that to get a sketch of our graph so let's take a look at f of x e to the x plus 2 minus 1 please keep in mind that just because you have an e up there it's still an exponential that's not a variable it's just a constant number that's around 2.7 and we're going to graph exactly the same way so how should this graph look well because e is 2.7 about and that's more than one it should still be an increasing graph our a is still more than one we're just going to identify the shifts the same exact way plot with our key points the same way so because we have an exponential with a base of e we can deal with our key points our key points are still 0 1 and 1 comma the base it just so happens that our base is e and now we're going to identify our shifting also remember that it's pretty nice and a pretty good idea to put any numbers that are added or subtracted to your exponent inside parentheses it's going to clue your brain into the fact this is a shift to the left too so we're looking at saying this minus one is after exponential that's a vertical shift that's down one we also have this plus two that's next to our x variable in parenthesis that's a shifting on the horizontal axis plus means left two after that we've already identified our key points but we're gonna look in front and we're gonna make sure that nothing is affecting them so out here nothing's being multiplied there's no negative there's no reflection there's only two transformations here down one and left two so we're going to plot our key points in relation to this new where we shifted to axis we have a horizontal asymptote we show that that's great we're going to plot 0 1 so if this acts like 0 0 then this is 0 1 the true point is of course negative 2 0 and we're also going to plot 1 comma e now now 1 comma e think of e as 2.7 when you're doing this 1 comma e therefore would be 1 comma 1 2.7 that gives us a good approximation for where that point is it's not exact because we can't exactly plot e but we're close now how about the y-intercept if you wanted to do this take your calculator out and plug in or evaluate for zero the true zero where you're going to cross the true y-axis 0 plus 2 is 2. e squared's about 7.4 minus 1 is about 6.4 so this would cross the x-axis at about 6.4 keep in mind we have a horizontal asymptote that's been shifted down so you are going to cross the x axis here the only time you do with exponentials is if you shift them we still behave with that and that's about how that graph looks going to be climbing like we thought it was more steeply than 2 to the x because that's a larger number larger base than 2. that's what that graph should look like there now the last one so uh oh man that's really out of order it's really nasty let me show you a couple things to help you with this number one put it in order number two we're going to take a look at our base make sure that we find our key points and that this is based on an exponential so this is this is certainly an exponential we have a base of e so we're going to write our key points down it is in order and then we start to manipulate that exponent you see here's what we need in order for us to determine our transformations accurately number one we need an order we have that number two we need to see what the base is we know that number three we've got to make sure that our exponent has a positive x in it it needs that to identify what happens next to it and so that negative x plus one that's really awkward it's going to lead us to think it's a left shift when it's actually a right shift but you have to factor to do that so do you remember hopefully like five seconds ago i said put your exponent in parentheses well that's true but put your exponent in parenthesis so that your x is positive all right well let's try that so if i do that i'm going to factor that negative that negative does something for us and so does that negative 2 out front we are now ready to start identifying our transformations and there's a lot of them in here one two three there's five transformations right now and we'll talk about all of them and when to use them yeah that's a lot so the first thing that we're going to do is after we do order after we identify exponential after we write down our key points and after we put things in the correct structure so that we can identify our transformations we start showing them so that plus 5 that is after our function that is a vertical shift up 5. we are going to draw that then we look inside of our function so inside parentheses next to our our variable next to our x variable which um which anything that that is next that's going to act as a and an affecting of the x-axis so when we look at this there's two things going on number one inside the parentheses after you've factored it you need that x positive to identify this inside the parentheses that minus 1 is a shift to the right one okay what's that negative do if you remember from a long time ago that negative right there that is next to the x variable isn't it well the x is the input variable yeah but that negative 1 that negative looks like it's being multiplied by that input variable it is and that's exactly what's going to happen to our inputs so next to the input variable affects things on the input axis so that negative says i'm going to take your inputs and make them negative let that affect this so when we start changing our key points that's up five that's right one that right there says take your inputs and multiply them by negative one they essentially change the sign of your inputs zero can't but one can so one becomes negative one that is what that does and what that's going to do imagine this imagine take your inputs and change their sign it's going to reflect across the y axis we saw that earlier but that's happening again so vertical shift up five horizontal shift right one reflecting about the y-axis now this does two things we showed it one time but it does two things that is affecting the output of your key points and every point really this is saying take something plug it in yeah you're manipulating it e to that power is going to give you an output and that multiplies the output by negative two so take our outputs multiply by negative two so negative 2 times 1 is negative 2 negative 2 times e is negative 2 e you can approximate that with a calculator 2.7 times 2 is 5.4 negative is negative 5.4 ish so that we're gonna keep that in our head now what does that actually do up five right one reflect about the y that is a vertical stretch because it's more than one and that is reflecting about the x so this is about everything that you can have in a transformed graph we have a vertical shift horizontal shift a reflection across the y a reflection across the x and a vertical stretch you can't have both a vertical stretch or and vertical compression otherwise i would have showed that to you um but you can have one or the other and that's what we've done here so we've gone up five we've gone right one we have our key points all it's up to is a plot that's all you need to do if you follow my technique and you do your shifting with your dotted lines and you get your key points and multiply them correctly like i've shown you next to input input next to output affect your output and just plot those so if that acts like our origin then 0 negative 2 is right here and negative 1 negative 2 e remember negative 2 is about 5.4 but negative negative 1. according to where we say we think of our origin as acting negative one count one two three four five point four that's it we know we have a horizontal asymptote and because we used our key points we know that this graph it is an exponential right but think about this this graph has been moved around if that's a base of e it's been shifted up and right and reflected this way and this way this graph has to be increasing but behaving with these key points it's going to have to look like this your key points show that and you have a horizontal asymptote you can't do this because you fail to hit both these points you have to do this and meet that asymptote plugging in some more values would be nice so we could plug in negative one negative one into this function would give us either way you wanted to go this would give us negative one minus one is negative two that'd be positive two e squared we've already done that actually so e squared is seven point four negative two times seven point four uh that's like negative 14.8 plus five negative nine point eight so this would be negative one comma negative nine point eight it is down there it's it's kind of dramatic because we have that vertical stretch and it's e which is um two about 2.7 as your base i hope that i've made that one make sense there's a lot going on in that problem but i'm glad we did it because it shows you about as hard as it gets for graphing transformations we have everything in there i could think of so anyway i hope that you're doing well i hope this is making sense to you we're going to come back and we're going to talk about how to start solving exponentials before we get into the graphs of logarithms just so we have some place to to start with with what you can do with exponents exponentials hope it's making sense and i'll see you soon
