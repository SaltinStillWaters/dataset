Transcript for: How to Use the Law of Cosines in Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 33)
welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about the law of cosines we just finished talking about the law of sines but there was two cases that the law of sines did not work for for these uh these oblique triangles and they were cases three and four so law of cosines does we'll talk about why it does we'll talk about why law of sines doesn't work i'll tell you exactly what law of cosines looks like and how to work with it it is quite a bit more straightforward than law of sines because there are are not two cases that can work like these uh side side angle that we saw with law of sines so what law of cosines does working with these oblique triangles like we know it does it will solve your triangle for you if you know two sides and the angle between them so the sides are adjacent to the angle or if you know all three sides of triangle it will solve the rest of it for you so we're going to take a look first at this what the law of cosine says how to apply it to two sides of the angle between why why law of sines will not work for that and then um all three sides and y law of sines won't work for that so here's what the law of cosines says if you have a triangle and you don't know if it's a right triangle or not what law of cosines really talks about is a way to to compare an equation two sides and an angle between them with another side here's how it looks the law of cosines says a side squared is always equal to the other two sides squared and added so the sum of the other two sides squared minus twice the product of those sides and the cosine of the angle between them now that sounds like a lot that is a lot but i want you to notice a couple things about this this is a side this is the angle opposite that side this is the angle between these two sides so when you're setting this up you look for an angle that you know if you don't know an angle you're solving for an angle so you identify the angle you want to know just like you've done every other time identify the angle you want to know or the angle that you have and the side opposite is the one that you need to find why well because this works for side angle side this works for you know two sides and you're missing a third so naturally you want to find that third side well you need to know the angle between these two sides to do that this side is found by knowing these two sides boom boom boom boom and the angle between them right there that's exactly what that is talking about you know two sides an angle between them therefore you're able to find that side now what do you do after that you find the angles because you'll know all three sides you can find the angles after that now of course what if we're not just looking for side c what if we're looking for side a or b so there's three kind of permutations of this rearrangements that we can deal with if you wanted to find side b well then b squared would equal the sum of the squares of the other two sides minus twice the product of those sides and cosine of the angle between them if you remember that you don't have to remember the formulas as much just remember that this side and this angle are opposites and the rest of the stuff are the sides that you already know what if you're trying to find side a well then a squared is going to be the sum of the other two sides squared minus twice the product of those sides and cosine of the angle between them this is opposite that angle these sides you would know this is what the law of cosine says one more thing i want to mention is that if you know all three sides then you're solving for an angle because why would you want to solve for a side you already know it so this really only works in two cases if you know two sides and an angle between why because that allows you to set up this with all the information uh law of sines would not do that we'll see that in our very first example if you have all three sides then we'll be solving these four angles i'm going to give that to you right now as sort of an aside so if you were to solve this for cosine c cosine b and cosine a it would give you three different formulas how we're just going to subtract these two subtract these two and divide by this or you can think add this subtract your c squared and divide by two a b either way you go you'll end up with a different equation the other thing the last thing this is quite important i want you to see what would happen if that angle was 90 degrees think about this if that angle was 90 degrees do you remember what cosine of 90 degrees is do you remember cosine of pi over 2 it's zero if that's 90 degrees this part is zero this part is zero now think about this if that's 90 degrees what's the side opposite 90 degrees it would be a hypotenuse this would be a right triangle and you would get a squared plus b squared equals the hypotenuse squared if this angle was 90 degrees cosine of the angle 0 it zeros the whole thing out pythagorean theorem is a special case of the law of cosines if you have one of these angles 90 degrees and you have pythagorean theorem what if this angle is 90 degrees well then that would be the hypotenuse if this is 90 degrees this is zero that's a hypotenuse a squared plus c squared equals the hypotenuse squared it works it's just a special case so i'm going to solve these for you all i'm going to be doing is honestly i'm going to be adding this to both sides subtracting c squared and dividing by 2 a b and so you could use this to find your angles of course we plug all this in and then take cosine inverse of both sides to find find a missing angle this is typically the process we go through so i'm going to explain to you so there's no surprises if you have a side angle side yes you're using law of cosines we're going to find out that law of sines will not work you find the side you're missing first and then you find another angle second how do you do that you use either this if you have all three sides then naturally you're gonna be finding an angle and you'd have to use one of these so that's why i'm giving it to you that's why we're gonna practice it just to make sure that we're seeing it all right let's take a look at an example we got this triangle we know two sides and one angle now this is why it was so important to understand law of sines and the difference in law of cosines law of sines says you know two sides like we do and an angle but in law of sines the angle is not between those sides while cosines it is so which one is this we have a side then an angle then a side this is a law of cosines it's two sides with an angle between so in my head right now i'm thinking number one this is not a right triangle do you remember that like if we the first thing we do when we look at is think is this a right triangle um it's not or at least it's not telling me that it is so i cannot use right triangle trigonometry i'm looking at it and thinking okay let's categorize it uh this looks like it's a law of cosines because there's a side two sides in the angle that's not between them also i'm looking can i use anything outside of law of sines loft cosines trigonometry to solve for a missing side or angle you cannot please do not use pythagorean theorem you're not sure if that's a right triangle or not it's not you cannot use pythagorean theorem to solve for that side unless you are absolutely certain that you're dealing with the right triangle we can't use interior angle sum those are the two things we normally want to do before trying our trigonometry type stuff is pythagorean theorem it won't work uh anterior angle sum it won't work because we don't have enough information so we said right triangle no it's off the table what's it fit better law of sines law of cosines looks like law of cosines i don't have anything else i can fill out let's start labeling this triangle now so i'm going to call this side there's angle a and so this would be side a lowercase a let's call this angle b this would be lowercase v i'm i'm going to write that now just so that we can follow our formula if you're more of a formula type person it helps to label all of your sides and all of your angles so you can just plug it in if not if you're more of a concept person like like i am you don't really have to label a lot of this just the things you're missing and so this would be angle c and of course the opposite side of that would be lowercase letter c now because we already know that law of cosines is going to work we can follow one of these formulas but keep in mind what you need to do there's no way to solve for an angle right now you can't do it you don't have enough information if we tried we would only know two sides we'd only know one angle so we can't find another one of these angles because we'd be missing too much also notice notice why the law of sines does not work remember what law of sines does it takes one completed proportion a fraction and sets it equal to kind of half of a completed fraction in a proportion notice that we don't have that we don't have one complete fraction we have an angle with a missing side we have a missing angle with the side or missing angle with the side we'd have two pieces of information and we're asking for two more you can't do it you need to know three things in order to find a fourth thing with law of sines we'd have an angle over a oh man that's not completed a side over that's not completed or a side over that's not completed law of sines fails because of that that's why we had the side side angle working for law so cosine i love signs but side angle side the angles between them this is where law of cosine shines is because it works here law of sines doesn't i hope you see that i hope you see why it doesn't because our one of our our fractions in our proportion would not be completed we we can't complete either of them so it fails so what do we do well because you can't solve for an angle right now no notice if you tried to solve for let's say angle b you would need to know a and c we don't know a we can't solve for that angle if you want to solve for angle c we need to know a and b we don't know a therefore you can't solve for the angle so in order to solve for the angle you need to know the sides that are next to it that's what this is really saying you need to know the sides that are next to that in order to solve for that particular angle so our first step would be let's solve for this side that's opposite the angle that i know that's what this is going to let us do so when you deal with law of law of cosines and you have side angle side you're solving for this side first now if you're more formula oriented you've labeled everything then this is going to drive what formula you use you look at this and go i know my b i know my c i'm missing my side a i'm missing this you're going to use this one and then you fill out all of your information from that formula if you're more of a concept person like i am we write down the side that we're missing we think this is basically like pythagorean theorem it's just i have an angle between the two sides that i know and so what i'm going to do is i'm going to say okay a squared is going to equal 3 squared plus 4 squared the other two sides it doesn't matter the order in which you put those by the way i know i might be out of order here it doesn't matter addition's commutative and multiplication is commutative it doesn't matter what does matter is matching up this side with cosine of the angle opposite it so i'm missing side whatever it is a i have 3 squared plus 4 squared great great i'm going to subtract 2 times their product and then cosine of the angle between them if it's the angle between them that angle is opposite the side you want to know so this and this angle are always opposite in law of cosines so this and this angle so i'm going to put cosine of 30 degrees i'm going to double check uh side i want to know equals sum of the other two sides squared great i've squared the set i want want to know minus 2 times their product i've done that and cosine of angle between them which is also the angle opposite the side we want to know because of the side angle side that we've we've come up with and now we're just going to do all the work so this gives us 25 minus 24 cosine 30 degrees begging do not subtract those very common if you're going really fast you're stressed out about a test to accidentally subtract those that's not what we're doing this has a product with it and order of operation says you do multiplication before you do addition subtraction so you need to know that first so cosine of 30 degrees that's like square root 3 over 2. for us we can use our calculator and approximate this but if you're going to approximate it take a square root of both sides and put the square root around the whole thing put this in your calculator what not to do don't figure this out then round it then take square root of a rounded number because you're going to be compounding your error so do all the math first let your calculator do the work for you a equals this thing this is the exact amount like this is exactly how long that side is with that angle and these other two sides that's great but it's not as usable as we like so we'll approximate it and we get approximately 2.05 units whatever that is so we've used law of cosines we found out our missing side now what well there's only one more thing we have to find and then we'll use interior angle sum to find the last angle we have to find an angle how we do this is up to you whether you want to use law of cosines or whether you want to use law of sines oh man check this out the one piece of information that was missing for us to use law of sines was that side if we had known that side at the beginning we would have taken sine of an angle over its known opposite equals sine of an angle over its known opposite that would have caused a law of sine situation we could have solved very easily for that angle yeah we would have had two cases that's that's true we don't have that here we won't have that for a law of cosines but at this point you could certainly do law of sines right now you could do law sine of 30 degrees over 2.05 equals sine of c over 3 and you could figure out sine angle c you could do the same thing for angle b that's very very possible on the other hand if you don't like that you don't want to deal with the law of sines again you could use the law of cosines to find a missing angle we just have to really remember that when we're solving for an angle you're you're really using these formulas so if we want to solve for let's say angle c we need to use cosine of angle c uh and what that does is that takes the sides that are adjacent to angle c the opposite side divides them by the product of the sides adjacent so this angle is between those two sides that you know also notice one other thing whether you use law of sines or whether you use law of cosines we can't avoid using this approximation in our math we could if we wanted to use this whole thing it gets really messy but typically we are using an approximation here so i'm going to use the law of cosines i'm going to find angle c so in my head i'm thinking if i want to find angle c it's going to use the adjacent sides and subtract the opposite side squared and divide by the product of 2 times the product of the adjacent sides so cosine of c here's angle c this is what i'm finding i'm going to maybe make a reference here i'm going to square my sides adjacent subtract my side opposite squared and divide by the product of 2 times my adjacent sides that's about it so this is going to give us cosine of c if we want to find what c is we need to take cosine inverse of both sides me personally i would plug all of this in at one time in my calculator i would say that c is cosine inverse of all of this stuff and i would do it just like that i would do cosine inverse put a parenthesis um put a large parenthesis for my numerator here and here plug in my 2.05 squared plus 4 squared minus 3 squared in parenthesis fraction or divide and then put in 2 in parentheses here as well 2 times 2.05 times 4. that way i'm not i'm not doing things like oh round this and write it down then add this and subtract 9 and then write it down and then divide by this written down rounded because you just compound a lot of errors that way so it's best to not round as much as you can until the very very last step and we get that c is approximately 46.9 degrees now if that's 46.9 degrees how do you do the rest of it there there's again two options could you use interior angle sum to figure out angle b absolutely yeah that's totally fine you can do that why well because subtraction doesn't compound the error that you get if you round to the same number so option two is you use the law of cosines again to solve for angle b so you get b equals cosine inverse of all this stuff you'd square 2.05 you'd square three you'd add them you'd subtract 16 divide by 2 times 2.05 times 3 take cosine inverse of that and that's going to give you exactly what angle b is that is actually a great way to check your work so remember interior angle sum has to add to 180. if you use interior angle sum and you find this out what if you were mistaken here if you were it wouldn't show up if you use the law of cosines again to solve for angle b and then you add these things if you've rounded you the same decimal it should add up to exactly 180 degrees so that is a definite good way to check your work me i'm going to just kind of be lazy a little bit and i'm going to use the interior angle sum so 180 degrees minus 30 minus 46.9 is going to give us angle b and we get about 103.1 again if you really wanted to be sure you would have to set this up again law of cosines with angle b you'd have angle well i guess we could write it out angle b would be well cosine inverse you have to take cosine versus both sides let's see the sides adjacent to angle b squared so 2.05 and 3 squared minus the side opposite squared that's what this is telling you here divided by 2 times the sides of json so these same two numbers that's precisely what we had down there remember the three was opposite c just like four is opposite b and this is going to equal if you round to the same decimal place exactly what that is 103.1 degrees i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing the the ideas going through it um one other thing is if you were to use law of sines you could certainly do it here but because that's rounded and you have to use that in a sine inverse it's going to really compound a lot of error also you'll have to deal with the two solutions idea there and only one of them is going to work so this is it can be quite challenging so my encouragement would be use the law of cosines there's not two options here you just get that one and then use either law of cosines again to find the different angle or interior angle sum if you're sure that you got that right interior angle sum would not check your work though where another law of cosines would so i hope that makes sense it's a little bit more straightforward than all signs let's go ahead we'll do a couple more examples and end with an application okay so we have another example we've got a triangle we're not sure if it's a right triangle we know only that we know it's three sides well pythagorean theorem won't help us anyway we already know the three sides and turns out this is not a right triangle it's something where we only have to find our angles now how should you go about finding your angles you have a few options here on how you want to do this number one the side side side knowing all three sides is perfect for law of cosines notice while while notice why law of sines wouldn't work we have no angle and so we would not be able to complete uh one of those fractions with law of sines you have to have a complete fraction equal to half of a completed fraction that's a proportion for you where you solve for one part remember three pieces to find a a fourth for law of sine you need to know either two sides of one angle or two angles on one side and that's that's not what we have here so we have all three sides law of cosines will do that for us but we're only finding of course our angles so this doesn't really work because this is how we find our sides we need to know how to find our angles so here's where the options come in while you have to use law of cosines the first time once you find that angle you could use law of sines now should you i'm going to say probably not most of the time and for a couple reasons when we get there i'll explain to you a little bit more but because the law of sines is going to compound by a sine inverse some of these these errors cosine can do that as well but you don't have to use that in cosine to use law of sines you'd be using a rounded side and the sine inverse is going to make a large difference numerically if you if you're using a rounded number now if you're not then it would be fine the second reason and probably the most important is that with law of sines you get two answers for your angle do you remember that like you have this theta and 180 minus theta you'd at least have to check this only one of them is going to work in law of cosines so there's only one equation that will be true here there's not an ambiguous case but you would have to go through the process to see which one is which and that can be kind of annoying so could you yes should you it depends now i said the beginning like yeah i would normally use law of sines but there and there's a trick i'll show you that you can do but you have to know a lot about it to do it so i'll teach that to you as we're going through so anyway we have this we know three sides idea we know that's a law of cosines let's go ahead and find an angle i'm gonna find let's call this angle a i'm gonna find angle a i'm gonna find the angle opposite the largest side why for a number of reasons number one if it happens to be 90 degrees then i can make a lot of my work easier number two because using the law of sines to find the angle opposite the smaller side the smallest side guarantees you have an acute angle and it guarantees you don't have to check 180 minus theta that's the way i would use law of sines to kind of trick the problem and not have to use law of cosines twice but again you didn't know that i'll explain that as we go through right now so i've labeled this i said if that's a let's call this b and call that c i have three sides i know i'm finding an angle so if i want to find angle a what i'm thinking is i'm going to have cosine of angle a equal to the square of the sides adjacent to it that's four squared and five squared as a sum minus the angle oh sorry minus the side opposite to it so the sides adjacent squared and added minus the side opposite okay so a and opposite over two times the product of the adjacent sides it's two times four times five so we can simplify all that if we want to we can also just use our calculator take cosine inverse and plug it in at one time and we're going to get about 125.1 degrees now what about the other angles so all we've done really is said maybe not a right triangle don't know can't really use anything with it because i'm not sure we know through sides of law of cosines we're finding an angle so great cosine of an angle equals add the squares of the adjacent side subtract the square of the opposite divide by two times the product of the adjacent sides and then take a cosine inverse and we've done that we've got 125.1 degrees one of the rest of them can you use interior angle sum right now to figure out these two angles no no you can't you need to know at least one other angle and then you can do that so what do you do you either do cos law of cosines to find one of these angles doesn't matter which then use law of cosines again or interior angle sum to subtract and figure out what the third one is or i said this i would do this you can use law of sines if you found the largest angle or the the angle opposite the largest side that would be the largest angle why because if you have the smallest side of your triangle it will be opposite an acute angle so when you take sine of that there won't be an obtuse option why because you found the angle opposite the small side it would be an acute angle would be less than 90 degrees that means that you have just one option and the 180 minus theta will not apply so whatever your sine inverse gives you that's your angle that's one way to kind of trick this problem and uh and use it to your advantage so what i would do is i would take sine of 125.1 degrees over eight equals sine of c over four we're going to try that right now sign of known angle over known side equals sine of unknown angle over known side i've completed one fraction i have this equal to another fraction that i know only one part of i know three things i can find a fourth if we multiply by four and take a sine inverse then what we're going to get is c equals four times sine of 125.1 degrees over eight now this is something i told you a little while ago this is dangerous to do why because you've already rounded that and if you're going to use it which i am right now i'm using i probably shouldn't but if i'm using that rounded number this is going to be a little bit off um so c is going to equal really we should have it here too because we're using an approximation c is going to equal an angle that is slightly less accurate than you could get with law of cosines this is maybe a little bit faster but it is less accurate if i knew what that angle was exactly i would for sure use law of sines so that's kind of the caveat to what i was explaining a little earlier would i do loft signs yeah if i was sure about that angle i knew exactly what it was because that's a little faster for me i like dealing with proportions i'm more comfortable with them than remembering law of cosines although it's not all that bad so that that's the that's the caveat so if you want to use law of sines you need to know one angle perfect and then you're finding the angle opposite the smaller side because sine of this angle it has to be acute you don't have two options so we would get 24.1 degrees approximately so this is about 24.1 now let's say that you were actually given an angle like here then law of sines would work just fine as long as you're finding the um the angle that's opposite your smallest side so that that's kind of the necessary thing otherwise otherwise what would we have to do if we didn't know this was a cube if we didn't know it was the angle across from the smallest side which has to be an acute angle then we would have two options here the angle and 180 minus angle you have to go through the process of figuring out which one of those is right there would be only one but it's kind of annoying to have to do that now what what if you don't like that what if you don't like the ambiguity of it you want to use law of cosines that's totally fine if we take and find angle c let's pretend we didn't know is 24.1 and we want to do law of cosines we're going to do the same exact thing and notice that there's no rounded numbers in that so cosine of angle c equals take the squares of the adjacent side the sides next to that square it subtract the side opposite it squared over two times the product of the adjacent sides that i might be messing these up a little bit but it does not matter as long as you're the concept of it's right if you're trying to find angle c we're just going to verify that it's 24.1 right now if you want to find angle c then your adjacent sides are five and eight your opposite side is four square everything subtract the four squared divide by two times the adjacent sides and then take a cosine inverse now first glance you're you might be thinking you're getting exactly the same thing but notice something this is actually an approximation from here because you you act well actually really here because you use an approximation this just happens to be exactly what you get around the same decimal place as this but you would be more exact here you could get exactly what you want to as many decimal places as you want because you did not use any rounded figures so that is that's more appropriate if you're going to use something rounded here if you're not then law of sines is perfect you can do it just find the angle opposite the smallest side it works just fine for us this is going to be 24.1 degrees approximately once we round which is what we get by the law of sines now consequently because we know both of these angles you can use interior angle sum to figure out this one you could also use the law of cosines one more time but it's it's really up to you at this point i'm going to use interior angle sum and say the angle b is 180 degrees minus 24.1 minus 25.1 we get the angle b is approximately 30.8 degrees by the interior angle sum man i hope i'm making this make sense i hope you're seeing how the law of cosines it could give you something a little bit more exact if you use an approximation i hope you're also seeing though that you can use law of sines here it is okay but you must use law of cosines to figure out your first angle or with the side angle side you must use your law of cosines to figure out your your other side that gives you the ability to use law of sines later or continue with law of cosines either one is fine as long as you're remembering that rounded numbers really decrease your accuracy so avoid using them if at all possible so maybe on this one if you had the choice i'd use log law of cosines because it is a little bit more exact in its in its essence so let's come back i'm going to do one more example with you we'll give a real life example or at least an application and then we'll be done okay last one before an application we got this triangle it's clearly not a right triangle so we can't use any sort of things like pythagorean theorem to find that missing side even though we might want to can't do it can't use right triangle trigonometry so what are we left with well we could be trying to use interior angle sum if we note another tri angle we certainly could do that we can't use pythagorean theorem so we're left with law of sines or law of cosines think through it don't just do law of cosines because we're in the section or the video or whatever you're doing think about what we're really asking so what would what would really work could you even set up a law of sines and make it make sense law of sines requires you to know an angle and one side opposite to it in order to even use it so here's an angle i don't know that side here's a side i don't know the angle here's the side i don't know the angle law of sines is done like you cannot use that with side side side you had no angles so you cannot use that that means we rely on law of cosines law of cosines says that for a side an angle and a side or two sides and an angle between them we can solve it and so let's start labeling some things again if you like the formulas then you can label this with letters like everywhere you do that so this is maybe a and then little a uh if this is b then this would be lowercase b if this is c then this is lowercase letter c that would be fine if you're the type of person who likes to label things like that that's okay i i like i like a label i'm more of a concept guy when it comes to formulas though so when i think about the formula what i'm thinking is with my side angle side what could i what could i even find right now could i find an angle right now really think through this in order to find an angle you need to know the adjacent sides that's the only way that that our our formulas actually work so if if i want to find angle a i would have to know this side and the set and i don't if i wanted to find angle c i would have to know this side and this side and i don't why because in finding your your angles uh you have to actually have to know all three sides you'd have to know all of your sides for the a squared plus the b squared minus the c squared over 2 times a b you have to know all of them and so i don't know all my sides so i can't find any of my angles i have to find a side first this last remaining side so i'm going to do that i'm going to find side b how does it work finding out the side says think pythagorean theorem if i'm finding out that side i'm going to take my other two sides and square them subtract two times the product of those sides times cosine of the angle between them which consequently is the opposite angle to that side so finding that side says add these two sides square them we'll add the squares of the size you should say subtract 2 times those two sides and cosine of the angle between which is the opposite angle to the side you want to find now we're going to plug in some numbers so b squared is well let's see 3 squared 2 squared minus 2 times 2 times 3 times cosine of 110 degrees if we really wanted to be fancy take a square root of the whole thing do it all at one time on your calculator so i just happened to simplify it at 9 4 12 cosine 110 you don't have to you can just take a square root right from here put the whole thing in as long as you use your parentheses appropriately b is about 4.1 units that's great okay so now now what do we do you have some options on what you you want to do you can either use law of cosines again or you can use law of sines which should you do it really it depends on what you're given um and it depends on what you're going to find if you are given the largest angle and you've found the largest side which you have then if you want to use law of sines use it to find the angle that's opposite the smallest side here's why for the last time that with your law of sines you remember that you have two options two two options an angle and 180 minus an angle if you know that you are an angle opposite the smallest side that's what you're finding that will be an acute angle it will be less than 90 so you don't have to worry about this other one 180 minus your angle is going to be obtuse you don't have to worry about that you know you're acute so it's 0 to 90 degrees that's an acute angle so if that's the case then you know for sure that that's a cute there's only one case there and you can do a law of sines so sine of c over 2 equals sine of well there's only one other complete fraction you have and but notice you are using the rounded number now what about using angle code law of cosines to find angle a you'd still be using a rounded number so no matter what unless you plug in this entire piece for for either formula you're going to be using something rounded in later math not the best option but it is really typically what we do here so i can show you both of them i'll show you law of sines and then i'll show you law of cosines so so law of sines says you know one complete fraction you know an angle and a site opposite to it and i'm going to find the angle that's opposite my smallest side i know it's acute that gives me this non two options idea i would cross multiply or i can just multiply both sides by two and take an inverse sine inverse of both sides so c is sine inverse imagine this multiply both sides by two you would get 2 side 110 over 4.14 and then you would take a sine inverse of both sides that's what i would plug in my calculator i wouldn't write down little numbers or anything plug the whole thing in i got like 26.997 and i rounded it to 27. please do this make everyone happy when you do this by the way when you round something if you round to 27 but you've rounded to get there put 27 point whatever 27.0 to show that like this put 27.0 so that it shows you rounded to get there if you just put 27 without the point zero even though the point zero doesn't mean anything numerically it means something rounding wise this will show people you rounded to get there if you put exactly 27 without the decimal point 0 it seems like that's a whole number it seems like that was an exact answer so don't do that that's why you put the point 0 even though 27 would be counted as the same thing now that's law of sines law of cosines would say hey if you want to find angle c here's how we do it we take cosine of c square this square the sides adjacent to it and add them subtract the side opposite to it squared divide by two times the product of the the adjacent sides to whatever angle you're finding exactly that then we're going to take cosine inverse okay i want you to know that i have a slight mistake on the board right now this and this are technically still approximations because i've used an approximation in it i know i'm reiterating myself a lot but it's very important that you understand something we get out of using an approximation is also an approximation it can't automatically become exact somehow so those really should all be approximations and what i got out of that was 27.0 degrees if i rounded but i wonder if you noticed something if you did both of these this was like 26.99 something this was 26.9 and a different something it was slightly different so i think 26.96 but it was slightly different that is because we used an approximation when we did our math so cosine and sine will take that approximation and and it will deal differently with the error in that um so rounded wise it usually works out as long as you're not really super rounding that number it's typically pretty fine but i do want to point it out to you so which way is better if you're rounding it doesn't make much of a difference if you're looking to be as exact as possible don't use a round number if you didn't use a rounded number here and you use this exact thing this expression in both of your equations they would come out exactly the same so i hope that's made sense i hope that you've seen that you really do need to solve use law of cosines to solve for that missing side after that you have options you can do law of sines you can do law of cosines law of cosines is preferred for two reasons number one sometimes it lets you not use rounded numbers while signs will not do that if you if you're working on this type of triangle secondly is that law of cosines doesn't make you use the two options like law of sines does the only way around that is to do what i've shown you and find the angle opposite the shortest side with law of sines that would avoid your two options because you know you're an acute angle after this because you know that angle c is about 27.0 degrees you can use interior angle sum that's fine you could use law of sines if you wanted to that'd be fine you could use law of cosines again with a with to find angle a that's also fine i'm going to use interior angle sum uh at this point it's not going to compound any more errors we already have that error built in so it wouldn't compound that and so we would get angle a is 180 minus 110 minus 27.0 and finally angle a is approximately 43.0 degrees i hope this made sense we're going to come back and do one uh real life example and see if if we can put blob cosines to good work okay last example so let's pretend you are flying uh you're flying from city a to city b i've never visited city b but i hear it's wonderful this time of year city a whatever um and you're chugging along you see a little readout you're going about 220 miles an hour and it takes 330 miles to get from city to fly from city a to cdb and after 15 minutes your pilot discovers ah man i've been going 10 degrees off course maybe didn't account for a crosswind or something and he's been going off course a little bit so there's a couple questions firstly what course does he correction does he have to make at 15 minutes after he left city a and secondly how long is it going to take to get there or what speed does he have to adjust to get there in a certain amount of time both of those questions are things we can answer so let's start with with this if you have this type of a triangle is there a way that you could you do anything right now without knowing more information not really remember you need to know three things in order to find a fourth you know only two you know an angle in one side there's nothing in triangles that we can deal with only knowing two things in a right triangle you automatically know one angle is 90 degrees so it'll be three things that you know so here it's no you can't have they give another information that we can use yeah it says that you detected an error after flying this way for 15 minutes if you're going 220 miles an hour for 15 minutes or a quarter of an hour remember that distance equals rate times time if distance equals rate times time then if we travel 220 miles an hour for a quarter of an hour not 15. you didn't go for 15 hours so make sure your units match here 15 minutes is 0.25 hours that would be 55 miles so we now know a second side of this triangle well that's nice now we have a lot more we have three pieces of information let's see what it fits does this fit a right triangle model um do we do we know it's a right triangle no and so we really can't use right triangular trigonometry can we use law of sines law of sines requires you to know an angle and one side opposite it in order to do anything with it i know an angle but i don't know the opposite side i know a side i don't know the opposite angle i know the side i don't know opposite angles so law of sines will not work if you really look at it there's two sides and an angle known between it that right there is what we can deal with with law of cosines so we're certainly in law of cosines what do you do with law of cosines well you really can't find an angle until you know all three sides why finding an angle requires you to know the adjacent side so if i wanted to find this angle i'd have to know both of these sides if i wanted to find this angle i'd have to know both of these sides i'm missing this side we have to find that side first so let's call this side a if you want to label everything then this would be angle c side c side b we already have angle a and angle b now our law of cosines is going to tell us what to do we're trying to solve for this side so a squared equals whether you want to use your formula or not conceptually or or just kind of copy it down either way is really fine typically your given formula but conceptually is a little bit nicer for me because it helps me to memorize things so if i'm trying to find a side i think by failure and theorem i think okay a squared equals the sum of the other two sides squared well the sum of the squares of the two sides so 330 squared and 55 squared the formula would tell you b squared plus c squared minus 2 times their product of what you just squared and cosine of the angle between them so cosine of 10 degrees or the angle opposite the side you want to find so let's see here's my side i want to find i have some of the squares of these other two sides minus the product of two times those sides times cosine of the angle between them which is also the angle opposite the side i need to find so if we take a square root of that entire expression and do not round it this a is exactly that now that's not very useful if we think well i want to know what the distance is and be able to do some distance rate time on it so we're going to approximate that so we get almost exactly 276 miles like 276.00 something miles so we now know that if you're flying for 55 miles 15 minutes going 225 miles 220 miles an hour then at that point you are exactly 276 miles away from your destination this wonderful glorious city be now what do you do after that well we want to know a couple things one thing we want to know is what's this course correction what angle do you have to adjust to what that's going to take is us knowing what angle c is and subtracting that angle from 180 degrees to know what adjustment we need to make so we probably ought to find that angle do we care about this angle no not so much not really at all actually so let's use law of cosines you could certainly use a law of sines so sine of c over 330 equals sine of 10 over 276 now that you know it but be careful because this is the longest side of your triangle hope you're listening because that's the longest side of your triangle this is going to be your largest angle this will be an obtuse angle this will be um but in other triangles you can't guarantee that here you can because it's such a small angle so law of sines in a lot of cases would not be preferable because you'd have two options so you could certainly do it i'm going to choose to do law of cosines though because i want to avoid the two options outcome that i'd have to go through so it's kind of frustrating so i'm going to do law of cosines and think i want to find angle c okay how does that work when you're finding an angle it says you need to know the adjacent sides square them and add them that'd be 55 and 276.0 squared each you need to know the opposite side which we know it's 330. and we're going to divide by 2 times the product of the adjacent sides these two should always show up right there if we take cosine inverse of that entire mess of junk we're going to get whatever this angle is which is about 168.0 degrees again we rounded but it rounded to point zero so we're going to show that that's this angle please don't get confused that's this angle not this one so this is 168.0 degrees then what's your course correction well if that's 168 a straight angle has 180 degrees these two angles are supplementary let's subtract 180 minus 168 is approximately 12.0 degrees so this guy's going along at 220 miles an hour after 15 minutes or 55 miles he says oh man i got to make a correction what's the distance the distance to my destination is 276 miles the course correction i need to make judging from my my math that we did here is a 12 degree course correction now how fast does this guy have to go if he wants to make the entire trip 90 minutes still an hour and a half 1.5 hours well here's one thing that students would often do they'd say oh well if i'm here and i need to go that far because distance equals rate times time rate equals distance divided by time so can't i just take 276 and divide it by 90 minutes or 1.5 hours no what why because you already burned up 15 minutes remember if you if you want to make your entire trip 1.5 hours you already pointed boined up you already boiled up maybe the city b is boston you already burned up 2.25 hours of this so you only have 1.25 hours left hopefully that makes sense to you maybe it doesn't maybe i can re-explain a little bit you discovered after 15 minutes or a quarter of an hour that you are here you have that far to go if you're traveling 220 miles an hour and you want to make your entire trip 90 minutes that is you're here you only have 75 minutes left to get here so this distance divided by 75 minutes or 1.25 hours would give you your speed so rate equals distance over time i have that far to go i have 1.25 hours left to get there that is 75 minutes because i burned up my first 15 minutes if you need to get there from a to b in 90 minutes you have to pick it up a little bit how far uh or how fast so 276 divided by 1.25 says you're going to have to increase your speed to 220.8 miles per hour so increase it just a little bit more and you will make it there right on time whole trip all together after burning 15 minutes going wrong direction would be still 90 minutes if you increased at this point to 220.8 miles an hour hope it's made sense i hope you're seeing uh law of cosines and i've explained it well enough for you i hope you see when you can use law of sines a lot of the times law of cosines is a better option especially if you don't completely understand the two solution idea of all signs just stick with law of cosines you'll be absolutely fine in fact it helps you check your work so that's about it for this video i hope you're enjoying them next time we'll talk about the area of a triangle and how in the world you can use it when you know certain cases like the law of cosines without having to find a height explicitly so we'll deal with that next time you
