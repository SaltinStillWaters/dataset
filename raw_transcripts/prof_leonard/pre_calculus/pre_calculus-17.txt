Transcript for: The Square Root Method in Solving Quadratics (Precalculus - College Algebra 17)
hey welcome to another video in this video we're gonna start learning about the techniques that we generally use of solve quadratics and there's four of them and last video I introduced that I said we're going to be talking about four techniques coming up I'm gonna teach these to you in the order in which you should look for them so I'm going to teach you them and the the easiest to the I don't say most difficult but the ones that involve a little bit more work guess that means more difficult so we're going to talk about the square root method first then we'll talk about factoring then we'll talk about completing the square and we use that to transition into the quadratic formula so when we're doing this remember what we're doing we're gonna all have quadratics and they're all gonna be parabolas and we're basically looking to see if these are going to cross the x-axis and if they do where and if they don't do they balance do they touch or do they completely miss it and have imaginary numbers so that's what we're discussing we're gonna talk about the square root method first why it works so nicely lights the first one that you check so what the square root method asks is can I find the x-intercepts are the zeros or the roots of my quadratic by taking a square root of both sides so the screw method does basically two things it sets the function equal to zero and it says can i isolate in power too with having without having any X's anywhere else in the function if I can do that then we can take a square root of both sides the biggest thing that I can possibly tell you here is that number one we need to be able to I guess it's two Biggie's things number one meeting about people we need to be able to identify when we can do the square root method and when we can't number two and I swear this is the biggest thing when you take a square root on your paper it wasn't there before and you're the one who put it on there with very few exceptions you have to have a plus and minus right for that square root that's important because what that does and we learned last video is that these are going to generally have two solutions are you going to see that on that one that we're only gonna get one solution out of but we're gonna get the same solution twice in order to get that you have to have a plus a minus in front of that square root I promise you it's the biggest mistake that I see students make especially like an intermediate algebra class and I know this is precalculus but the same mistakes still happen so let's get let's dive right into it let's see what the square root method is when it works and and how did how to do it so number one hey do we have a parabola yeah and in fact that's an upward-opening problem all of these are going to be it's not a big deal if we don't have upward-opening that work the same way but what we do every single time we want to find zeros or solve a quadratic or find out where across the x axis is we set our function equal to zero so we're gonna do that we're gonna stay let's make x squared minus 18 equal to zero now when we go ahead and we solve this go well how would we do it that is the kind of the nature of deciding what technique to use so here's a thought process I really want to build in your head in order to do these the most efficiently way possible so when we look at this we go well will a square root method or will the square root work the answer that question lies in can you get something all wrapped up in parenthesis or just an X or something with a power two on one side that contains all of your X's and a constant on the other side if we can do that taking a square root will work if not then we have to have another technique typically we would try factoring second then we go probably to the quadratic formula I'll show you completing the square but pretty much as a way to get to quadratic formula so we look at it I got x squared minus 18 equals zero y equals zero because I'm trying to figure out where this function has a height of 0 and therefore if or where it cross the x-axis that's given us our zeros well I've done that now the second thing I ask in my head is can I get a power to by itself I see an X to the power 2 I see that that I can isolate this if I add 18 on both sides that would get everything on one side having a power 2 I'll wrap up in that exponent and then a constant other this is what we're looking for we're looking to get some power to with all of your X's inside and a constant on the other side that's important that's the nature of the Scruton that works then you're good to go screwed man that's gonna work you take a square root on both sides why well anytime you have a power to we know that to undo a power to the inverse of that is a square root we've just got to do it on both sides and you go sweet I'm God no no this is gonna make you teacher cry it's make this me literally made me cry not really made me cry but like my heart breaks a little more whenever we do this we need to understand what square roots do square roots when we square a number it takes negatives and it makes them positive and it takes positive it keeps them positive because of that because these these power twos have the ability both 3 and negative 3 and make them both positive 9 or any two numbers that are opposites and make them the same numbers output we need to acknowledge that by saying you know what whether I have a positive square root of 18 or a negative square root of 18 if I square positive square root of 18 it's gonna give me 18 if I square negative square root of 18 it's going to give me 18 but both of those values satisfy this this x squared equals 18 I can plug in I can plug in square root of 18 here square of 18 squared is 18 18 minus 18 0 I can plug in negative squared of 18 here and it's kind of weird to think about but the square root the negative square root of 18 squared well squaring and negative gives me a positive square root 18 square root of 18 gives me 18 if I plug in the negative square root of 18 squared I'm gonna get 18 18 minus 18 is 0 it says both of these and there are two both of those solutions are valid for this that's why we have to put both the plus and minus it gives us the two solutions that we know we're going to get for quadratics in general whatever that highest power is whatever your degree is that's how many solutions you're in general gonna get for a polynomial weird so for here we know we're going to get two solutions we have to have the plus and minus to show is that so what happens well let's see the square root of x squared gives us X on the right hand side we do need to still know how to simplify some square we need to be able to take a submarine you know what square root of 18 I could write that as 9 times 2 I know the square root of 9 gives us 3 the square root of 2 says I can't you know what I can't really simplify that anymore that's a prime number I can't make make it a power 2 to simplify the power of the root I know that I would get plus or minus 3 square root 2 now for my students I have them write this out every single time so that they don't think that this is just one solution what I have them do this is okay now I need you to write this as x equals 3 square root 2 and another solution x equals negative 3 square root 2 this is the fundamental idea of the square root method you're saying you know what I still want to find x-intercepts I'm still going to set this equal to 0 but then we look at what the best technique is are there other ways to do it yeah there are is this the easiest probably for me it's the easiest for a lot of students as easiest especially when I start getting some of these things the screwed math is extremely nice when we can use it again the fundamental problem the fundamental idea for having the screwed method is can I get a power two on one side that contains all of my X's like this next word and a constant on the other side if I can do that take a square root on both sides put a plus and minus around your constant so square root of your constant put a plus a minus there you don't need on both sides because it's redundant if we forget we don't need that so take a square root of both sides and put a plus or minus in front of your square root of constant simplify your square root and then you're gonna have to sum most of the time you're going to have two solutions well it let's look at that what are those solutions this should tell you something does this say that we cross the x-axis twice does it say that we balance off the x-axis once does it say that we missed the x-axis and here's how did it how to determine that in the last video we talked about the only three cases we can have where we cross we balance the vertex bounces or touches the x-axis or we completely miss it how to determine that if you have two distinct solutions like these these are different numbers here they are numbers you can plug them into your calculator it's going to some sort of a decimal on your x-axis where this parabola actually crosses so if you have two distinct numbers usually a pop well I can't say usually a positive negative they can both be positive and both be negative but two distinct numbers that do not have eyes in them then you are going to cross the x axis twice and this is giving you two zeros or two real x-intercepts that's what it's talking that's what it's talking about if we get one real solution so no lies but you get basically the same number twice they're not distinct that means that you're bouncing you're touching you're bouncing the vertex right of that x axis and if you get eyes anywhoo hair in these problems any sort of an imaginary number any sort of a complex number that means that you're missing the x axis so right here we look at this we got right hey I have a I'm going to solve for zero as said this equals zero I must find my x-intercepts I'm doing that I'm saying the square root method works great because they get isolated power tooth on the X isn't a constant on the other side I'm taking the square root of acknowledging I must have a plus some is a big deal and then I'm simplified as much as possible and then say yes these are two numbers they're different numbers and they don't have ice in them that means that we have two real zeros two x-intercepts let's let's do a few more we're going to run through these fairly quickly the ideas that I'm looking for are that you understand number one that we're setting a function equal to zero to find x-intercepts number two whether we use this technique or any other technique for solving quadratics we're getting the same thing we're finding those zeros number three when you man when you set this equal to zero you need to understand when the the square root method works and then how to do it so when it works is when I can get a power to by itself constantly side how or just taking a square root of both sides and you put any plus and minus and turn the square root of your constant so let's set this equal to zero and we're saying alright that's going to let us find any x-intercepts by setting the height of the function equal to zero now we think can I get the this something this power to by itself on one side and a constant on the other side if I can do that so without any other exits floating around if I can do that well then I can take a square root of both sides but what I say that means is that there's no addition buddies no multiplication buddies no nothing just something to the second power so when we solve this figure all right let's let's add 33 I'm noticing that I just have an x squared I'm gonna be able to get that by itself but man you really have to get it by itself this is not good enough I see a lot of students go on Janice yeah I can take a square root I'm gonna get it here and then take a square root please don't do that it's making a tremendous amount of work and it's not right because if we take a square root around 3 x squared the square root of 3 is very hard to deal with so instead of doing that what we're gonna do we're gonna divide by 3 we're gonna get that second power there's something to the second power that X and same power or or parenthesis to the second power get that isolated so let's divide by 3 so dividing both sides by 3 we get this x squared equals a lemon this is what we mean by isolating a a power 2 we mean that I have all of my X's inside something being squared yeah there's only one X so that is ice and empowered to you and have a constant on the other side no other X's anywhere to be found this is perfect this says our square root methods gonna work so when we do that we take a square root of both sides and we think you know what in taking and taking a square root and solving for x we're understanding that a power to takes is both a positive and a negative solution that makes them positive so in understanding that we're saying you know what the square root of 11 is a solution here but the negative square root of 11 is also a solution because if I take square root of 11 and square it would give me 11 so until you hear and say hey square root of 11 squared is 11 or the negative square root of 11 squared it's also lemon so to understand that that that means that we're understanding why we're putting the plus and minus y all right I'm gonna put this here because both the positive and negative version the opposites of this solution well they would both satisfy this equation so how are two in a square root those are inverse on the right hand side we can't simplify the square root of live and there's nothing to do with this what we are gonna write it as the positive square root of 11 and the negative square root of 11 and now I want you to think in your head are these two real x-intercepts are we going to cross the x-axis twice are we going to balance off the x-axis with the vertex or are we missing it well are there any eyes no are these unique yes so they're not the same answer twice this means that this problem which is upward-opening positive it's going to cross the x-axis two times at exactly the square root of 11 and a negative square root of 11 these are called exact solutions so when you don't approximate you don't plug in the square root of 11 and you calculate or find a decimal that's what they mean by giving me an exact solution this is exact no exact us sometimes does it make sense he's like well I don't know what that is exactly no one does no one does because you don't know what the square root of 11 is forever because it goes forever without repeating it's not a fractions it's not rational so when we say accept we wrap it up in a form that contains all the information like the square root of 11 it says okay this is what the number is an approximation would be where you put in your calculator you go okay this is like three points something that's an approximation so when they ask you for approximation yet put in your calculator if not these are exact solutions and this is exactly where this parabola that's upper opening would cross two times the x axis that's what we're doing okay moving on we have four more to do these two are special cases that I need to show you so really there's just these two they need to make sure that you completely understand and then we're we're practically done we'll talk about those ones you kind of need I want to show you the other other cases because these are all real solution up to this point so we have a function G of x equals x plus 2 squared minus 1 you know what one of the the first things that people really want to do here is distribute because yeah let's just let's let's foil that all out or whatever you want to do that might not be the best thing when we go through solving quadratics the first thing I need to understand is that solving means setting equal to 0 to find x-intercepts roots or zeros so solving says I'm going to take my function I'm going to say fine the x value or values where my height is 0 this is inherently spying out where we cross the x-axis now categorize this can you and go through the steps can you solve this by using the square root method if the answer is yes then you should do it if the answer is no then we try to factor it then if you can't do that then we try to do quadratic formula which always works but it's a little bit more tedious so we think can we do the easiest things first that's why there's 4 techniques because some are easier but don't work all the time some work all the time but there's more tedious so we look at this and go right on find out where the height is zero and find out where this crosses the x-axis bounces or if it misses how to solve this well we're thinking about it going can i isolate a power to so that all my X's are within that power to make it just like here just like here can i isolate this so that all my X's are within the power two and have a constant without X's on the other side yes yeah I can if I add one to both sides X plus two squared equals one this is isolated a power to that contains all of my X's there's no other X's being added subtracted multiplied dividing no X's over here next to that constant was once constant this is when the square root method shines because it's a to stand land like a three step process we do this we go right now that I've isolated the power to know if it is building around I can take a square root because I know what we can do basically whatever you want in equations as long as we do it to both sides so we say how planned route I do a power to take a square root just do it to both sides and recognize that anytime you put a square root on your paper you have to do a plus or minus in front of the square root of your constant this is saying that when I plug this number in I would get a positive and I would get a negative but squaring that is going to give me that positive one no matter what so this is this is why we do that on the left hand side hey the square root of a squared those are inverses you basically just compose them and it cancels out so that's X plus 2 equals plus or minus the square root of simplify the square roots so the square root of one is one so we have plus or minus one let's get a little confusing for students what how the world do you solve this we're gonna solve for X and we're gonna solve for x by subtracting two but it's important where we subtract that to where we subtract it to should not be like this we shouldn't subtract two here and subtract two from the one why well because that stands for two different numbers that stands for positive 1 and negative 1 and if I subtract 2 from it one of those would be right and one of them will be wrong so here's what I would like you to do this kind of trains you a little bit for the next few problems instead of writing this out as what you could do that this is perfectly acceptable instead of writing this out as X plus 2 equals positive 1 and X plus 2 equals negative 1 you can certainly do that you can solve each one independently and it will give you the correct solution that's a fine way to do it what I'm gonna try to get you to do is to do this say alright if I subtract 2 maybe put it in front of that plus and minus so we get x equals negative 2 plus or minus 1 and the reason why is because that looks a little bit more like what we're going to get on quadratic formula that looks a little bit more like we're gonna get when we complete the square it's gonna kind of flow through this and looks a little bit more like what we're going to get right here so the reason why so that you can start to to train your mind that this is two solutions how do we get both solutions well if we go and take our constant negative 2 and we add 1 so kind of a highroad negative 2 plus 1 and then take the low road negative 2 minus 1 that's going to yield both of those solutions for us so let's look at a man that's now we can understand this this is negative 1 and this is negative 3 so negative 2 plus 1 is negative 1 maybe 2 minus 1 is negative 3 in your head right now you should be thinking this is a parabola shirts have a power to is it upward opening yeah in fact this is a shift look at this the zip shook down 1 this making sense that is ship left - so down down one left - this should be upward-opening it should have two exhibitions down one left - wait a minute those Exeter ships are probably negative how they are this is exactly where this parabola crosses the x-axis how do we know that crosses doesn't balance we know it doesn't balance because these are different numbers we know it crosses because they're not imaginary numbers so this is two x-intercepts where this parabola that's upward opening crosses the x axis you know what we can plug it and see they both work so we plug in negative 1 negative 1 plus 2 is 1 1 squared is 1 1 minus 1 is 0 oh yeah ok if I plug this and I get a height of 0 that means it's on the acceptance plug in negative 3 negative 3 plus 2 is negative 1 wait that's the same number we just got but it's as up as a sign those are opposites but negative 1 squared is positive 1 and 1 minus 1 is 0 this is the reason why you must have that plus and minus that plus or minus gives you the ability to say okay one of our solutions is positive but square its Square to keep it positive one of our solutions when we plug in some numbers here this would be negative but the squares gonna make it positive that's why we need that plus a minus to maintain that idea I hope this making sense I hope you're seeing that we have three examples where we are actually crossing the x-axis because we don't have imaginary numbers and we have two distinct numbers let's try the last one before we get in some special cases same thing I'm going to walk through it fairly quickly we go all right this is a quadratic how do we know if you were to distribute it you'd have an X to the second power that is a quadratic I want to find X intercepts the first thing we do whenever we want to find x-intercepts is set your function equal to zero no matter what function you have and now we categorize it so we've said quadratic sure I'm thinking in my head what I should be getting I'm thinking I should either cross twice bounce once or miss completely then I'm saying how do I find those those values well I said it the function equals ur I've done that now in my head I'm thinking parabola I'm thinking okay now what technique do I use do I jump directly to quadratic form you know that's a tremendous amount work we had to distribute combine my terms find a B and C put it in a formula and the head go through it that's that's not super fun is there an easier way yes so we start with the easiest way and see if that'll work the easiest technique we have is a square root method can we solve this or can we isolate my guess is a better word a power to with a constant on the other side so something that has all of our X's in iteration of the second power and a constant their side answers yeah this already has a power to and that's a constant there's no other X's that are outside of that parenthesis outside of that thing that's being raised to the second power that's what we're looking for something that contains your X's raised to the second power so if we had if we have that we can isolate the power to then we do it one thing I want to mention right now just just glanced at it for a second what if we would have had something like a 4 out here and a 4 out here before you take a square root you would have to divide by 4 please see that please see that when we talk about taking the square root just like right here it's why I gave it to you just like right here before you take a square root you actually have to have the thing raised to the second power completely isolated nothing around it at all be multiplied added or subtracted or divided so if we had the four yeah we say yeah I can still ask the power too but it's a two-step process add 32 here you'd be dividing by 4 you would not take a square root right now now okay all right because now that we have the square oscillating if we take a square root on both sides and we think every time I take a square root I'm gonna do a plus and minus y because squares maintain positivity for both negative and positive values that's what that's why I'm doing that on the left-hand side Tower matches the root working at 2x plus 3 on the right hand side we're gonna simplify the square root of 32 as much as possible 32 is 16 times 2 so we can take the square that notice I'm picking the it's number I can take the square root of not smallest so I'm not thinking for eight because if I did four and eight I'd have to do this process twice once with 32 and then we'd have a sort of eight do it again so I'm thinking what's the biggest perfect square that I can simplify out of this and be sixteen square root of 16 is 4 the square root of 2 is I don't know let's leave so we have looked this we've said I'm going to set equal zero then we've categorized it we thought I can isolate the power to square method work is just fine I'm gonna fully isolate this if I would have numbers in front I'd still divide them I have 32 I'm gonna take a square root I understand that anytime I take a square root I'm adding that plus and minus there I'm simplifying the radical that we did and then we continue to solve for X and doing that we're gonna use what I taught you up here we're gonna say where would I subtract the 3 well because I trained you right here we're not gonna try to subtract the 3 from us from a radical it doesn't work this has a square root 2 this doesn't they're not like radicals that we learn about and like an intermediate algebra class we can't subtract those things so where we put the minus 3 is in front of that plus and minus that's why I showed you this so we've understand how to how do I organize a problem here so when we subtract the 3 we have 2 x equals negative 3 plus or minus 4 square root 2 so we're just solving for x if this had been any other number we'd be subtracting 3 do the same thing just know where to put it we put it in front of that plus and minus lastly we know that we're gonna divide by 2 we do this for any type of problem solving for x where you have 2x is part of it we divide by 2 do the same thing we need to find the whole entire expression by 2 so our X dividing both sides by 2 would equal negative 3 plus or minus 4 square root 2 and then all divided by 2 I need to make a couple notes you should be making a couple of notes here that number one things need to be simplified so that means our square root needs to be simplified this expression would need to be simplified if possible I want to man you gotta pay attention this please don't miss this there's things you can do and things you can't do when simplifying what you can't do don't simplify little pieces of this fraction you cannot simplify the fourth of two it's impossible yeah if this had been like a number like six you can't simplify just the six of the two that's impossible what you can do if it's possible to factor or if these have a common factor of in your in these two terms and if that simplifies with the two what you can do bear with me here for a second if this had been a number like six I know it's not they just bear with me if they have been a number like six this is something you must simplify so we'd say how would you do that there's kind of an easy way that doesn't really show you what's going on now I'm going to talk about that one so what most people do and then I'll talk about why it is that that works what most people do is they go right divide each of these three numbers not that one divide each of these three numbers by two and that actually works so you all right 6 divided by 2 is 3 4 divided by 2 is 2 2 divided by 2 is 1 and you can simplify like that why that works is because if you would have something that has a common factor you could factor it out so if we factor out the 2 from negative 6 and for factoring out the 2 and give you let's see negative 6 divided by 2 is negative 3 4 divided by 2 is 2 and we'd have this 2 on the denominator then you can simplify that away that's why it works it's a factoring idea we know how to simplify fractions it's a factoring idea that works the same if you just divide all three of these numbers by the same number so that doesn't work be careful with that what what I see is students make mistakes and it'll justify two numbers you cannot do that that's it that's another the last thing I need to mention to you before you know special cases is that that I would really like it if you would make sure you understand that these are two solutions so I'm gonna have you write it like that I'm going to understand that this means negative three plus four root two over two that's one solution and x equals negative three minus 4 root 2 over 2 that's another solution why do we have two of them because we didn't forget our plus and minus now last thing the very last thing what do those mean to you is that a parabola yes is this crossing the x-axis twice is it bouncing once or is it completely missing it don't let weird looking answers give you the wrong impression of what's going on so here's how to think through it are those different answers yes so we know that we're not bouncing get that we know we're not bouncing because we need to get the same answer twice we have negative three plus and a three minus two different numbers so that means that we have two different solutions so it's not bouncing we know we're not in that vertex on the x axis idea do we have any imaginary numbers do we have any eyes up here no so even though they look weird these are two real solutions this is exactly these are exact solutions exactly where this parabola will cross the x axis these are x-intercepts the real solution they don't have eyes and they're not imaginary there's not just one of them they didn't happen the same same value twice we have two distinct solutions and they are exact they look really weird because we don't we couldn't go right now most of us can't go right now I can't do it and go oh that's that's that's here on x-axis I need a calculator now we need to plug this in and do negative 3 plus 4 squared or 2 and then divide that by 2 but think about it would it give you a decimal would it give you some number with decimals in it that you could go to the x-axis and plot yes because it doesn't have eyes what that means is that this really is a real solution this is giving you two spots on the x-axis where this parabola will be crossing it that's what I need you to know now let's move on to the next next couple examples so I told you a couple times that what we're looking is really three cases would we cross twice where we bounce once and where we completely miss we've done a lot of cross twice that happens a lot this is going to be a a bounce this is gonna be able touch at one time and then show you why in the in the form of this why that happens and this is going to be a we completely mess so I'm not going to hold you in suspense that's what's going to happen let's see why that happens and why it is that the the plus and minus doesn't always yield two distinct solutions so let's take a look at this f of X equals X minus 7 squared man is it a parabola yeah and if we distributed that we would see that that would have an x squared in it is it upward-opening yeah that that's positive is it shifted yes in fact if you really think about this this is not shifted up or down this is shifted to the right 7 units and suffered opening weight if we had a parabola whose vertex naturally is at 0 0 and we just shift it to the right 7 units isn't that vertex still gonna be on the x-axis yeah is it gonna cross the x-axis oh this is gonna miss it no it's sitting on it it's bouncing off of it that means you have one real solution one real because it does touch it solutions of imaginary and that's gonna that's gonna bear out in this this technique so let's let's set this equal to zero that's how we find x-intercepts from every single quadratic ever we set it equal to zero and then we acknowledge what technique is best well the guns to go right what's the first technique you try let's try to do square root method square method says if I can get everything on one side all my X's inside of a power to that and I can get a constant other side like that then I can take a square root so this is isolated all right this is fantastic and if I take a square root of both sides I've isolated a power to this is all my X's within a power to nothing multiplied nothing that is subtracted a constant over here and I'm taking square root of both sides and then we know that every time you're the one who takes a square root you put it close to minus on the left-hand side we get X minus seven on the right hand side we get something that I need you to see we get plus or minus zero and I know that's weird you go wait a minute not just zero yes see this is the zero is the only number that you can add and subtract from a number from another number and get the same answer it's the it's this this additive identity right so so you add it and it doesn't it doesn't change the yeah it doesn't change what you get so this is the zero is the only number in the world that we can add and subtract from a different number and get the same number in both cases so if we do this it's gonna look a little weird you probably wouldn't do this you probably just say okay this is zero great add seven you're done but I want you to notice what happens X would equal if I add seven where would I add it to I add it before the plus and minus just like here just like here I'd say okay this is 7 plus or minus zero now I'm gonna do this on purpose so that you see we're getting the same answer twice we still get two solutions we get the same solution if I took this and I said all right well this is a seven plus zero just like we did two negative two plus 1 and 7 minus zero just like we did make it 2-1 over here we get two solutions look at it we do have to write the plus and the minus zero gives us two solutions but we're getting the same solution twice seven plus a 0 is 7 7 minus 0 is 7 is because 0 is the only number you can add and subtract from a different number do the same thing out we get the same solution twice that is what happens what so when you get this this vertex on the x-axis that's what's gonna happen you're gonna get the same answer twice it's called a double root we'll talk about multiplicity much later but you're basically doing the same thing out at two different times this is the second this is the second a lot of times we get to different two different solutions and saying we get to distinct or different x-intercepts and we say okay we must be crossing there we have to be crossing once and then coming back if we get two solutions but they're the same solution what that's telling you just like I showed you with the shifting is that you have the same solution twice you're not crossing the x-axis your vertex is bouncing right off of it this we would say is one real solution technically yet you get two solutions but they're the same so it's really just one real solution there's no imaginary numbers here that's it now I'll make you a promise if you just get one solution from a quadratic it cannot be imaginary imaginary numbers always come in pairs you're gonna see that in just a little bit they always come in pairs so we can't ever get one imaginary solution they always come in conjugate pairs positive and negative of the imaginary part so we've had cases where they're all parabolas but we have two real x-intercepts we've had the one I showed that to you now because plus and minus square root of zero just gives you a plus and minus zero which gives you the same number twice and lastly let's look at what happens when we get some imaginary numbers so we have a spur a below it is a power too if I were to distribute that we would get this this quadratic but it's set up pretty nice for us so when we solve for X intercepts are four zeros and we set this equal to zero and the categorises and say you know what I'm able to isolate this power to so that all my X's are inside of a power tube and have a constant of this side I can subtract so it'd be fun to do that that's core movement that's gonna work nicely for us you know that doesn't look very nice because when we take a square root so we looked at it said set equals zero we said what's the best technique square root method because we can isolate the power tune with all their X's inside of it no X's anywhere else else outside of it I think added multiplied divided and a consonant on the right hand side and we take a square root the problem is you see it when we take a square root we have a square root with any negative number inside of it that's not possible well yeah it is it's not real it's not a real solution but but it is possible under imaginary solutions or complex numbers we still do like every time that plus or minus on the left hand side we're gonna get this 3x minus 2 on the right hand side we get let's think about it do we still have two solutions plus and minuses yes do we still have real solutions that negative says no and right now if you're if you're doing this and says tell me how many real solutions you get you go to zero you're done you're done if you start taking square roots of negative numbers you're getting imaginaries so you're saying I am NOT gonna have x-intercepts here realizes people that if you have no imaginary numbers yes you're crossing the x-axis twice if you have the same solution two different times two times they have no imaginary numbers you're bouncing right off the x-axis if you at any point get a negative inside of your square root you're gonna get a negative number and you are done as far as finding real solutions this does not have real solutions therefore if you're doing this you know this is not touching or crossing the x-axis at all this is going to be floating above how to know above well that's up early there's no negative in front of that so this is an upward-opening parabola that's completely missing the x axis now we have a clear picture that's what I want to teach you is to understand what you look what you are doing let's just do it anybody can do this but understanding it means that you've learned it so when we're learning this we're going this right here that's gonna give me an I know we're about that we're about to solve it but what we get is that that's a parabola it's upper opening and it's missing the x axis completely that's what this measuring stand tell us so when we simplify we know that we could write this as negative 1 times 25 times 3 and I'm pulling out that negative 1 because that negative 1 is what gives us the eye the square root of negative 1 is I the square root of 25 is 5 and the square root of 3 is let's leave that because it's an irrational number so we have plus or minus 5i square root of 3 and we see it right there that these are not real solutions this is saying okay where do we cross the x-axis you don't because that I says you can't plop that on a normal number line you know you don't cross it you don't touch it you completely miss it when we solve this for X do it the same way that I've been teaching here let's add two but put it in front of the plus or minus and then divide the whole thing by three so I'm gonna do that at one step X would equal if we add 2 we get 2 plus or minus 5i screw 3 if we divide by 3 we get that all over 3 now I would like to write this as two different solutions I want to say just a couple things about it number one do you still get two solutions yes and we talked about how with with I said this is a while ago when you have when you have a complex solution there will always be two of them there would never just be one of them why that is complex solutions come from taking a square root of a negative that's right here whenever you take a square root of a negative don't you always have to have a plus and minus in front of it yes so if you ever get a complex solution it's going to have a plus and a minus in front of it that means they always come in these pairs there will always be two of them if you don't have a complex solution you couldn't have taken a square root of a negative number and therefore you could take square root of zero it doesn't have lines in it but if you take a square root of a negative number and you get an eye it's always have a plus or minus in front of it which always gives you two of them at a time and we're going to find out a little bit later that complex numbers always come in water all complex conjugates I said that word a couple times I didn't find it what a complex conjugant is is same number same number same complex parts and sorry an imaginary person any minute or it's just a different sign in between them that's what a complex conjugate looks like same stuff different sign why different sign because of the plus and minus because you take the plus and minus that's giving me this part when you add the two that's giving this part in those you're adding the two to both of them at the same time that's what's going on less less couple things remember one you abb's that we have to realize that this is two solutions they are complex solutions and therefore we will not be crossed an x axis those are not x-intercepts they're complex solutions complex zeros and lastly I've seen this written a couple different ways this technically is improper as far as writing complex solutions really we should have one plus five halves room 3i and one minus five-halves root three I so this whole a plus bi complex form we really should be maintaining that but I've seen a lot of people not do that for for complex issues like this so he kind of depends on who you learn this from for me this is fine if you need someone if your instructor makes you and thanks you to you this as I've done in the past you take 2 over 2 that's 1 you take 5 root 3 over 2 and you put an eye at the end you put the I at the end of that that's that's technically in complex form so that would be the real part plus in imaginary part I hope that makes sense I hope that I've explained to you what how the the screwed method works why it does what it does and what's your what you're getting from it you should be seeing the parabola you should be in your head visualizing upward-opening visualizing crossing twice balancing once and missed it completely based on the type of solution that we're getting so hopefully explain that very well next time we'll talk about this what will transition to factory you
