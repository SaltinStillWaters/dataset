Transcript for: How to Prove Trigonometric Identities (Precalculus - Trigonometry 24)
welcome to another video so in this video we're going to tackle how to prove trigonometric identities they can be challenging so i'm going to give you some steps that is a general way to think about it does it work every single time exactly how i'm going to write this out like this no no it doesn't but most of the time this will give you a good first step on how to how to solve or how to prove some of these trig identities so i'm going to walk you through that we're going to do 11 examples right now a lot it's going gonna be a long video i know it um but it's important and so i'm gonna model my thinking that's mostly what i'm gonna be doing here is is trying to teach you how to think about them the identities themselves i've written the ones that we use most often on the board besides like the even and the odd and the reciprocal ones that are probably getting in your head right now so i've written the pythagorean identities i'm going to go through the steps if you watch the last video which i hope that you did on how to simplify some of the trig trigonometric functions um this is right along the same lines so here's the thought process and i'm going to model my thinking on 11 examples the first thing that we really want to look at in our trig identities is what looks like the harder side now does is always the harder side um no but it's typically the stuff the thing with more stuff on it we work on that side and we work on that side only if we can so try to work on just one side so we're going to take a look at the harder side whatever says ah tackle that first then what we do is here's some ideas then what we do is try to write it as one fraction if you have more than one fraction simplify it as you go if you can if you can't find an identity that's apparent so like it's just popping right at you if you can't do that then write everything as signs and cosigns that's a key thing if you have some identities right there then don't do this if you have an identity just kind of that's already there don't do that it'll often times simplify for you then use only identities that you actually know so the ones that we've written here don't try to make them up as you go or things you can manipulate so i've done that so we're going to we're going to do this in just a little bit but notice that this is all the same identity i've kind of known it's a service so we don't have to go on every example and kind of redo this but the pythagorean identities are on the top and then the the manipulations of them like subtracting cosine squared theta or sine squared theta or subtracting one or subtracting tangent squared theta we get two identities basically for free so these are all stemming from these top three identities so let's go right into it i'm gonna model my thinking i'll tell you exactly what i'm doing uh we'll talk about why i'm doing this like i always do and i'll refer back to these steps so let's take a look at this identities are one thing equals another thing in trigonometry that's what an identity is we're just trying to prove it when you prove it basically start with one side and show that eventually it equals the other side now it'd be great if we just looked at it when yeah that'd be nice but we can't it'd be great if we could just plug in a couple values for theta and show that it works but we can't we have to prove this for every valid theta on the domain of these trig functions so we have to show it for all of them that would take us forever and so we start with the let's say hard side and make it equal to the easy side if you will so we're going to take a look at this what side looks harder to me that looks farther than that that's just one term this is a product so i'm going to start with secant theta times sine theta and i'm going to start thinking in terms of this so this is my hard side i'm working only on this side does it have fractions i don't see any fractions uh okay so is there an identity that's right there for me no i really don't see an identity right there so i checked hard side no fractions no identities right there i'm going to write everything in terms of sine and cosine not that remember work only on one side so secant theta i can write that as 1 over cosine now i'm not going to write equals tangent i'm going to work this down until it actually equals tangent and then we'll have shown that one side equals the other and proven our identity for everything that's on the domain now let's go back all right uh i'm still on the hard side we're going to stick with that side so that doesn't really change but let's make this a single fraction so i'm going to make this 1 times sine sine theta over cosine theta i've made this one fraction now i've already rewritten in terms of sine and cosine but the point here is that as soon as you do something look for an identity that you know so i'm looking here going wait a minute sine theta over cosine theta is tangent theta as soon as you get down to what you wanted to show show it and that satisfies the proof so we started on one side we used some identities we wrote everything in signs and cosines one fraction we used a known identity and that's satisfied what you're what you're trying to show show that this side eventually equal tangent theta which is exactly what we stated in the beginning that's how a proof works this is a very good section a very good video for you to get introduced to how to prove things you don't just go plug in a couple numbers you have to actually show with known mathematics that this equals that that actually works and this is one way to go through and do that again it doesn't work in this order every single time the exact same way but it's a good series of steps and that's why we're doing a lot of examples to build that let's let's start the next one so secant theta minus 1 secant theta plus 1 equals tangent squared theta i'm going to first look at this and identify what i think is a harder side looks like the left hand side is harder there's more stuff over there next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to look if we have more than one fraction i don't have any fractions so that's satisfied i don't have anything going on there then i'm going to look for any identities that i have so i i don't see an identity here or here i do see a tangent squared though so i'm thinking uh i'm i'm tangent squared and then secant i have an identity here with that so i might not want to change that into sines and cosines just yet maybe i want to distribute this so i have these this couple couple factors being multiplied let's distribute this and see where it goes because this is very close to an identity right here so i'm going to choose to distribute so secant theta times c to theta secant squared theta we get plus secant theta and minus secant theta that's going to cancel and then we get 1 times negative 1 is minus 1. so i've started hard side i've looked at there's no fractions i didn't see an identity but i saw that we were kind of close to one so i chose to distribute rather than write things in terms of sines and cosines now what if you did write in terms of sines and cosines would you get the same thing well you would get 1 over cosine squared theta now if you saw that you go oh yeah 1 over cosine squared that is secant squared theta and now we're down to here so we're going to evaluate that there's no fractions um the next thing we should do is look to see if there's an identity right here so look hey look there's one right there secant squared theta minus one secant squared theta minus one is tangent squared theta and that's exactly what we were trying to prove it's kind of identities are kind of nice because it shows you what you want to get to so you know your goal it's kind of like uh looking at the textbook in the back and going oh that's what i'm trying to get to and then you figure out how to get there i know i'll do that um so that's that's what this is really about start on hardside figure out that it makes it equal to the other side um using the these ideas that i'm giving you so tangent squared theta does in fact equal tangent squared theta and that satisfies our proof man that connection these are getting a little bit more complicated cosine theta times tangent theta plus cotangent theta equals cosecant of theta and there's no argument that's the hard side so let's start there we're going to only work on that side let's see how this this works out for us we start by seeing if there's more than one fraction trying to combine them now i don't have more than one fraction i'm going to look for any identities or things that are close to identities this was very close to an identity i saw it because i was trying to get tangent squared that's what led me down this thought process of distribute rather than go to sines and cosines here i'm not real man i'm not seeing any identities they're coming up here i don't see any squares i'm not seeing anything that looks similar to this stuff over here so i'm probably going to write this in sines and cosines there's no fractions there's no squares there's no other identities let's go sines and cosines on this so that cosine looks good but this should be sine theta over cosine theta this should be cosine theta over sine theta and i'm only working on one side so i've i've done that now we have a choice here could you get one denominator and and make that one fraction you could but i do notice that i can simplify this so that's why i said these don't have to go in a hard and fast order we're always looking to see if we can simplify things as we go we're always looking at do i have an identity that's closed do i have a simplification that's close instead of making this one fraction right now i'm going to choose to multiply and simplify as we go so i'm going to distribute this so cosine theta times sine theta over cosine theta that cosine is going to cancel we're going to get sine theta but here i'm going to get cosine squared theta over sine theta what if you would have got one fraction here multiplied by sine over sine cosine over cosine and then distributed would be the same thing yes you absolutely would it's not it's actually not that big of a difference you'd get a common denominator of sine theta cosine theta your cosine would still cancel and you'd get exactly what we're going to end up with here in just a minute you see at this point i have two fractions this is over one this is cosine squared theta over sine of theta i need to make this one fraction so i've looked at and said that's the hard side i didn't see an identity i didn't see a simplification so i distributed it sorry so i changed it into sines and cosines i didn't see a clear identity here so i distributed i saw a cancellation there that's why we did that now i have two fractions i'm going to try to make that one fraction because i don't really see a great identity that's leading me on to to that well sorry that what we're trying to get to so i'm gonna make this into one fraction because this is over one my common denominator is sine theta i'm going to multiply that on the hand side over here so when we do it we get this sine squared theta over sine theta plus cosine squared theta over sine theta oh look we got a common number we can now make one fraction and you're gonna see exactly why we do that why this is here get a single fraction is because a lot of times when we do that things cancel and also we get some identities just pop right out of this so we're going to get sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta over sine theta another thing that i hope that you're seeing at me model is this idea of i'm always checking is there something i can simplify is there an identity that's popping out of me what that means is it's very apparent that's readily available that's on the board right now so i i did that from here i looked is there identity no not really um is there are we close to an identity yes for here i'm going to distribute that it's very close here not so much change signs and cosigns um i see a simplification so i notice that i'm going to distribute and simplify could you have made one fraction yes it would work out just as well after that i'm looking for an identity i don't really see one very well so i'm going to make one fraction okay we've made one fraction uh let's let's look for identity i see one right here sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta is one so instead of doing anything else like it's like simplifying this some other way we're going to use identities right when they come up so sine squared theta plus plus cosine squared beta is 1 that's going to give us 1 over sine theta now remember we're trying to get here so let's think about 1 over sine theta 1 over sine theta is cosecant theta so we did all this work and got down to cosecant theta cosecant theta does equal cosecant theta we've now proven this identity i hope that's making sense i hope that you're seeing the thought process we have a lot more to do but right now the the ideas should be sort of building your head on how to at least approach these identities let's keep right on going so we've got the sine theta cosecant theta minus cosine squared theta equals sine squared theta start with the harder side this is obviously the harder side that's just one term over there so we're going to take a look at this under the lines of do we have more have more than one fractions do we have identities are popping right out of us or do we need to write everything in sines and cosines so i don't have any fractions at all i'm looking at this that looks really close to an identity so it looks it has something to do with this this over here probably um but this doesn't and so i'm going to try to write everything in terms of sines and cosines and see what happens so sine theta cosecant but cosecant theta is one over sine theta so we're using that reciprocal identity so i'm working on just one side now let's make one fraction or just realize that sine theta times one over sine theta that's gonna cancel you're going to get 1. so i've simplified an obvious simplification there and now i'm going to re-evaluate this has no fractions everything's in terms of sines and cosines do i have an obvious identity well one minus cosine squared theta that's one of the the ways that we can represent the pythagorean identity right here so one minus cosine squared theta that is sine squared theta and we've got we've got down to exactly what we wanted to prove so we've shown that this side is sine squared theta since we're theta equals sine squared theta on this domain and we're done that's exactly proven identities let's do the next one so the next one is man this is a really good example for why we don't always just write things in terms of sines and cosines right off the bat so we look at it and go one minus cosine squared theta times one plus cotan cotangent squared theta equals one remember the ideas the ideas are if you have one fraction yeah you're probably going to be if you have more one fraction yeah you're probably gonna make this in terms of one fraction but we're always looking for can i simplify it what's gonna let me simplify it easily and do i have any identities that are right there already because if i do i don't want to be writing things in terms of sines and cosines if they're already in an identity that i can use so when we take a look at 1 minus cosine squared theta we just did that 1 minus cosine sine squared theta is an obvious identity it's well maybe it's not obviously you used to it's maybe a bad thing to say sorry um but it's an identity that that is known so 1 minus cosine squared theta is sine squared theta that's great why change that if it's already an identity we want to use let's make that into sine squared theta 1 plus cotangent squared theta again we're not going to be writing things in terms of sines and cosines if we have an identity already there one plus cotangent squared theta or cotangent squared theta plus one is cosecant squared theta so we started with the hard side we we looked for the one fraction thing we didn't have any fractions we thought about maybe doing sines and cosines but we want to check for simplification and for identities that are already known in there before we do that and there's two identities here and here that we're just right on the board for us that's great now we re-evaluate can i simplify that not that it looks like is there a known identity that works with this not that i can tell now is when we write everything in terms of sines and cosines so sine squared theta times cosecant theta is one over sine theta so cosecant squared theta is one over sine squared theta and now we reevaluate we have more than one fraction could you write this as one fraction yeah you would get sine squared theta over sine squared theta that's going to simplify and give you one one does equal one we worked on one side got it down to exactly what it said that it should equal that's proven that identity for us okay so secant to the fourth theta minus secant squared theta equals tangent to the fourth theta plus tangent squared theta don't you wish you could just go sure nailed it i believe you they're all worked anyway so why do i need to prove it first because it's good for you and doesn't feel good for you sometimes um but but secondly because it's important to understand how these proofs work important to be able to work with them and to give ourselves more identities so understand that every time we prove something you could now use that so if you ever see this again anywhere in your math you know that that is true so you'd say oh yeah okay you're not even getting that you know that that's going to equal one if you have this list of identities and you can do that you can develop your own identities like we're doing right here so let's start with the hard side what's the hard side they look probably equally difficult um secants look a little more difficult than tangents to me so i'm going to start there so i'm going to work on my left hand side i'm looking at that thinking is there an identity that's that's right up there there's one that's close i like that secant squared theta i don't like the secant to the fourth theta so instead of writing everything in terms of sines and cosines because i'm thinking this is probably close to some identity i'm going to factor i don't like the fourth power anyway i'm going to factor out a secant squared theta that would be a little more simple so let's simplify that by factoring so factoring out secant squared theta we get secant squared theta times secant squared theta minus one you can see by distribution that's true it's just basically like having x to the fourth minus x squared you factor in a gcf now let's reevaluate do we see an identity that's right up there something we can simplify secant squared theta minus 1 is right there that is equal to tangent squared theta so let's use that right when we see it don't do sines and cosines if you have an identity that's right there for you now we have the secant squared theta times tangent squared theta and this is one of those times that you want to keep in mind what you're going towards you're trying to get to tangent to the fourth theta times tangent squared theta this is one of the times we're writing things in terms of like sines and cosines probably wouldn't be that beneficial because i already have a piece of that i have a tangent squared theta what's the thing that i don't have in terms of tangent that one so maybe we use this and write this in terms of tangent so let's use the identity to change this thing so [Music] let's see secant squared theta is tangent squared theta plus one so i've kept on one side i've seen that something was close to an identity so i factored i used the identity i thought i got that and now i'm checking this is pretty close to this i don't want to do sines and cosines because i i already have a piece of that this is not close to that let's change that one with a known identity so we've done that now we're oh man we're so close but keep in mind we're trying to get to we're almost there let's distribute this and that satisfies the identity that we just proved so um is it always exactly like this every time no it's a good set of steps but we're also we're going to be critical thinkers you're going to be thinking about it the ideas are this works most of the time the ideas are well simplify if you can if you have a known identity that's going to help you use it right when you see it also keep in mind what our goal is your goal is to try to get this thing over here so sometimes writing things in terms of sines and cosines not such a great idea if you're completely stuck then yes that's a good way to go so i hope it's making sense i hope that i'm making it very clear for you we're going to step it up and do five whatever consider really difficult uh proofs let's go on to this example uh we're gonna we're gonna prove this identity and it's gonna use something that looks like a trick and frankly it is kind of a trick but it's thinking really smartly about what we want and what we have so uh 3 sine squared theta plus 4 cosine squared theta equals 3 plus cosine squared theta i want you to look at this side what i would consider the harder side and take a look how this looks a whole lot like this one looks very very similar but there's a 3 here and a 4 there if this was a 3 couldn't you factor the three out from both terms yeah and then that would be one but that's not a three that's a four well can i write it a little bit differently instead of having four cosine squared theta we can do things that are meant it's a really kind of a smart move here but we can do things that let us write this as like three cosine theta is cosine squared theta plus one cosine squared theta so check this out if this is really close to an identity that we want try to make it fit it's already in terms of sines and cosines that wouldn't help us i don't see an identity that's just right out there and i can't factor the way it is write it as something we can factor this is still 3 sine squared theta plus 3 cosine squared theta cosine squared theta that's still 4 cosine squared theta but it's made it so that this piece you can factor if you look at just that piece and factor out the 3 well then now that's a good identity so sine squared theta plus cosine squared that's one of our pythagorean identities that's one so this is three times one and that's exactly what we're trying to prove so i hope that makes sense that that's i mean it looks like a trick it kind of is a trick but it's also understanding that if you're very close to an identity this is what we saw in a previous couple few previous examples is make that identity work somehow don't change the identity that it's it's there it's right there just just make it work structure it so that you can factor structure this so that identity can pop out at you that looks a little crazy so sine squared of negative theta minus cosine squared of negative theta over sine negative theta minus cosine negative equals cosine theta minus sine theta when you see those negative angles those negative whatever the the argument of your your trig function are and that's negative use an identity use the even and odd identities remember the signs of odd function and cosines of even function it means they're changeable you can change that and so we're going to do it we're going to structure a little bit differently this is obviously the hard side it's always one fraction but we're going to structure a little bit differently so we recognize what's going on so sine squared means sine of whatever that angle is all to the second power this really means this this is sine of negative theta quantity squared same thing as that means sine squared negative theta means this thing right here all over let's start using the even and odd identities so sine of negative theta is the same thing as negative sine theta opposite inputs opposite outputs for odd functions no we're not just pulling the negative out front that that doesn't happen with trig functions you need identities you can't just make it up as you go we'd love to but we can't um sign's odd it's an odd function so that means that if i plug in a negative and a positive with the same absolute value angle you're going to get opposite results and that's exactly what we're showing here cosine's even so cosine says opposite angles equal outputs which means cosine of negative theta is same thing as cosine positive theta and we're going to use that here too so sine of negative theta is equal to negative sine theta that's an odd function cosine of negative theta is equal to cosine positive theta even function i also might factor out my negative i don't like that negative there so let's let's do that so i've taken and said that's an odd function okay that's going to be a negative that's an even function it's going to be a positive i have the power 2's i have the minus i factor this out because we really don't like seeing both those those biases down there and now we're going to go ahead and evaluate this negative sine theta squared what would happen with that well that would be let's see negative 1 squared that's what that is negative 1 squared would be positive 1 sine squared would be sine squared theta minus cosine squared theta all over negative side theta plus cosine theta man that's really close to identity but it's not one it's not an identity maybe what we can do is run this negative through there see what happens so i have everything on one fraction i have sines and cosines but i'm not seeing a clear identity i also don't like that negative so i'm going to make this negative sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta now it looks like we're kind of in the same position i don't see an identity popping out of me i've taken care of that negative it looks about as simplified as i can make it i don't see an identity that's like do this right now so maybe we try something else try something like can you factor it well if everything's in terms of sines and cosines and i have this all in one fraction and i don't see an identity you need some other algebra try to factor it i can't factor the denominator but the numerator that's a difference of squares that can be written if you had like x squared minus y squared you'd write x minus y x plus y well we have the same sort of situation let's write cosine theta minus sin theta cosine theta plus sine theta being a difference of squares it's nice that'll work for us we also might have noticed a little bit that that's what our denominator suggests so sometimes we can sort of cheat a little bit and look at what we're trying to get well we have currently and what would it take to simplify that so if i'm trying to get this and i have that thing and i have this i don't know what to do with try to factor it maybe it's going to cancel to give you exactly what you want and that's exactly what happens so when we factor this as a difference of squares we simplify the denominator that we have that's why we chose to factor that negative so that would be more apparent what happened so we're putting this in correct form so it's easier later so from the from the top use your even and odds make it simpler simplify as much as you can get down to something that's nice to work with negatives and denominators are not really good things moving structure this so that it's it's easier to look at positives first minus others and then try to evaluate everything signs and cosines one fraction but i'm looking at what i need what i have and letting that determine because there's no identities right out here for us then man i can factor that by any difference of squares simplify what i don't want and this gives me exactly what i did so this is cosine theta minus sine theta and we proved that the left side actually equals the right side that proves our identity let's go ahead and tackle another one so one minus cotangent squared theta over one plus cotangent squared theta plus two cosecant cosine squared theta equals one that's a lot that's obviously the harder side let's start with that now before we get going look for any identities that are apparent but don't get tripped up don't try to make them up on your own this is a great one so one plus or one sorry uh cotangent squared theta plus 1 or 1 plus cotangent squared theta that does equal cosecant squared theta but this is nowhere on our list in fact that's going to cause us a lot of problems on this particular problem because that's not an identity even though it really looks close it's not one it's not one of those things so what we're going to do is we're going to use the identities that are right there on the board for us right now we're going to change that into cosecant squared theta now we're working just on the left hand side so we're taking a look at it going now i don't see any other identities i don't see anything that's very nice to simplify nothing that's at least popping out to me so maybe now is the time where i make one fraction out of this that's one of the ideas here is to get everything on one fraction see what happens so let's do that because i'd have to multiply by cosecant squared theta we're going to get 2 cosine squared theta times cosecant squared theta all over cosecant squared theta let's put that on one fraction that's what we did that for is to get a common denominator so that we could combine this well that doesn't look very appealing at all in fact i don't even see an identity yet this is still isn't one this isn't one uh but what i do see is this this one's somewhat close you saw that from the beginning it's pretty close this is not in fact this has a cosine and something over sine so so this right here maybe work on this piece just this piece and try to get this written in terms of size and cosines if cosecant of theta is 1 over sine theta then cosecant squared theta is 1 over sine squared theta and we're going to make that little piece one fraction wait a minute cosine theta over sine theta is cotangent theta so that would be cotangent squared theta so this whole thing becomes two cotangent squared theta that's something we can simplify so don't change the signs and cosines now not when you have a combining like terms idea let's go ahead and do that so we saw this is an identity this is really close so we're going to use identity we saw two fractions making one fraction okay simplify whatever we can well you notice that this is pretty close to an identity i'm going to leave that one that looks really close over here this looks like garbage fix this one first so sines and cosines let us do that that's co cotangent squared so i did two cotangent squared theta now let's combine some like terms this is negative cotangent squared theta plus two cotangent squared that's plus one cotangent squared theta so this would be one combined like terms plus cotangent squared theta oh this is great news because now instead of making everything sines and cosines our first step before we do that is use identities that are already there so one plus cotangent squared theta that is exactly what we want to see that's cosecant squared theta and cosecant squared theta over cosecant squared theta is one so we worked on the left-hand side all the way down to here we got one that's exactly what we're trying to show one does equal one and so this satisfies and proves our identity i really hope this is making sense for you i hope that you've seen the the logic um the our ability to change uh with with these problems um that it's not just a hard and fast this is what you do every single time we really have to think about it they're multi-faceted there's a lot of things going on here and that's what makes them very challenging i hope i've given you a good outline that you're able to use for this we only have like two more examples that are in my opinion probably the most difficult glass or the most difficult one that we can go through it's going to be a lot to it but i hope you're seeing this structure i'm really trying to explain my thinking so that you can you can pattern yours on that all right let's get right to it so we've got a nasty problem it's an identity and it is going to be true so we're going to show that this equals 4 tangent theta secant theta keep that in mind we're trying to get tangents and secants out of this we are given everything in terms of sine we're also given things on two fractions so when we take a look at it i'm going to work on the harder side i'm going to look at this thinking i don't see any identities that are just popping right out of me but i do have two fractions let's start with that everything's already signs and cosigns let's make this into one fraction one fraction means you need a common denominator so i'm going to multiply this by one plus sine theta and this by one minus sine theta it's going to give us one plus sine theta quantity squared minus one minus sine theta quantity squared so let's do that 1 plus sine theta times one plus sine theta is one plus sine theta squared likewise over here but on the denominator on the denominator we get one plus sine theta times one minus sine theta and we're going to go ahead and distribute that so 1 minus sine theta plus sine theta that's cancelled and then minus sine squared theta so we're going to end up with 1 minus sine squared theta now that's a really good thing because this is an identity that says that we're going to have cosine squared theta on our denominator the problem is our numerator that looks really crazy man what to do well we can't just cancel these things out but maybe if we distribute this some of the things will actually simplify so let's go ahead and do it we have 1 minus 2 sine theta sorry 1 plus 2 sine theta and then plus sine squared theta over here we'll get one minus two sine theta plus sine squared theta so we're distributing this as one plus sine theta times one plus sine theta you do it off to the side if you want to but ultimately what we get is one plus 2 sine theta plus sine squared that is that's this so this came from our first first distribution minus oh my gosh it's really important to make sure that you have parentheses around what you're going to distribute here because you have that mind is going to change all of your signs so this would be 1 minus sine theta times another 1 minus on theta that's going to be 1 minus 2 sine theta and then plus sine squared theta you're going to see right now why it's so important to have this parenthesis hopefully you're with me hopefully you understand the distribution here distribution here i did see an identity we're going to use that right now that is going to be cosine squared theta but i didn't see an identity here here i had to distribute that there's nothing else we could do they're already signs and cosines now that we have distributed that our signs are all good we have parentheses here let's go ahead and run this through and change all of our signs i'm also going to make this cosine squared theta so i'm using identities that i know that are already popping up denominator looks really good it's as simple as we can make it it's the numerator that's sort of messing with this so let's go ahead and write this out none of the signs here are going to change all of the signs here yeah can we combine anything can we simplify we're always thinking that we're thinking do i have any identities that are right there can i simplify what's going to take to simplify for us what it took was we need a one fraction common denominator then we simplify what we get there okay then we have an identity that's known use it uh we can't simplify any of this stuff distribute that combine some like terms now simplify to to to make our numerator look a little bit better so we're going to say 1 minus 1 or gone we have a 2 sine theta and a 2 sine theta that's 4 sine theta my sine squared and my other sine squared once plus one's minus those are gone we're going to get 4 sine theta not sine squared we're not multiplying we're adding 4 sine theta over cosine squared theta this is as simple as you can make it so there's there's no other simplifying besides what we've done but it's not what we want this is why i said that you got to really focus on where you're trying to get to sometimes on this we're trying to get to a tangent and a secant now how the world's going to do that well if we have everything in terms of sines and cosines let's try to make this a tangent and a secant we have sine over cosine squared maybe if we split that cosine squared and think about it as sine over cosine times cosine or more specifically sine times one over cosine times cosine because this is tangent and this is secant the only reason i knew how why to do that was because of what we're trying to get so i knew we were trying to get a tangent let's make that at sine of cosine we also need to secant that's one over cosine and now that we can structure that this proves our identity and that's exactly what we wanted so hopefully hopefully that's making sense um sometimes we have to have an eye on what we're trying to get to in order to structure what we're going to do next a lot of this was make one fraction simplify use identities to show up simplify some more and then when you get stuck if you're already in terms of sines and cosines if you're not moving the signs moving to sines and cosines if you're already there look at what you need to get to and sometimes that'll help you so we have one more and then we're done all right this is going to take a lot of work and i'm going to go pretty quickly through it i'm going to show you a i hate using the word trick a manipulation uh to make this nicer and why i'm using it where in the world i would see it there's gonna be a lot of combined like terms a lot of little identities that we see in here um let's get right to it so let's start on the harder side i'm just going to model my thinking kind of show you it's kind of a fun problem and then it's very challenging like a puzzle but it can be extremely difficult if you don't see a couple things about this number one when you have stuff that looks really similar that's off by a sign like this one is try try this try factoring so that you make a couple pieces look the same why because what we're going to do here is multiply in such a way to create a difference of squares look on the denominator so that stuff cancels out so right now this looks very very close you go well what would i what i want i would want this idea of two terms why two terms so that we can do a difference of squares over multiplication so this three terms is nonsense i mean you can't do much with this but if i structure this as secant theta minus 1 and secant theta minus 1 and treat that like one term then i have stuff that's very similar in fact if i were to take one of these and multiply it by the other i would get this difference of squares look so what we're going to choose to do is take the numerator and multiply something over itself so that i get a difference of squares in the denominator the denominators are typically harder to work with so i'm going to multiply by that so we're going to take this thing and multiply here and here notice you can multiply whatever you want as long as you multiply it to the numerator and the denominator so we're going to do it just a little side note it doesn't have to be the numerator that you multiply now it can be don't do that it can be whatever you want so if even if the numerator wasn't there you could say i want to multiply by this thing except with that a plus it looks a lot like a conjugate do you remember that you could multiply by a conjugate of things that's practically what we're doing here so that we create a difference of squares idea now the numerator is just this quantity squared i'm going to choose to distribute right now but it's just factor it's just multiplying through what we really did was look at your denominator try to create this idea of a difference of squares multiplication that you have you can multiply whatever you want but it took the idea of having two terms to do that so we said three terms no no let's structure it so that we have two terms your denominator stinks let's multiply to get rid of rid of this idea of um something that you can't factor we want some squares in there that are factorable something nicer so we're going to do that numerator just sort of plays along here just so happens that it's going to be squared because it is that idea of a conjugate if you look at this in terms of two terms so let's go ahead and multiply through we're going to get tangent squared plus let's see tangent times secant theta minus one tangent times secant theta minus one so it's two and then plus secant theta minus 1 squared on the denominator we chose to do this idea of a conjugate one term two terms one term two terms with a different side of the middle is a conjugate idea so that we get our middle terms canceling that gives us tangent squared theta minus secant theta minus 1 squared we're gonna have a whole lot of distributing to do here so we've taken and just distributed this here and distributed this here but noticing that i'm subtracting that my signs are going to change i'm also taking a look at this looking for any identities anything i can combine i see tangent squared theta plus one tangent squared theta plus one is secant squared theta so i'm going to take this and that and i'm going to call it secant squared theta here i'm going to change signs so i've combined this is secant squared theta i've got it i have the same thing here same thing here same thing here i've gone ahead and changed my signs by subtracting term by term now i'm going to combine some like terms i see a secant squared and a secant squared that's two secant squared theta so i'm also noticing this is really really really close to this it's super close but it's backwards so if i thought about this tangent squared theta minus secant squared theta divided tangent squared theta minus secant squared theta i'd get negative one so we can use that combine like terms i get two secant theta minus 2 i'm going to restructure this so i can factor and so we're going to factor this we're going to factor a 2 here we're going to factor 2 secant theta from the numerator and we see that we could do one of two things we have one two huge terms both of which have secant theta minus one you could factor that out but this also has that so use some math here and simplify all of them so divide denominator and numerator all by secant theta minus one do the same thing again we had we can divide everything by two and that satisfies our identity and proves it i hope it makes sense we did a ton of factoring and a ton of simplification not a whole lot of identities i hope i've given you a set of steps that you can use to stretch your thinking for identities thanks for watching have a great day you
