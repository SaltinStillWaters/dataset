Transcript for: Finding Sides and Angles with Right Triangle Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 31)
hey welcome to another video so in this video i'm going to teach you how to solve for missing sides and missing angles in a right triangle we're going to use trigonometry a lot because sometimes pythagorean theorem and interior angle sum just simply won't solve for everything we need but it's an important point i have it written down when we're doing this when we're using trigonometry to solve a right triangle like the missing sides and angles one thing there's a few things that we really try to do every time number one try not to make it harder than it is use the easy stuff first so what what that means is that if we're going to be using trigonometry at some point there's no reason why we can't use pythagorean theorem and interior angle sum if it solves some of these parts for us there's a number of reasons why we do that as we get on through i'll be explaining that so what we're learning today is really just how to solve for missing sides and angles we'll be using trigonometry but don't forget this stuff is quite important and oftentimes a lot easier than using the trigonometry or maybe if it's not easier it at least gives us an exact answer rather than the approximations we normally get with tree so we're going to jump right into it i'm going to lead you through the process of how i pretty much always uh solve a right triangle how i label the sides how i identify what's going on we're only going to do four examples i'm going to work my way through exactly what i would expect you'd understand so let's take a look the first thing about working with right triangle trigonometry is making sure you actually have a right triangle because the sine cosine and tangent will not work the way that we've set it up with the sohcahtoa or sine is opposite over hypotenuse cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse tangent is opposite over adjacent it won't work without that being a right triangle so if we have a right triangle that's the number one thing we want to look for that this is going to work just fine the second thing i do on a right triangle is i always label the hypotenuse first before i do anything else i don't care whether it's pythagorean theorem or whether i'm using trigonometry i'm labeling the hypotenuse so i'm thinking if that's the 90 degree angle the hypotenuse is opposite of that so i'm thinking straight line right through my triangle it's going to hit my hypotenuse i label that after that i might start looking to see if i can find out anything else about this triangle before using trigonometry now i said i'm going to explain you why you might want to do that instead of just jumping right into the trig it's because when you use trigonometry you oftentimes will give an approximation we do not want to use those approximations in finding more measurements unless we absolutely have to why because when you take an approximation you're rounding a number if you use that rounded number in other functions you're going to round it again you're compounding error so you have a little bit of error because you round it then you use it again and then you round again well that's going to compound that there's really only one operation that we'll be using that does not compound error and it's subtraction so i'll talk about when we get to finding angles more about how subtraction does not compound our error in this case but just just keep this in mind pythagorean theorem will give you an exact answer every time in terms of a square root and interior angle sum will give you an exact answer every time in terms of in terms of degrees of an angle trigonometry sometimes doesn't do that so it's really in our benefit to figure out everything we can the easy stuff or use interior angle summit pythagorean theorem before you start to treat so when i'm looking at this i'm seeing yeah there's a four there's a b i can't really find my hypotenuse i'm not even asking for that anyway but pythagorean theorem really isn't going to be useful for us because i only know one side however interior angle sum is very useful for us if i know the angles of a triangle in triangle add up to 180 and i also know that this is a right triangle 90 of that 180 is taken up that's only 90 degrees left between the two angles that i have what that means we talked about this word while back last video actually is that these two angles are complementary that means adds up to 90. so if you know one of them you automatically know the other so it's always okay to take 90 degrees minus one angle and you get the other angle in a right triangle so i know for sure that a is going to be 80 degrees because a and 10 degrees have to add to 90. now did we need trigonometry to do that no and it's nice to have that that angle now we're going to go ahead and try to figure out what our missing side is so there's something that i often do i'll teach students this is kind of a process of elimination of finding out what trig function you need so i've identified a right triangle i've put my hypotenuse i figured out my angle by interior angle sum of a triangle and now i'm going to be looking at this triangle as what else can i label here's what i mean by that when you're dealing with a right triangle and about to use trigonometry it's super useful to label your hypotenuse but then what i want to do i want to look at what angle is given or what angle i want to use if both of them are given and then relate the sides to that angle so right triangle yes hypotenuse i've labeled it i'm going to mark down what i think is the angle that would be easiest to use i know both 10 degrees and 80 degrees i'm really more comfortable using this angle i don't know why it just seems easier to find the opposite side the hypotenuse i ever sorry opposite adjacent sides from that so i'm going to be thinking about this angle so after you've labeled the hypotenuse after you've identified the angle you want to find or want to use after that then we're going to label our sides i'm going to think straight through my triangle here is going to give me the opposite side to the angle i want to use i'm going to label it opposite the only side left is the adjacent side what this does for us it makes it really easy to choose a trig function because what we're going to do what trig functions always do they relate an angle to two sides well what trig function relates the angle that i've marked that i want to use with the two sides that i one know and other don't well that would be opposite over adjacent we can find a trig function that relates opposite and adjacent to an angle it's going to be tangent there is another way to look at this look at the one side that you don't know and you don't care about well that's the hypotenuse i'm not asked to find it and it's not given so i can't really use it so if you have eliminated the hypotenuse from your useful sides eliminate the hypotenuse on your trig functions and it will leave you with the one you have remaining it's kind of a process of elimination so sometimes i'll have students just write out sohcahtoa because that's sine cosine tangent what we actually use to solve for angles and sides and right triangles most of the time and i'll say what side don't you really care about i don't care about hypotenuse okay i'm not given it i'm not asked for it that uses hypotenuse that uses hypotenuse what's only one left tangent we have to use tangent here to find that side if we're going to be looking at that angle so we write it out now that we know that that's 80 degrees we don't have to use angle a we know it's 80. can you see how it's useful to know both angles if at all possible if you're given one you do know the other it's pretty useful to know because it it lets you have more options that also says something there's more than one way to do this so could you have identified this angle and then labeled this as opposite and this is adjacent to that angle yes absolutely as long as you use it in a trig function appropriately you really can't go wrong okay so i know i know it's right triangle i label hypotenuse i've identified an angle that i want to use opposite adjacent from there i've eliminated the possibility of sine and cosine i'm dealing with tangent tangent relates an angle to the opposite over adjacent sides in this case tangent of 80 degrees is 4 over b now how in the world would you solve for b this is really a two-step process you see if we if we have a fraction with variables on it we got to get rid of that denominator even if it's itself is a is a variable how we do that is multiplying both sides by our denominator so we're going to multiply both sides by e on the right hand side yeah these cancel and you get four but on the left hand side we get b times tangent of 80 degrees we're really close to done we we just have to divide and if we do that tangent of 80 degrees divided by tangent eighty degrees is one it leaves us with v and we get b equals 4 over tangent 80 degrees listen this is what is called an exact answer this has all the information about that side this is exactly how long that side is in terms of whatever units you had but it's not very useful you see we can't probably can't cut a piece of lumber at 4 divided by tangent of 80 degrees because we don't really know we don't practice using that in real life so oftentimes you'll see this approximated so in doing that you take your calculator plug it in just like it looks 4 divided by tangent of 80 degrees we get about 0.71 0.71 units if that had been inches we'd put inches feet feet and so on there there's something that i just said though this is about 0.71 here's what i don't want you to do this is something we really got to avoid if this is 0.71 and that's been approximated don't use approximations in future math if you can avoid it at all almost at all costs there's times when we have to but if you can avoid it do not use approximations to figure out other measurements so how in the world would you figure out c if i asked you to well what we could do is use trigonometry but just look at either a different angle or a different trigonometric relationship to do it if we wanted to continue if i wanted to find out what the hypotenuse was the last thing i'd want to do is pythagorean theorem right now why well because well that's 4 this isn't exactly 0.71 is it it's like 0.705 something something something forever if i use this i've already rounded then i'm going to put this in a square so i'm going to square 0.71 0.71 squared is going to make that error worse then i'm going to add it to 4 squared and take a square root of it when i take the square root it's going to make the error worse yet and then i'm going to round it again and it's really the second rounding that causes the compound of the error i will have rounded used it and rounded again it's going to be more off than i want it to be i don't want to have that much error in it so if you can avoid it don't use your rounded numbers so so let's think is there a different way we could go to find out c well let's see if i'm not really concerned about finding the adjacent and i can't use it does that eliminate some other trig functions i mean i already have the hypotenuse i already knew what that was already have this angle that i'm comfortable using so i'm going to mark that again this is still the opposite side this is the adjacent side this is the hypotenuse side for sure but if i can't use the adjacent side anymore because it's already been rounded if i can't use it that eliminates the possibility of cosine and tangent the only thing that's left open to us to solve for our hypotenuse is sine and that's really nice that's really the way we want to go through it is eliminate what you can't use and that will leave you with what you can some people just look at and go hey there's my angle i have opposite i need hypotenuse sine would relate the angle i know or want to use to the opposite hypotenuse that's fine too either way you want to go we run into a really similar situation so we're going to multiply both sides by c to remove the fraction and then divide both sides by sine 80 degrees to solve for c and we get that c is exactly 4 divided by sine 80 degrees but approximately 4.06 question is it making sense why this number is slightly bigger than this number i want you to think about sine remember that sign always returns values between negative one and one there's nothing bigger than one so if i'm going to divide four by a number smaller than one it should give me a larger number that's why division here gives you a larger number not a smaller number also let's make sure this makes sense remember that the hypotenuse has to be the longest side 4.06 4 and 0.71 okay good hey that's a great way to check our work also smaller angles generally open to smaller sides 10 degrees opens to opposite 0.71 80 degrees opens to 4 that makes sense our larger angles are opening to larger sides and our smaller angles are open to smaller sides the last thing is that i'm just going to reiterate one more time if you had done pythagorean theorem of 0.71 and 4 you'd be close to this number but this would be more accurate because you didn't have to round a rounded number i hope it makes sense i hope you're seeing the the process of going through it labeling your hypotenuse finding your angle labeling your sides and then kind of determining which trig function lets you do what you need to do don't use rounded numbers in other math unless you have to the only time we really do that is when we're subtracting angles i'm going to get to that in a couple examples for right now let's go ahead and do another one let's go ahead and give this one a try so we have a triangle it's a right triangle that means pythagorean theorem and trigonometry you're going to work for that's the first thing i check is if i'm if what i have is going to work with what i want to use so that's a right triangle it works with pythagorean theorem it works with trigonometry that's a good thing next i'm trying to identify what in the world i'm trying to find and ultimately going to be labeling my hypotenuse so i take a look and say that's a right triangle before i do anything else i'd label hypotenuse now that we've labeled the hypotenuse one of the first things i always do is see if some of the maybe it's not easier but the things that will give you the exact answers will work on this what i mean by that trigonometry oftentimes gives you approximations back you're using your calculator and you round it pythagorean theorem doesn't do that interior angle sum doesn't do that it gives you a square root for pythagorean theorem it can give you exact angles for interior angle sum and so that would be preferable than rounding something so i'm always looking does pythagorean theorem or anterior angle sum help me find what i need if i have to find two angles in the hypotenuse in this case i'm probably seeing that these guys work for for me first i see two sides they're their legs that's great i see a hypotenuse that i'm going to have to find pythagorean theorem works great this is preferable to using trigonometry also i don't have any angles so i kind of have to do something now now what's the other thought process couldn't you find an angle first and then use this angle to find the hypotenuse you can but remember when you find one of these angles it is going to be rounded for you to be able to use it later and so if you use a rounded angle here this is not going to be exact pythagorean theorem returns something exact for you that's pretty that's preferable that's nicer and so we're going to do that so use the things that aren't trigonometry to figure out some of these these measurements before you use trig if you can so i'm thinking all right if this is the hypotenuse this is a leg and this is leg this is why i label hypotenuse first every time so off to the side i'm going to write out my pythagorean theorem i always do it the same i always write out parentheses parentheses square everything and add these together then in my mind i really know what happens i know the hypotenuse is by itself it's always alone being squared that's just c in this case i know my legs are always together and that'll really help you to fill out pythagorean theorem always fill this out with hypotenuse on one side legs on the other side everything's being squared added together so leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared if we solve that this is 9 plus 25 that's 34 so c squared equals 34. if we take a square root you actually do not need a plus and minus because we're not dealing with like an x y coordinate system where we could have a negative radius or something these are actual measurements so this is just the square root of 34. now that is exactly what this hypotenuse is this is not an approximation i know for sure that's square root 34. what i don't want to do i don't want to round that to well let's see something just under six five point something i don't wanna round that and use that in later math remember do not use rounded numbers in future math if you can avoid it i'm gonna leave this as exactly square root of three four now could i do an approximation yeah sure and if you wanted to cut this to a measurement or something you might do that but to use it in math it should be exact so i looked at it uh man right triangle looks good label hypotenuse if i can do anything else besides trig i do it now so i can't find any angles i don't know one of them i can find the hypotenuse by pythagorean theorem we're looking pretty good now the benefit of understanding that that's an exact answer is that you can use this in trigonometry this is this is what it is it's not round it's not an approximation you can use that that's why we do things like pythagorean theorem and interior angular first it gives us exactness which you can then utilize trigonometry doesn't do that um if we round it it is rounded and you should not use it so now we gotta find some angles um how we do this depends on which angle you want to find first it doesn't really matter my personal preference i like finding angles at the bottom of the triangle because it works better in my head so i've already labeled hypotenuse but once i've identified an angle that i'm given or an angle i want to use or find which i have i want to find that angle then i go on and label the rest of my triangle and now i'm going to go ahead and look straight across that triangle this is the opposite side and this is now the adjacent side it has to be because all relatable hypotenuse that's why we do it first so now that we've done that i'm thinking through what trig function do i want to use or that i can use to relate the angle i want to find to two of the sides that i i know now i know all three sides so so look this gives you options you can do this a number of ways any way is right as long as you're using a correct trig function that relates two sides that you know one thing we don't remember i'm going to say this a lot one thing we don't want to do do not round that and then use that you cannot do that i guess you can but don't do that so normally what i would do is look for two sides that are kind of easier i probably don't want to use the square root of 34 even though it doesn't really matter so i'm looking at angle a and i'm thinking hey i know opposite over adjacent i know opposite over hypotenuse i know adjacent over hypotenuse i know sine cosine and tangent of all these but tangent uses what i would consider simpler numbers so i'm thinking with sohcahtoa if i know all three of them i can use any of those trig functions but if i don't want to use the hypotenuse then i probably don't want to use sine or cosine i'm going to use tangent and because tangent of angle a relates an angle to the opposite and adjacent side we get tangent of angle a equals 5 over 3. now how in the world you solve for an angle like that everything in math that you want to solve for requires a type of inverse for instance if you want to solve something with addition you need its inverse you need subtraction if you want to solve something with multiplication you need its inverse you need division if you want to solve something with tangent you need its inverse see multiplication and division just addition subtraction are not inverses for this this tangent says i'm a function that relates a this angle to two sides if you want to undo tangent you need the thing that undoes tangent and we call that tangent inverse the second part of it is whatever you do to an equation you're pretty much good to go as long as you do it to both sides so when we see tangent of angle a equals five thirds i need the thing that undoes tangent we call that tangent inverse so if we do this to both sides and say i'm going to take tangent inverse of both sides of this equation then here's what this here's just basically says in plain english thing that undoes tangent of tangent now what's going to happen tangent the thing that undoes tangent is going to undo tangent you're just going to be left with a much like multiplication cancels division much like addition cancel subtraction tangent inverse cancels tangent this is going to go away you wouldn't want to use like sine inverse for tangent match the appropriate function so i'm going to undo tangent with tangent inverse it's inverse it's undoing thing i just have to do it on both sides because that's how equations work so i'm left with just a on the right hand side we have tangent inverse of five thirds now that looks a little funny but this is exactly what that angle is this would be called an exact answer tangent inverse gives you out an angle if tangent of an angle gives you outsides tangent inverse of sides gives you out an angle specifically that angle the one that you mark the one you set up for this the angle that you are referencing so that's exact that's exactly what it is but it's not as usable is it because we can't we don't really know what that measurement is off top of our heads so we can take our calculator press tangent inverse it's usually right above the tangent you'll need a shift or a second button and press 5 thirds and we're going to find out the degree measurement for this if your calculator is in degrees which i'm going to use or the radian measurement for this if your calculator is in radians usually with right triangle trigonometry we're more about degrees so i'm going to keep this in degrees now we get the angle a is about 59.0 degrees a couple things about this is kind of important that a lot of people just skip if you're gonna round something even if you round it and says oh you're gonna have zero don't put just 59 that 59.0 tells people that you've rounded it says oh yes i've rounded to one more decimal place and the information i'm given that's usually how the rounding rule works but i've rounded this and this 59.0 would tell people that so it's not exactly 59 degrees and people would know that by how you're writing that secondly if this is about 59 degrees we now know this angle could you figure out this angle angle b and the answer is yes this is the one time that you can use approximated values to figure out something else here's why subtraction in this case does not compound your error if you were to do this another way how much you do it well you might do it tangent of angle b equals opposite three over five but what you're going to get is an approximation that when you subtract from 90 is exactly the same as this one so if you're only caring about the approximations you can easily subtract this from 90 this from 90 degrees and get that angle and we would get that b is about 31 degrees hey they're complimentary they add up to 90 degrees remember you don't really want to do that with any any of this other stuff pythagorean theorem or any other trig functions the only time it really doesn't hurt us all that much is with interior angle sum now let's say you needed the exact answer and 31 degrees wasn't good enough and they said you have to know exactly what it is it's like that well then you'd have to go through the trigonometry so you'd have to adjust the angle you're looking for what that means is that the side you've marked as adjacent is no longer adjacent if you change angles you change or you swap those sides so i really don't want to look at angle a if i'm trying to find angle b by itself now your hypotenuse won't change but opposite would now be three and adjacent would now be 5. so we could set up tangent again tangent of angle b equals opposite over adjacent if we take tan inverse the inverse or the thing that undoes tangent on both sides we're going to end up with tangent inverse of three fifths tangent inverse of three fifths is about 31.0 degrees this is the exact angle that that is for sure but when you approximate it to use it you would end up getting which is why it's okay to subtract them you would end up getting exactly what you get when you subtract 90 minus that approximation it does work every time that what you get here and what you get here if you round to the same digit is going to add to 90 degrees which means you can use it for approximations you can't use it for exactly so can you like this this does not tell you the exact answer if you subtract you'd have to do other trigonometry for that so i hope that that's made sense i hope you're seeing the process of going through it label the hypotenuse use the stuff before trigonometry that you can and then with trig we're identifying an angle that we have that we want to use or that we want to find after that labeling opposite and adjacent and using an appropriate trig function we're going to come back we're going to do one more and then we're going to give you a real life example okay last one before our application type problem we want to solve this right triangle what's solving a right triangle means just finding all the missing sides and angles so let's let's look at this it is a right triangle and let's label what we want to label first mostly on this example i'm just going to walk you through exactly how i would do this problem and model in my thinking so i'm looking at a right triangle thinking right triangles have a hypotenuse i label this first every single time the next thing that i do is i see if anything else can be used before my trigonometry to figure out some missing pieces the reason why i do that is because pythagorean theorem and interior angle sum give out exactness and not approximations trigonometry oftentimes will give us approximations i don't want to be using approximations to figure out other pieces of math so i'm looking at this as a right triangle yes hypotenuse yes but i'm noticing have two sides and i can find a third one so i'm going to use pythagorean theorem to find that side and not trigonometry i don't even have an angle anyway so i can't but i don't want to use trigonometry to find an approximation to an angle then use that approximated angle to find a missing side that would be a no-no that would take an error and compound it to more error error being slightly off from the exact that's what we mean by that so i'm looking this going pythagorean theorem is is a win for me i'm going to do leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse squared we'll go ahead and i always fill my hypotenuse out first so i have a pattern that works in my head i know hypotenuse is always by itself being squared so i locate it i've already labeled it now 6 goes there i'm just going to make sure my legs are on one side it doesn't matter the order it just matters that the legs are are together on one side equation hypotenuse on the other and you follow the pythagorean theorem then we're going to simplify i know b squared plus 16 would equal 36 b squared now would equal 20 if we subtract 16 if we take a square root b now equals let's see 20 is 4 times 5. the square root of 4 would be 2. the square root of 5 is not simplifiable in a square root so this side is exactly 2 square root 5. you could certainly find an approximation just take two times square root of five and you'll have about how long that is here's what you can do and here's what you can't do what you can do you can use this in more math why because it's exact this is not a rounded thing here this is exactly what you you you have for that length which you can't do you can't approximate this which means giving you a decimal that your calculator gave you you can't give me a decimal and then use that number because that's rounded that's not quite exactly what it is now do you really want to use that side well i'll tell you what these two sides are a little bit nicer to use so i'm probably not going to do that but you could if you wanted to so i've used pythagorean theorem i found out everything else that i could that's an additional sign but i still need to find two angles so how do i do it identify the angle that you want to find now that could be either a or b i'm going to find angle a because it looks a little bit nicer for me to label opposite and adjacent doesn't really matter the reason why we mark it is so that we don't accidentally get confused what angle we're working with so i mark angle a i've already labeled hypotenuse but after you've marked an angle you can now label the opposite side and the adjacent side so it goes in a very specific order hypotenuse find out the stuff you can without trig label an angle you have or one you want to find i've done that from that angle label the opposite side that's right across draw a straight line or imagine a straight line from that angle right through your triangle it will hit your opposite side the last side has to be adjacent what adjacent means is next to so the adjacent side would be the side that's next to your angle but not the hypotenuse you've already labeled hypotenuse so that's not even a big deal it's got to be this side now we're free to go we know all three sides you can you could use tangent as 4 over 2 square root 5. i wouldn't you could use sine as 4 over 6. you could use cosine as 2 square root 5 over 6 which one would be easiest i like the one that doesn't have the square root so when i look at this i see angle that i have i see an opposite side i see a hypotenuse side i probably don't want to use adjacent so if i don't want to use the adjacent maybe i rounded and i can't use it you shouldn't but maybe because as a square root i don't want to if i don't want to use adjacent i don't want to use tangent or cosine i just want to use sine so i'm going to relate sine of a that's the angle i've marked that the sides that i reference according to the angle sine of angle a equals four over six notice this technique of eliminating what you you really don't want to use or eliminating what you don't have can be very helpful a lot of students really like that it works especially if you only know two sides or sorry if you only know one side and an angle and you're trying to find a specific missing side that works very very well so now that i have sine of a equals 4 over 6 i've got to solve for a so i need to undo sine i know sine sine inverse undoes sine so i'm going to do sine inverse of both sides sine inverse is going to undo the sine and leave us with a sine inverse of 4 6 is an exact answer that that is that is an angle so if sine of angle gives you sides sine inverse or sides gives you back an angle this is the exact angle also you do not need to simplify that at least well i wouldn't because your calculator is going to do it for you you can it's not a problem for an exact answer if you need to leave it yeah you probably use sine inverse of two-thirds but when you're using this for an approximation purpose plug it in just like that so we get that angle a is about 41.8 degrees now how in the world you find angle b if you're only concerned about the approximation just subtract 90 minus the angle absolutely fine so 90 minus 41.8 is 48.2 if you needed the exact angle you'd have to do more trigonometry so we would re-identify what angle we're looking for like angle b we re label our sides like this is the opposite and this is the adjacent your hypotenuse does not change and i think about what i want to use in order to find angle b so i probably don't want to use a square root so i'd cross out let's see that would be the opposite side i wouldn't want to use tangent and i want to use sine because those include the opposite side i've used cosine cosine of angle b would be adjacent over hypotenuse 4 over 6. if we do all the work if we take it cosine inverse of both sides if we use that as an approximation then we're going to get exactly the same thing we got from subtraction if we round to the same decimal place so this is about 48.2 degrees but that is the exact that's exactly what that angle would be the last thing we want to do is is check make sure that this makes sense how's the pythagorean theorem held to that's the longest side yeah it really has that's less than six has it held to larger angles open to larger sides this opens to four uh this larger angle opens something slightly more than four this is a little over two so something a little over two times two is something a little over 4. so i hope that's made sense to you i hope that this uh this process is really starting to click it really does help to label the sides the way i've shown you in order to pick out the right trig function so i'm going to come back with one more and then we're going to be done okay last example let's suppose you wanted to find the height of something really tall but you couldn't actually measure it like maybe a volcano because you can't measure the top of a volcano that you won't want to climb to the top of a volcano so is there a way to do it well with some instrumentation you certainly can so let's imagine that you look on i don't know google maps or something and you found that a distance from the center of this volcano to a place that you can reasonably stand is like 80 feet and from that place you're able to take an angular measurement with like a clinometer or hypsometer or some sort of tool and you figure that from that point to the top of that that volcano is 85.4 degrees can we figure out the height well the height would create this this perpendicular this this right angle so we have a right triangle so what now what we're going to do the first thing you do on any right triangle is label the hypotenuse so if i see this right triangle i'm going to label the hypotenuse next let's see if we can find anything without trigonometry so pythagorean theorem man if i knew the hypotenuse i could find the height i wouldn't even need trig um i could find that angle it's not really relevant to this i'm not asked for it so i don't really need to find it i'm just focused on the height here so there's not really anything that's causing me to need anything but trig here so how do i know i need trig i'm given an angle and asks for a missing side that's usually an indication you're using trigonometry so i have seen right triangle i've done hypotenuse i've checked if i need anything else besides trigonometry and i don't let's go ahead and let's mark out the angle that i'm given or an angle that i want to use now i'm seeing that i've been given this angle of 85.4 degrees i'm going to be using this angle so i'm going to mark that from that angle let's label the opposite side and the adjacent side the hypotenuse is done so thinking straight through this triangle i would come across this as my opposite side the only other side left is the adjacent side so i right triangle got this got opposite got adjacent now we're going to find the trig function that actually works so let's see what we have let's see what we don't have and what we don't need to find opposite looks pretty important because i need to find it adjacent looks pretty important because i have it hypotenuse hypotenuse is not given nor is it even asked for so i don't need to use it and i certainly don't want to use anything that that needs it so if i don't need or don't want or don't have hypotenuse it has nothing to do with the problem that means that all the trig functions that involve the hypotenuse are off the table the only one left is tangent and thankfully tangent of this angle is going to relate the hype the opposite what i want to know with the adjacent what i already know remember that with three things an angle and two sides you need to know two of them to find the missing one so i need to know an angle and a side to find a missing side and that's exactly what we have so tangent of 85.4 degrees equals h that's the opposite over 80. we're going to solve for h when you have a fraction with a variable in an equation most of the time we get rid of that fraction by multiplying by the denominator so let's multiply both sides by 80. okay you know what we're done if you were looking for an exact height of this volcano or whatever it is this is it this contains all the information about how high this is from the base to the very top of that volcano now most of the time we want to do an approximation just to get a better handle on what that means so plug this into the calculator we get about 985.91 feet so that's a pretty good approximation for how tall that that volcano is provided that our information is accurate now what might be a better approach is this number actually reasonable to find well maybe if you have like a a map of it from from the top you could do that like a google earth thing look down and there's a center there's an edge where i'm standing that's fine a lot of times though we don't we don't have that so what could you do if you did not have this number number one tangent would not work because you need that adjacent you need to know something else what some people do is they take uh what's called a laser rangefinder and they say hey if this is a certain distance from here to here then i could use well what if this is a known number like from a range finder or something you could use here's your angle you'd still know that here's your height you'd still want to find that if you knew this number it would be opposite over hypotenuse you wouldn't be able to use adjacent you wouldn't be able to use cosine or tangent you'd have to use sine now it's still very possible you just multiply sine of 85.4 degrees times whatever that number is that you would find that's probably a little more realistic for like i want to do this right now type of thing rather than having us to look from like a bird's eye view or something so i hope this lesson has made sense i will be giving you a good technique on how you take trigonometry and apply it to right triangles to find missing sides like we've done here and missing angles like i showed you earlier i hope you're doing well we're going to move on to law of sines next time and deal with non-right triangles which is kind of fun too have a great day you
