Transcript for: Using Sum and Difference Formulas in Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 26)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk a bit more about how to use the sum and difference formulas for our common trig functions so i'm going to lead you through a few examples that are really common they get asked like all the time so i'm going to teach you how to go through those we'll talk about some much more difficult examples that involve some inverses and i'm going to prove something for you that now we can with these formulas that have been stating for a while that sine and cosine are phase shifts of one another we've seen it graphically we just haven't ever proved it so i'm going to go ahead and lead you through that so let's get started let's talk about a very common situation where you're given sine of some angle that you don't know and cosine of another angle that you don't know that equals something but then they ask you for a whole bunch of stuff like hey find sine of alpha plus beta when you have no idea what alpha and beta are or cosine alpha plus beta tangent of alpha minus beta or any kind of manipulation of that sine of alpha minus beta so i'm just going to lead you through three of them so here's how to get started on this problem if you don't know all of your trig functions for alpha or for beta the first thing that you have to do is find them you see when we're going through and asking for some of these things like sine of alpha plus beta well we're going to need to know sine of alpha and cosine of alpha sine of beta and cosine of theta tangent of alpha and tangent of beta and that's not given to you so the first thing we're going to do is take some time to actually solve for what cosine of alpha and tangent of alpha are given what we know about alpha itself also before we get going i want you to take a look at what i've done to the formulas i've condensed them this is fairly common but it leads to a lot of confusions because the students don't know and they shouldn't really be expected to what is going on with the signs so sometimes you'll see formulas condensed like this where this says sine of alpha plus and minus beta here's how to read this if you read the top sign sine of alpha plus beta then follow the top side here that would be sine alpha cosine beta plus cosine alpha sine beta follow the bottom signs to get the other formula so sine of alpha minus beta would be sine of alpha cosine beta minus cosine alpha sine beta same thing for like cosine alpha plus or minus beta cosine alpha plus beta you'd go cosine alpha cosine theta minus sine alpha sine beta so you can see that the sines are reversed because that's how the formulas actually work cosine alpha minus beta would be cosine alpha cosine beta but then plus so you're following the bottom sign and a bottom sign and that condenses your formula same thing for tangent plus would give you a plus and a minus minus would give you a minus and a plus so just watch out for that sometimes you see those and they're they're rarely explained very well what's actually going on so let's get back to our example the very first thing we want to do is find the other trig functions given what we know so sine alpha equals three-fifths and they're telling you something about alpha it's important to know this it's important to know the quadrant that your angle's in why well because we have a few situations that if we didn't know that we could get different trig functions we could get either a positive or a negative cosine a positive or negative tangent and we need to be able to figure that out so sine alpha is three-fifths and our alpha resides in zero to pi over two think about this part first so think about what quadrant that's in if alpha is from zero to pi over two we know that we're in quadrant number one we also know something about sine sine of alpha equals three fifths says that sine relates a y to an r this this idea of opposite over hypotenuse or a y-coordinate value to a radius well if we know that if we know that y is three and r is five and we're in quadrant number one then we can we can go ahead and draw something in fact we can draw the angle alpha so we know that our y value is three and our r value is 5 for this particular alpha that is in quadrant 1. so that's a really good representation of that angle we know yeah sine of alpha whatever that is in quadrant one because this will tell us gives us a height of three and r of five or y of three would be more specific and a radius of five there remember that three-fifths could be a y-coordinate on a unit circle itself but we can also think of this as y or we've talked about that pretty much at length now given that we've got to go ahead and find cosine of alpha and tangent of alpha to be able to find the rest of this stuff so how do we do that well the only thing that we really need is the x that's really convenient because by pythagorean theorem we know that x squared plus y squared equals r squared or leg squared plus like squared equals hypotenuse squared now i mentioned a little while ago like two minutes ago that it's really important to know the quadrant here's why when you work through the pythagorean theorem oftentimes you're taking a square root of the end so if we take a square root of both sides we're going to get x equals oh don't forget this plus or minus the square root of 16. you see that x coordinate if we hadn't have had quadrant number one you could have put a y value of three and an r of five in this quadrant as well but the x would have been negative here the reason why quadrant one's so important is so that you know which to pick that's why i'm always drawing pictures of these things so we know hey quadrant one means my y is positive my r is always going to be positive for us and my x is going to be positive here because i'm in quadrant one so look at the quadrant that it says your angle is in to determine whether to take the positive or the negative square root in our case because we know we're quadrant one x has to be positive there i'm going to use positive square root of 16 or just positive four now from there we can figure out the rest of the things that we need all the other trig functions we know what sine of alpha is already but now we could figure out cosine of alpha so cosine of alpha is x over r we know that from a long time ago but now we can really see it it's going to be four-fifths likewise tangent is y over x so we know that would be three over four now when we get down to working through sine of alpha plus beta when we use our formula which we can do when we get to sine of alpha we'll know it when we get to cosine alpha well no is four fifths so we get a tangent alpha we'll know it that's three-fourths without actually ever knowing what that angle is in fact which is kind of cool we're going to do the same exact thing for cosine beta so cosine beta says hey you've got 2 square root 5 over 5 but remember beta is between negative pi over 2 and 0. negative pi over two to zero remember this is negative pi over two same thing as three pi over two but going in an opposite uh orientation of your angle so negative or clockwise so negative pi over two to zero is quadrant number four we wanna look at that first so let's write down quadrant four we also need to understand what cosine tells us cosine tells us x over r on a unit circle it's the x coordinate itself why because it's a unit circle and the radius would be one it'd be x over one but in general it's the x distance along the x axis divided by the radius of of your angle not creating that triangle or a point on a circle with a radius of whatever that r is so for us we know that's x over r so if that's true if that's x over r then i know i could draw a picture of that but we're also in quadrant number four now what happens in quadrant four x's are positive and y's are negative well that's possible with that x that's two square root five and with that r we can get a a positive x with an r in quadrant four but think about what sine is going to be sine is going to have to be a negative value because our y values are all negative in quadrant four so we're going to draw this we're going to do it in the appropriate quadrant so x is 2 square root 5 and r is 5. so we've drawn the triangle that represents beta with an x of 2 square root 5 and a radius of 5. this would create some big circle with a radius of 5 and this would be a not a unit circle but a 5 circle or something and that is what cosine of beta represents for us now what do we have to do in order to find sine and tangent you got to know what the y is so we're going to use pythagorean theorem again just be very careful what you're actually solving for remember we're solving for y so that we can find sine of beta and tangent of beta but look at what y is going to be because y is in quadrant number well because the beta is in quadrant 4 our y has to be negative that's what all angles in quadrant 4 are going to do they're going to have negative y values we can see that right here y was important to know quadrant 4. well because if you didn't know that you could have written another angle beta with an x of 2 square root 5 and a radius of 5 and had quadrant 1. so we had to limit where we were so we have a definite sine and tangent of that particular angle so we didn't know the quadrant in order to even do that so let's go ahead and do pythagorean theorem we'll see what our y value is so we have x squared so we know our x we also drew a picture of it so i'm looking here thinking x squared plus y squared equals r squared and we're going to go ahead and solve for y remember that when you square a product you square both both factors in there so we want to make sure that we square the 2 and we square the square root of 5. 2 squared is 4 and the square root of 5 squared is just 5. so 2 squared 4 square root of 5 squared is just 5 that's going to be 20. so our y squared equals 5. now when we take a square root of that you have a choice to make but it's not a hard choice because you already know what it's told you you already know that beta is in quadrant four what are all the y values in quadrant four what is sine in quadrant four well that's negative so if i know that i'm in quadrant four my x is positive and my y's are negative so i'm gonna have to choose not the positive square root of five but the negative square root of five i hope you're seeing why it's really important to know what quadrant your angle resides in because it determines what your x values are positive or negative and what your y values are positive or negative that will dictate whether you're going to have a positive or a negative sign tangent and cosine so our y is going to be negative square root 5 because we are in quadrant 4. just like our our x's and y's were both positive here because we're in quadrant number one so what we're going to do now is we're going to take a take a look at what we need to find if we knew cosine of beta we'll know that already let's find sine of beta and tangent beta because we already gave our y value a sign it will it will determine the signs of sine and tangent as well so sine of beta says hey here's your beta we already have that we now know that y is negative square root 5. sine takes y over r so square root 5 over 5 but negative because we're in quadrant 4. tangent takes y over x well we know that we know that's negative square root five that's our y over two square root five it might be tempting to rationalize but please simplify before you rationalize every time square root of 5 is square root of 5 they cancel you're going to get negative one-half so now that we've done that now that we've found all of our appropriate trig functions sine cosine tangent of alpha sine cosine tangent of beta now we can find the things they're actually asking us for so find sine of alpha plus beta find cosine alpha spin and find tangent of alpha minus beta so here's what we're going to do we're going to write out the formula appropriately using the signs that we appropriate like we know and then we're going to plug in or evaluate for every trig function we have we'll have it somewhere up here which is really nice that means without actually knowing alpha or beta we can use the representation of our coordinates so that that ratio and just substitute that in so let's be really careful with the formulas and write that out right now so sine of alpha plus beta if i remember right i use this formula here it says plus plus i'm going to have sine alpha cosine beta plus cosine alpha sine beta so i want to make sure that i've got that right i'm following my signs plus gives us plus sine alpha cosine beta we got that plus cosine alpha sine beta i've got that too now because we've already done the work ahead of time all we have to do is find these things so sine alpha i know that that's three fifths cosine beta i know that one that's two square root five over five three fifths two square five over five plus i got my plus now cosine alpha and sine theta cosine alpha is four fifths and sine beta is negative square root five over five so i'm just substituting that in there if we do just a bit of simplification we notice that we have a common denominator of 25 so that's going to be 6 square root five minus four square root five all over twenty five and because we have that common radical we can just subtract them so 2 square root 5 over 25 that's about it that's exactly what sine of alpha plus beta will give for you so why why these examples are are fairly important is they really make you practice using formulas correctly but they also make sure you understand the interplay between taking a square root with a positive and negative like a plus and minus and knowing what quadrant you're in it's very important when we get to things like uh trigonometric substitution things like that to know where we are when we're drawing triangles and doing substitutions you'll get there in calculus 2. it's important to understand the trigonometry behind it so let's move on to cosine alpha plus beta we're still going to use the formula you should honestly try right now see if you can get the appropriate signs that come out of that formula see if you can make our substitutions and simplify all the way down of course i'm going to do that right now but cosine alpha plus beta says we're going to take cosine alpha cosine beta our sines are going to be reversed so so cosine alpha cosine beta a plus is going to yield a minus between these two products here so cosine alpha cosine beta minus sine alpha sine beta now we've just got to find those things so i'm double checking i've got my plus and my minus cosine alpha sine alpha sine theta that's fantastic cosine alpha is four-fifths cosine beta is two square root five over five make sure i put my minus there sine alpha well sine alpha is three fifths so notice even without knowing what alpha is we're just doing a substitution we already know what sine of alpha is well that's what that's asking for we know that's equal to three-fifths we can substitute that in that's exactly what we're doing here is just finding what our expression is equal to and substitute it for a formula so sine alpha is three-fifths and sine beta is negative square root five over five with a little bit of simplification hopefully we can see we get 8 square root 5 over 25 plus 3 square root 5 over 25 that common denominator let's make one fraction we end up getting 11 square root 5 over 25 let's do the last one so tangent of alpha minus beta of course i'm leaving out the sine alpha minus beta cosine alpha minus beta but i'm hoping that you can see it's the same idea i just wanted to give you all three trig functions common trig functions with at least one iteration of those these formulas so tangent of alpha minus beta again we're going to look at our formula usually i let students have that because it's difficult to memorize every formula you're going to get in trigonometry and it's kind of crazy so tangent of alpha minus beta we got to follow the sign down so tangent alpha minus beta says minus is on the bottom we're going to use the bottom signs here so tangent alpha minus tangent beta but one plus tangent alpha tangent beta in my opinion it's a lot easier to do all this work right up front so you're not really having to go back and backtrack and find them but that's just my opinion you can really do this any way that you want you can write these all out and find them individually if you'd like but it's just kind of nice to get this all figured out and just go on a roll and finish them all at once that's how i like to do it so let's take a look at these things all we need to know is what tangent of alpha is we've already found that that's three-fourths tangent beta we've already found that it's negative one-half so we're just going to write those down keep in mind it's super easy to make sign errors so like tangent alpha that is three-fourths but you're going to subtract a negative usually we show those things in parentheses because parentheses maintain operation and they maintain sign so we know we're subtracting a negative we're going to end up adding one-half over 1 plus these two fractions get repeated that's tangent alpha and tangent beta no don't cancel i know you want to sometimes you just want to cancel now but if we could do that we would made that formula a lot easier from the beginning we cannot cancel that out so three-fourths plus one-half over one plus three fourths times one half go slowly to not make some mistakes here so three-fourths plus one-half haven't done that yet and then one plus negative three-eighths because we multiply numerators and denominators means one minus three-eighths so let's see this is going to give us three-fourths plus two-fourths is five-fourths eight eighths or one minus three-eighths 5 8. and however you want to simplify that you can you can multiply it by an lcd if you'd like multiply by the reciprocal which is what i'm going to do we end up getting just two so i hope that makes sense i hope especially you're seeing the condensed version of our formulas and be able to understand the signs there also hopefully you get the most part of the most important things is figuring out where your angle is quadrant one two three or four because that determines what you can do with x and with y as far as your signs go your r is almost always positive there are some cases um like in polar coordinates where we have a negative r and we'll be reflecting that about the origin uh but i just want to point that out that most of the time our r is going to be positive so i'm going to do one more very similar to this because it has a very awkward quadrant then we're going to start exploring a couple different ideas let's get started on another one so we've got kind of the same idea but a very awkward quadrant so at least an awkward quadrant representation and a very awkward thing in an okay quadrant so number one we think we want to do if we're asked to find a variety of problems that involve different trig functions we don't know and we're not given an angle we're just given a a a ratio that that trig function of angle equals find the other trig functions first so you're going to be dealing with a lot of the stuff let's find cosine and tangent let's find sine and cosine of those given angles alpha and beta in the appropriate quadrant so first thing find the quadrant so let's take a look at what negative 3 pi over 2 to negative pi actually means negative angles sweep out clockwise so if this is if this quadrant is negative 3 pi over 2 that's negative pi over 2 negative pi negative 3 pi over 2 to negative pi so negative pi over 2 negative pi negative 3 pi over 2 negative 3 pi over two to negative pi is actually quadrant two so we're in quadrant two now think about what quadrant two does quadrant two has positive y values and negative x values so when we get to the pythagorean theorem we're going to be making sure that when we take a square root we're taking the negative for our x so we're going to sign this so we know that sine alpha is y over r and that means that we can find our x values so we're going to draw a picture of this if our y value is 5 positive 5 and our r is 13 remember we could do positive 5 and 13 this way or positive 5 and 13 this way but quadrant two makes us so we do this one and not that one so positive five and 13. let's go ahead and do pythagorean theorem let's figure out what that x is because that's going to yield cosine of alpha and tangent of alpha for us so x squared plus 5 squared equals 13 squared eventually we're going to get down to x equals plus or minus the square root of 144. this is why it was so important to understand the quadrant because in quadrant two our x's are negative yes we have two choices but only one was the right choice only one of them will satisfy being in quadrant two that and that's where our angle alpha resides so we know that we've got to take the negative square root of 144 or just negative 12. x's are negative in quadrant two that that one thought of like what your variable is doing what your x's and what your y's are doing in each quadrant really help you to decide which one is the appropriate choice so quadrant two x's have to be negative i'm going to take negative 12. now that we have that we can really easily find cosine of alpha and tangent of alpha so cosine alpha takes x over r which since we have our triangle drawn that's really nice so x over r we got that tangent of alpha takes y over x oftentimes you'll see people do this also if your x is negative uh 5 divided by negative 12 is the same thing as negative 5 over 12. i should use that right up there but we oftentimes don't like to see negatives on denominators so y over x if your x is negative you can easily move that negative to the front of your fraction or even the numerator so negative 5 12 is perfectly appropriate now we'd be able to fill out a lot of these things right here like for tangent and for cosine of alpha let's go ahead and find sine and cosine of beta so that quadrant's not that bad so that quadrant says that your beta is somewhere between pi over 2 and pi so where is pi over 2 pi pi over 2 is positive first off so counterclockwise pi over 2 to pi it's saying beta is somewhere between pi over 2 and pi well that's in quadrant number two some thoughts start floating through our mind what happens in quadrant two y's are positive x's are negative in quadrant two y is positive x is negative for this piece of the puzzle so when we do this we're going to keep that in mind when we start drawing this this picture of our angle so if tangent beta is negative square root of 3 remember what tangent does tangent takes y over x then wait a minute what's our x well right now if you wrote the fraction you're probably thinking one y would be negative square root of three and x would be 1. but wait this is really important i hope you catch it if you actually do that if you go to y is negative and x is positive you're in quadrant 4. this is the main deal with tangent tangent is negative in both quadrants two and quadrant four well if we're residing in quadrant two it's not okay to have a negative y because in quadrant two y is positive it's not okay to have a positive x because in quadrant two x is negative so when this happens with tangent assign the negative where it needs to go so what i mean by that is if you know you're in quadrant two your y is going to be positive and your x has to be negative fractions don't know the difference for a negative numerator or a negative denominator what that means is that we can think about this as negative square root of three over one or positive square root of three over negative one that's the one that fits quadrant two so you really might have to think about where this angle is and what manipulation of your sign makes it happen for us we know that negative y does not work for quadrant two so i'm going to think about this as positive square root of three over negative x does that still make the same ratio well yeah it's still negative square root of three but it fits our quadrant matter so y is square root of three and x is negative one that puts us squarely into quadrant number two now we can find r and that's going to allow us to find sine and cosine of beta so when we take negative 1 squared we're going to get 1 square root of 3 squared gives us 3 and when we take a square root we're going to get r equals plus or minus the square root of 4. which one do we take we want to keep r positive because it will keep us in the same quadrant so your x's and your y's really put you in the correct quadrant all right so that r we don't really ever take the negative because if we did take negative r what that would do is that would swing us all the way back into quadrant four which is what we're trying to get away from in the first place so in general you you really just keep the positive when you're dealing with with this type of trigonometry so rr is two and that really does bear out for sine and cosine when you look at what it should be for quadrant two in quadrant two sine should be positive and cosine should be negative tangent should also be negative we see that but if we had a different r we would be switching one of those or two of those so sine beta says take your y over your r that's square root 3 over 2. cosine beta says take your x over your r that's negative one half man this one actually from the beginning we probably could have figured out what the angle even is because tangent of tangent beta equals negative square root of three that's actually on our table sine beta equals square root of three over two notice how that's in quadrant two that's positive cosine beta equals negative one half that's in quadrant two that's negative that makes sense uh we could figure out that data maybe do that but for us we don't actually have to we have everything lined out to be able to fill these out really really nicely so if we were trying to find sine of alpha plus beta and we know that sine alpha cosine beta plus cosine alpha sine beta we know sine alpha we know cosine beta we know cosine alpha we know sine beta which can fill that out so sine alpha is 5 13 cosine beta is negative one half cosine alpha that's negative 12 13. sine beta is square root 3 over 2 we're going to simplify a little bit we're noticing that we get a common denominator this happens very frequently that's going to be well let's see 13 times 2 is 26 so negative 5 over 26 minus 12 square root 3 over 26 there's not much we can really do to simplify that it just stays as ugly as that is unless you can factor something and simplify it you're going to leave that let's do the same thing down here so cosine alpha plus beta we already have the formula lined out cosine alpha is negative 12 13. cosine beta is negative one-half minus we've got to get our sign right sine is alpha is 5 13 and sine beta is square root 3 over 2. so i'm getting a positive 12 over 26 minus 5 square root of 3 over 26 it might be tempting to simplify this but then we lose our common denominator and it's nice to see this as one fraction not super necessary but sometimes kind of nice all right tangent last one so we take we took care of tangent tangent alpha is negative 5 12 tangent beta is negative square root 3. alright so we have negative 5 12 plus square root of 3 once we simplify and we have 1 plus negative 5 12 times negative square root 3 that's positive 5 square root of 3 over 12. now what what to do here because it's pretty ugly this is one of those cases where it might be nice just to multiply everything by the lcd so let's multiply both the numerator and distribute and denominator and distribute by that 12. so let's go ahead and do that now so we have 12 hey that cancels that's negative 5. we have 12 that's 12 square root of 3. 12 times 1 is 12 12 cancels here and we get 5 square root of 3. as much as we want to simplify that you might be able to rationalize the denominator but that's about it nothing there actually cancels out so i'm going to leave it there if you want to rationalize you multiply by the conjugate of the denominator and distribute that all right so easier one involving inverses and then tougher one involving inverses so what to do and what not to do when you're dealing with sine of stuff that's added together with inverses firstly could you distribute sine into here no sine is an operator it's it's not a a value so you can't just distribute this and get sine of this plus sign of that it doesn't it doesn't work that way that's why these formulas exist because if you could do that you could do sine of alpha plus beta would be sine of alpha plus sine of beta well that's not true sine of alpha plus beta is all of this crap right here so it's it's not like we can just say i'm going to distribute it it's non-distributable that's why the formulas exist so we have to really work on this before we can even touch that now does it does it makes sense does this actually make sense what do inverses give you sine inverse of one half says sine of what angle gives you a relationship of one over two for y over r so this is talking about an angle so it's that one so inverses give you out angles remember that sine of angles give you out points or relationships of points and inverses sine inverse of points give you angles so sine of stuff that is angles actually does make sense so what do you do firstly if you can figure these out explicitly do it it'll save yourself a lot of time and we can do that here you see sine inverse of one-half must equal some sort of an angle and that only works if sine of that angle equals one half so sine inverse of one half is an angle inverses give you angles but this is true if and only if sine of alpha gives you one half so where does sine of alpha equal one-half what angle gives you at a y-coordinate on a unit circle of one-half remember we're back to a unit circle right now that's only time inverses work is on a unit circle and they only work on the restricted domain for sine inverse oh i hope you remember sine inverse works from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. so when we're asking this question sine inverse of one half equals alpha it's what angle gives you a y coordinate of one half because that's sine but only from negative pi over two to pi over two so sine alpha equals one half what angle gives you out a y coordinate one half but only from negative pi over two to pi over two well let's see got to be pi over 6. now remember what we did we just called sine inverse of one-half alpha we just found alpha alpha is pi over six so what that means is this piece is now alpha that's going to be pi over six let's find cosine inverse of zero remember these don't have to be the same angle so we're going to call it something different like theta conveniently cosine inverse of zero equals beta if and only if cosine of beta equals zero but remember remember about cosine cosine inverse only works on the unit circle and it only works from zero to pi so we're asking what angle gives you an x coordinate of zero on a unit circle but only between zero and pi well that's got to be pi over two pi over two has an x coordinate of zero that's not a tube so we asked hey sine inverse negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 what angle gives you a y coordinate of one half that's pi over six and we said cosine inverse that's zero to pi what angle gives you an x coordinate of zero uh that's going to be an angle of pi over 2. so we have this we already called cosine inverse of 0 beta beta we just found that so cosine inverse of 0 is pi over 2. so we can change your problem now instead of just having sine of something that we don't know we now know those angles now could you add those together you could and sometimes it's worth doing because if it's still on your unit circle that's absolutely just fine so pi over 6 plus pi over 2 let's see that's 3 pi over 6 that's going to be 4 pi over 6 or 2 pi over 3. so you could you can totally do that do you have to no you don't and sometimes it doesn't work very well that you have two different angles that add together and still need a circle sometimes that doesn't happen and so often times we'll just use the formula right from here i'm going to because i want you to practice but keep in mind you could add this and if it's still in the circle that's okay to do so we've got our formula all worked out we have sine of the first cosine of the second plus cosine first sine of second that's what our formula says to do we have the sines the same for sine now we're going to use our unit circle so sine of pi over six that's going to be one half cosine of pi over two we already know that that's going to be zero cosine of pi over six that's square root three over two sine of pi over two is one so one half times zero is zero plus square root of three over two times 1 is just square root 3 over 2. now what if we had added them this adds together as 4 pi over 6 or 2 pi over 3. and sure enough sine of 2 pi over 3 is exactly square root of 3 over 2. so it does work if you add them together provided that is still on the unit circle if it's not then this is the way to go so it's two options either one is really just fine that can save you some work sometimes though so i hope that makes sense what i'm going to do now is come back with another one where these things are not just easy to find where this is not on your unit circle i'll show you how to walk through that all right so last one before a couple proofs of what i said i'm going to do in and teach you that sine and cosine not just graphically but literally are phase shifts of one another so i'm going to show you that just a little bit some proofs and some interesting um kind of formulas identities that we can use from here on out so it looks really similar to the last type of example and at first glance we really want to do the same way we want to say hey that's an angle that's an angle that's great those add up cosine of that easy peasy but that's not a new circle and neither is that one so what we can't do man don't distribute that it's not going to help you anyway but we have to find some way to represent that and that as an angle so here's the thought process if i can represent this as an angle then tangent of that angle equals four thirds that's something i can draw that's something i can find sine and cosine for that particular angle same thing here i can write that as an angle cosine of that angle because i have an angle equals 5 13 that's something else i can draw that's something to find sine and cosine 4. well if i do that then i can take cosine of alpha plus beta whatever those angles are and use a formula and using my pictures i can plug in some fractions that represent the ratios given sine of alpha sine of beta cosine alpha cosine beta so let's set this up as an angle first so starting from the beginning hey those are inverses let's call them an angle if they're not on the unit circle we're gonna have to draw a picture of it so tangent inverse of four thirds equals alpha inverses give you out angles but this is only true if tangent alpha equals four thirds now we're about to draw a picture but remember this tangent inverse only works from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. why well because there's two places on a unit circle where tangent's positive and two places on the unit circle a tangent is negative but if i restrict it from negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 there's only one quadrant where tangent's positive and one quadrant or tangent's negative so if tangent's positive from negative pi over two to pi over two it has to be quadrant one where that's happening not quadrant three that's off limits for tangent inverse so this angle must be in quadrant one i need to see that do you see that because we're tan inverse we're somewhere from here to here because tangent's positive that is in quadrant one that's a positive y and a positive x that's only quadrant one i can't assume it's a negative x and a negative y which would still give us positive four thirds because we can't be in quadrant three for tangent inverse so this is y over x saying we're going to have y of four x of three and we can certainly find our r for that we almost exclusively keep r positive so we're going to take positive 5 here and we're going to keep on going we're going to find cosine of alpha and sine of alpha why why in the world would you do that we'll get really get this we just call this equal to alpha so this whole thing right here is alpha that there is going to be beta in just a minute but we're going to have cosine alpha plus beta we've got a formula that shows us that so if we have cosine alpha plus beta we can write this as cosine alpha cosine beta minus sine alpha sine theta if we can just find sine and cosine of alpha we can fill out that formula when we get there so let's go ahead and find sine and cosine of alpha sine takes y over r so that's four fifths so sine alpha is four fifths cosine alpha takes x over r so three fifths and we're ready for that one so cosine inverse of 5 13. let's call that beta so inverses give you angles but that's only true of cosine beta equals 5 13. now we all know about cosine cosine beta cosine alpha equals 5 13 and that's x over r so x is 5 and r is 13 but think about where cosine inverse works cosine inverse only works from 0 to pi you see there there's two quadrants or cosines positive and two quadrants or cosines negative and so if we left this alone we would be able to draw two different pictures here we can't let that happen so cosine here is positive the only positive quadrants from zero to pi pi is quadrant one so this is in quadrant one that's a positive x and a positive r in quadrant one so let's draw that obviously not to scale all that really matters and i hope that you're seeing it that understanding the quadrant is very important for what we're doing here we have to have the right angle in the right quadrant so that we can find the right signs for the rest of our trig functions like positive or negative for the y positive or negative for the the x always positive really for the r so we said hey cosine inverse works from zero to pi because it's positive the only quadrant from zero to pi where cosine's positive is quadrant one we have to draw this in quadrant one and we have done that uh you can't make it quadrant four because cosine inverse doesn't work in quadrant 4. that would have a positive x and a positive 13 positive r but it wouldn't be appropriate because that cosine inverse system would work there so now we're going to go ahead and find y if we take plus or minus the square root of 144 we gotta understand that this is in quadrant one and the y is going to be positive in quadrant one so we can see it sine is also positive in quadrant one so we know that we need to take the positive there that's positive 12. now we already have cosine of beta but we certainly want to find sine of beta which in our case is 12 13. question why aren't we finding tangent of alpha and beta well we have tangent alpha already why don't we care about tangent beta look at your trig function our trig function is cosine cosine of alpha we have a picture for alpha and beta we have a picture for beta the formula for cosine of alpha plus beta has absolutely nothing to do with tangent so we don't need it it'll not come into play now if that had been tangent then yeah for sure we would have needed that but we don't hear so so all we've done really just a little recap is that was an angle that's called alpha find a picture and find sine and cosine because you're going to need it later call that an angle draw a picture and find sine and cosine because you're going to need it later for that formula now because this is alpha and that's beta let's use cosine of alpha plus beta to write our formula out so i have cosine alpha plus beta cosine alpha cosine beta minus sine alpha sine beta and we have all of this stuff right here so cosine alpha that's three fifths cosine beta that's 5 13 minus sine alpha that's four fifths sine beta that's 12 13. we can do a little bit of simplification but it might not be great to do that because if we simplify this we can't simplify that and we lose our common denominator so that looks like that is 65 as a common denominator so 15 minus 48 over 65. all in all that's negative 33 over 65 it's kind of ugly but you can't simplify that and that's really all there is to it kind of a weird little example that says hey cosine of this angle what what's that it mean the x-coordinate of something on a unit circle with this angle that we don't even know made up of two inverse functions added together would be an x coordinate of negative 33 60 fifths on a unit circle so hopefully you found it quite interesting at least it's really good practice so what we're going to do now is i'm going to show you those proofs of how sine and cosine are really actually fascists also these formulas are great for identities moving forward okay so last little bit these are some very standard identities that you get in any textbook those are not those ones i'm going to show you because this proves the phase shift idea but you're really going to want to make sure you understand these two they come up quite often they're a way that you can change from cosine to sine or sine cosine same same with those you can do it so i'm going to prove them i'm going to show exactly what this is it's really just using our sum and difference formulas for cosine and sine and then sine and cosine again so let's go through let's let's really see what's going on here so if i have cosine of pi over 2 minus theta you could really think about that as a difference of two angles inside cosine let's use the the difference formula for cosine so cosine pi over 2 cosine theta different sine so plus sine pi over 2 sine theta that's what our formula says now cosine of pi over 2 is 0. so this whole thing 0 cancels out cosine of pi over 2 is 0. what about sine of pi over 2 sine of pi over 2 is 1. so wait a minute if we use the difference formula for cosine then cosine of pi over 2 minus theta is actually equal to sine we just proved it and that's a very nice identity to use honestly we can prove this one directly from here if we took this and reversed our terms factored out a negative and used the fact that cosine is even to say opposite inputs give you equal outputs it doesn't matter whether that's a negative or not that's still going to give you outside now i'm going to prove it with the difference formula again maybe you can do it on your own but that's also going to equal sine theta this is going to equal well let's see let's figure out our formula sine of pi over 2 minus pi minus theta all right so sine of pi over 2 cosine theta so sine of the first cosine of the second keep the same sign for this difference formula for sine then cosine of the first side of the second we have that down sine of pi over 2 is 1. we know that cosine of pi over 2 is zero that takes care of that whole term there that means that we're going to get just cosine of theta so if we ever have pi over 2 minus an angle sine of pi over 2 minus that or if you can write it that way sine of pi over 2 minus that angle is going to equal cosine of whatever your theta is same thing here cosine of pi over 2 minus theta is going to equal sine of whatever that theta is every time now this is going to prove our phase shifts so sine of theta plus pi over 2 try it on your own all right i've gone ahead and written those out so sine of theta cosine pi over 2 plus cosine theta sine of pi over 2 cosine pi over 2 is zero this whole thing is gone sine of pi over two is one giving us cosine theta something very similar happens here cosine pi over two is zero this is gone plus sine of pi over two is one leaving a sine of theta now appreciate this appreciate the graph with what that says you just need to remember your transformations do you remember that whenever you add or subtract something inside the parentheses next your input inside input means you're moving left or right so you're affecting the input now how does it affect it if we add to that input it actually shifts our graph left if we subtract from the input it actually shifts our graph right so here's what this says cosine is actually just the sine function shifted to the left pi over 2. the cosine here is in verbal if you take sine and shift it left pi over two this whole thing goes boop you actually get cosine this is sine and that's cosine now take a look at this one it says cosine theta minus pi over two equals sine theta here's what this says sine theta is if you take cosine and shift it right pi over 2. if you take cosine shift it right pi over 2 you're going to get sine here's cosine it's purple if you shift it right pi over 2 you're going to get cosine this is like algebraic proof that cosine and sine are just phase shifts of one another they give you the same graph but they're off by pi over two so you need to take cosine and shift it right to get sine or likewise take sine and shift it left to get cosine that should make sense they're phase shifts of one another and now we've finally got to prove that because we have a couple formulas of lettuce so i hope this video has made sense um whoever really hammered down on what uh sine and sum and difference formulas for sine and cosine and tangent r i hope you've enjoyed it and i'll see you for another video
