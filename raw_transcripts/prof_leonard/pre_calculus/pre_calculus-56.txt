Transcript for: Graphing Logarithms with Transformations (Precalculus - College Algebra 56)
all right so we're going to graph some logarithms very quickly there's only two examples uh and there were Transformations and the reason why there's only two is because we've done transformation so many times this is just one more of our basic graph shapes and having graphed some exponentials we should have a pretty good idea about what our key points are but switched and what our asmp tootes are but switched and so we're applying that logic to some logarithms and just getting these pictures on some new graphs so what I'm going to do is I'm going to refresh remember on what the graph of a logarithm looks like what the domain what the ranges what the key points are and then apply that to two examples um with logarithms we do need to absolutely understand that a logarithm is the inverse of some sort of an exponential so exponentials are always increasing so are logarithms or always decreasing and so are logarithms just a little bit different uh our logarithms always have a domain before we shift it of positive numbers so our X values all have to be positive in order for us to evaluate inside of our logarithm we get out all real numbers sure but our domain is always positive until we start shifting that we're going to see that play along here our key points are always always one Zer and and a comma 1 that stems from whatever our base is and that comes from the fact that with exponentials that's what we got but we got 01 and 1 a so reverse that we have our inverses 1 comma 0 and AA 1 for every exponential before we start shifting that and likewise we have a horizontal ASM toote at zero for exponentials and therefore we have a vertical ASM toote at x equals z for our logarithms so our graphs look about like that here's our key points 1 Z A1 here's our vertical ASM toote key points of one Z A1 depending on whether a is greater than one or less than one we have this increasing or decreasing graph we know that because if a is more than one then our key point of a comma 1 would be to the right of one if a is less than one our key point of a Comm would be to the left of one that would give us an increasing or decreasing graph because the output would be one in both those cases so a more than one one a less than one one gives us that look so let's move on let's talk about our logarithms we'll talk about putting them in the right order I'm going to use key points in our shifting for our transformations to graph these things pretty quickly so number one thing with every function you really do want it in order so that we can identify some of the Transformations so so while we might be able to do it here it's going to look a bit better if we put our logarithm first all of our functions that we deal with have the same type of look for Transformations anything with in the function is a horizontal shift anything after the function is a vertical shift anything in front of the function is a reflection or vertical stretch of compression so when we take a look at our logarithm same things happen so here's how I want you to think through it I want you to think this is a logarithm yeah it is it has a base of e you need to know that if it's a logarithm I have some key points let's write our key points our key points are always 1 Z and the base comma 1 now that may be a little confusing if you have a base you need to know that base is e our key points are 1 Z right there and whatever the Bas is comma 1 our BAS is e comma 1 in your head just use 2.7 as a close approximation for E so when you see e just think 2.7 that's what I want you to do when you're graphing these things so we have one Zer we have e comma one and now we start identifying our shift so we say logarithm all right uh maybe what you should do also is look at your base our base is is it more than one or less than one if our base is e our base is more than one it should look like this unless we start reflecting it so that's important if our base is less than one so a fraction we'd have something like this as our root or basic function I'm not giving you one of these today they happen less frequently than our bases that are greater than one but they do happen I'm just going to focus on when your Bas is more than one you can certainly apply the same techniques that I'm showing you for this not a big deal I'm just getting into the root of the situation here so I've identified logarithm our BAS is e oh we should probably have something like that we've identify our key points one Zer and E comma 1 no problem we have key points with logarithms all the time like that and then we start identifying our vertical shift and then our horizontal shift and then our reflection or stretch or compression so I'm seeing that we've got a shift up of two units and also right one unit so that plus two that's a vertical shift show that show that and show the the right one that minus one so vertical shift horizontal shift of right one show that because here's what happens if every logarithm has a vertical ASM toote in its basic graph shape then when we shift it to the right one it shifts our ASM toote for us and it also shows us that in relation to where where we shifted we treat this like an origin and if you plot your key points from that spot you're going to get a good shape for this graph so we would plot 1 Z but in relation to this one Z is right here notice this is 1 but zero you won't move up or down it's got to be on that horizontal line that's going to happen every time just like this is on your x-axis and that's on your x-axis this is on where you shifted your x-axis and then e comma 1 remember e is about 2.7 so from here 2.71 2.7 one so one Z on the X on the shifted version of your x-axis and 2.7 comma 1 that's like your key point in this situation we've also shifted our vertical ASM toote so we're going to obey that and we've got a pretty good sketch of that graph for very very minimal work this is the way I want you to go through graphing logarithms identify that is a logarithm think about the base really have that base in your head and what picture you should obtain after that identify your key points using your base identify your shifts and any Reflections or transformation or vertical stretch compression and then we plot it with our key points after shifting all right let's try our next one so this I've tried to throw just about everything I could think of at you besides a common log so a common log has a base of 10 but frankly 10's a big number I don't want to grab it so we're going to graph something from the base of three in order to graph these appropriately the first thing we want to do is identify what it is and identify if it's in order so when we look at it we see a logarithm that says okay stop right now and put this in order with your logarithm first so this and this is a little out of order makes it just harder to see what our Transformations really are so we would say this as say -2 log base 3 of x + 1 + 3 so now that we have that in order we're identifying that is a logarithm and it has a base of three right now in your head you should have one of these two pictures if a is more than one which it is it's three we're going to get this look until we reflect it so it should be based on this look so let's think through that that looks like this and then let's identify what our key points are our key points for for logarithms are always the verse of exponentials so in exponentials we get 01 for logarithms we get 1 Z for exponentials we got one comma the base and so for logarithms we're going get the base comma 1 our base here is three okay once we've done that we start to identify any Transformations we have we start with the vertical shift anything after the function after parentheses is going to be a vertical shift so that plus three says you're going to shift your graph up three units that plus one says that's inside the function any anything inside the function that's affecting your inputs is going to affect a shift on the input axis so outside outputs inside inputs this plus one says I'm next to your X I'm going to add one to your inputs that's a shift to the left one we've identified a vertical shift up three a horizontal shift left one remember that's opposite and now we're going to look out front what this out front does that coefficient does two things then negative is a reflection across the x-axis or the shifted version of that and that two is a vertical stretch because an absolute value -2 is greater than two the a it counts as two right here for your your vertical stretch so think through what should happen this graph had a base of three should look like this we've moved it up three let's see uh left one we've reflected it and stretched it so this graph is up left reflected it should look like this have that picture in your head it actually should end up looking about like that graph now how we do how we deal with that how we deal with that -2 because this -2 happens after we evaluate our inputs and we run through logarithm it's going to affect the outputs of our of our logarithm and so the outs of our key Point get affected by that -2 just like every other time we're going to multiply our outputs time -2 not your inputs well that doesn't do anything for one zero that stays the same but it is certainly going to multiply 1 * -2 so we get 1 Z still and then we get 3 comma -2 still okay that's fantastic now we're going to go ahead and we're going to plot this so from our shifted up and left versions of our axes from our new vertical asmp toote and our new where we would consider to graph our key points this acts like the origin we're going to plot 1 Z we're going to plot 3 comma -2 so 3 comma -2 along with the same scale that we have is from this as treated like your origin for your key points 1 2 3 down two that's three -2 as plotted from your shifted graph of course the point 32 is not on this logarithm the actual point is going to be 2 comma 1 but we're using this technique finally your vertical ASM toote plays along whether you reflected the graph or not if you reflect a vertical ASM toote about the x-axis it's the same exact thing and so you have to obey that you also need to points don't you because we don't want to make the mistake of accidentally graphing this logarithm this way it's not that way it's been reflected and stretched it should be this way that's why those two points show that also this does not have a horizontal ASM toote logarithms don't have that oh their range is all real numbers it can't have a horizontal ASM toote let that sink in so this is not going to level out it's going to get to negative Infinity slower but it's still going to get there and so don't make this and I've see that many times like students go oh yeah horizont because I want to um don't do that think back to what your graph does this doesn't have a horizontal ASM toote this continues to positive Infinity albeit slowly but it does does do that so we're going to plot this I don't know exactly where we cross the xaxis if you want to make this a little bit better than the sketch I've done start plugging in values that you can evaluate now what do you mean evaluate we spent a whole long time thinking through logarithms in our head in last video uh so think about things like this what would you have to plug in here to simplify that logarithm well you could do something like um you could do something like two I already have that but you do something like two think about this by plug in two 2+ 1 is three the logarithm asks you three to what power gives you three one that would give you out one that's what logarithms ask logarithms ask you what powers it take to go from here to the argument that's what it asks logarithms represent an exponent that's what they do well we already have that point what would the next value be you'd have to plug in eight plug in eight and you go eight wow 8 + 1 is n if I plugged in8 I valuate 8 I would get 8 + 1 which is n 3 to what power will give you the nine two 3 the 2 power will give you 9 so this whole thing would simplify to 2 -2 * 2 is4 -4 + 3 is 1 the next point would be 8A 1 that's way over there it's off the screen now we just plugged in eight but also look at this what if we plugged in zero man this is important I want you to really see it what if you evaluated zero should we get the three yes yes check it out if you evaluated this for zero last little bit 0 + 1 is 1 wait a minute 3 to what power would give you 1 do you remember that if I evaluate for zero and I get one logarithm of I don't care whatever base you have log base whatever of one is always zero every time 3 to the zero power would give you one any base to the zero power would give you one if you ever have an argument of one your logarithm is going to simplify to zero so this whole thing would be 0 -2 * 0 is 0 0 + 3 is 3 that actually works and that might make this graph a little bit better so I hope that that makes sense I hope that you're seeing the Transformations that we know and love and the technique that I've taught you works all the time it really does I hate teaching stuff that I have to retach later so I gave you that that technique of transformation so that we use it up to and including this and this is the last thing that we actually have to graph in well the college algebra portion precalculus trigonometry we got a lot more graphing and you know what the transformation stuff it still works um so that's going to be very useful for us and we'll see that when we get there but for right now I need you to understand to put things in order identify the logarithm the graph that you're going to get think through your Transformations maybe even label them out this actually has four Transformations up left reflect and vertical stretch uh you should be thinking through what the graph does identify your key points as one zero and the base comma 1 and then multiply if you if you need to multiply the outputs then we do our shifting we put our key points and we we graph it along with our our vertical ASM toote for logarithms or horizontal for exponentials hope it makes sense get some practice in on that and I'll see you for another video when we start solving exponentials with logarithms and solving logarithms with exponentials so here for that video in a little bit
