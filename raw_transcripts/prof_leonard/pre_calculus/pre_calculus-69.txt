Transcript for: Arithmetic Sequences (Precalculus - College Algebra 69)
it's time for us to talk about some very very common different types of sequences and series that are very specific and useful later on in math we're going to talk about arithmetic sequences and then series geometric sequences and then series in the next four videos this video and three more so we're going to start with arithmetic sequences something that's very useful very common in fact you're going to see that we can we can talk about some sequences we've already defined in a different way and it's much much easier so here's what an arithmetic sequence does it's a sequence where the difference between any two sequential terms is constant now here's what it means in plain speed you're adding the same number over and over and over again so you're like adding three three three three you're adding that to every single term now what's it gonna take to do that you need to start with some number that's given and then you need to know what number you're adding over and over and over and over and over again well that number that you're you're adding it's called the common difference why is it called a common difference why are they defined that way because if you take any two terms that are right next to each other and you subtract them it's going to be the same number over and over again that is the number that you're adding to get from term to term let's take a look at one right now so if i went from 2 to 4 10 to 14 to 18 can you identify where we start what's the value of the very first term two you need to start somewhere with it with an arithmetic sequence you have to start somewhere like two and then you need to be able to tell what you're adding to get to the next term and it's got to be the same every term so take a look at this if i take any two sequential terms that's two and six or six and ten or ten and fourteen fourteen eighteen and subtract them six minus two is four ten minus six is four uh fourteen minus 10 is 4 and 18 minus 14 is 4. the number i'm adding over and over and over and over again is called the common difference and in this case it's 4. this is how arithmetic sequences work and how they're structured why are they called arithmetic sounds like arithmetic and arithmetic means adding it's exactly right so we emphasize the wrong syllable when we say arithmetic instead of arithmetic but it's the same idea you're just adding the same number over and over again in this case we start at two we're adding four you could find out any other term in here if you continue the sequence you know it's going to be 22 and 26 and 30 and blah blah blah blah blah blah you do this forever and ever now that's great and that defines a a sequence for us recursively which we've talked about briefly and i'll do it again right here when we talk about odd numbers and we'll define us a sequence recursively for us that's not quite what we're looking for we want to be able to find out any term that we want like i want to find the 100th term and not have to do a whole lot of work to it so here's how we can do that with arithmetic sequences they can always be written as a sub n equals a sub 1 what is that well that's the first term you do need a starting spot for arithmetic sequences to be structured appropriately and you know where you start so find your first term it should be like 2 or 1 that's that example and then n minus 1 times d now why n minus 1 times d if d is the common difference d is the what you're adding to get from term to term well what do i want to be able to do to get to my hundredth term now get this if i want to get to my hundredth term and i know i start at let's say two if i want to do my hundredth term and i start at two burns up one of the terms there are 99 terms to get to the 100th term so i would add 99 common differences not a hundred common differences i got 99 differences but the first term ain't one all right you've burned up that first term you've called it two you're going to add 99 common differences in this case four to get to that hundredth term so if they're always structured that way i hope that makes sense to you i hope you see like if this is the way that arithmetic sequences work your first term counts right that counts as one term how do you do the hundredth add 99 common differences to get to that hundredth if we want to write any arithmetic sequence and we can define it this way it's really easy to do all you need is the first term and the common difference that's 4 and then we can structure appropriately so our arithmetic sequence is structured as let's see a sub 1 that's my first term 2 plus n minus 1 y n minus 1 again n minus 1 is not the same thing as n because this is your first term it counts as something so if i'm going to add up a whole bunch of common differences how i get from term to term check it out how would i get to the third term third term i would add four how many times do i add it once then twice that's one less why is it one less because this counted as one of your terms you didn't add four to get here you you start in a two that counts as one of your terms therefore it takes one away from whatever index you want to end at that's what happens now that's it i mean that is arithmetic it really is that easy identify where you start identify what you're adding or the common difference take two terms subtract them identify that it actually does work here so four four four four four it's going to be added four um and then simplify it because this distributes gives you 4 n minus 4 we would get 4 n minus 2. this will give you the terms of this sequence which is very nice if i want to find the hundredth term right now i wouldn't have to do a 100 i would have to do what is that 90 95 more terms i would just plug in 100. the hundredth term is 4 times 100 minus two that's going to be let's see 400 minus 398. the hundredth term in this sequence is 398. now get this please please do not confuse us with series these are not series we have not added this up we will talk about how to do that but this is not it okay this is just the 398th term it's not adding up the first hundred terms that would have to need summation notation this is not what we're doing or to show that this is a sum somehow this is just the hundredth term here and if you want to write this out you can do it you could do add four a whole bunch of times and you would eventually get to 398. i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing the idea of you're taking four and you're adding it over and over again but if you want to end at the let's say 100 term you need to add 99 fours not a 100 because that counts as your first term there's 99 more to go that's what's going on now do you have to simplify from here to here you really should you should also look at the fact that this common difference becomes not a slope although it is linear it's going to increase the same rate but your coefficient of your your nth your index i would say so that is where your common difference can be found also which is kind of fascinating and not too bad there's really not much more i can explain about this beside identify your first term your common difference and you can simplify what you get out of that let's look at the next one if you remember from our sequence video we defined odd numbers 1 3 5 7 9 as a sequence we did it two different ways the first way we did it was we made 13579 as terms we related it and got that the terms of our sequence should be given by 2n minus 1. just like this if i wanted to find the third term i should be able to plug in 3. well 4 times 3 is 12 minus 2 is 10. that should be its work this also works if i want to find the fifth term i plug in 5 two times five is ten minus one is nine that actually does work but it took us a lot of effort to actually get there if you remember if we know that this is an arithmetic sequence this is a lot easier so i i don't know if you remember that from our sequence video but it took us some time it was kind of a headache because we had to relate it back to even numbers and subtract one if we if we can if we understand this is arithmetic sequence we understand that oh look at this my first term is one i'm adding the same number over and over and over again one plus two plus two plus two plus two or take any two numbers and subtract three minus one is two five minus three is two seven minus five is two now my 7 is 2. that's a common difference i'm adding 2 over and over and over well if we have a first term and we can identify a common difference it is arithmetic we get first term plus n minus one times common difference common difference here is two that is a whole lot less work than what we did with sequences so if we can identify if we can identify that something is a specific type of sequence or series it becomes a lot more predictable we have a lot more formulas for it becomes easier so that's a very important concept to understand is we want to try to classify stuff when you get into calculus 2 you're going to try to classify this as what type of test is going to show me convergence or divergence of this particular series and then we can use that on stuff like well we can use that it's really important that we're able to identify stuff if we can identify arithmetic look how much work it saves us way more work than how we did that with sequences the other thing that we did and i want to refresh it because i didn't really go over it very much but the other thing we did is we defined stuff recursively so can you take and define recursively what recursively means is based on the previous term so for instance if i can define my first term as one can i say what my second term is my second term would be my first term plus 2 my third term so notice that my second term is my first term plus two my third term would be my second term plus two my third term is my second term plus two we can deal with recursive formulas by basing them on previous terms you would just need to know what your starting point is and then a formula to get your next term that's what recursive means it's very similar actually to this except that it doesn't wrap everything up in a nice little package it says in order to find your 100th term you would have to know your 99th you'd have to know all the terms before it that's what recursive does so this is a way to define a recursive formula you basically get a first term and how you find your next term notice that it does work this says start at one i have one what's your next term okay if i wanted to find a sub two i would look at a sub one plus two since a sub one is one that would give me three what if i wanted to find a sub three or how about a sub five maybe if i want to find a sub five i would need to know the fourth term because it says take a look at your previous term and then add one my fourth term was seven seven plus two gives my fifth term of nine that's how recursion works it's looking at the previous terms and doing some manipulation to get that next term so hopefully that makes a little bit of sense as far as a recursive formula goes i just wanted to illustrate it here you do deal with it occasionally so what we're going to do now is we're going to um we're going to come back with one example about kind of a manipulation what if you're given a couple terms can you figure out a formula from it so we'll talk about that okay last example very very common one you see this a lot a lot of homework a lot of tests a lot of people like to ask this question so if you have an arithmetic sequence they're giving you two terms can you find out the formula and then use that formula of course to find out any determinants you want yeah yeah of course otherwise you wouldn't be doing this before i've said nope then we're done video ends that'd be kind of funny i would do that someday but yeah of course we can do this i'm going to show you exactly how to do that one thing to notice here is that if eighth term is 75 and the 20th term is 39 can you have an arithmetic sequence that is decreasing sure you're just adding a negative number that would be subtracting your common difference would be negative and in this case we're going to get that here's the idea behind doing this if you have two terms that are given then what we're going to do is we're going to create a system of equations based on those two terms we're going to write out what those terms are use the things that are missing which is the first term and the common difference you don't know what the first term is here you don't know the common differences here if you did you won't have to do this problem be kind of nice but we don't know those two things that's two unknowns we need two terms to create two equations to solve our two unknowns that's how systems of equations work we're just starting to delve into that right now we'll deal much more with systems of equations after we we do trigonometry so here's what we know we know that the eighth term that's a sub eight we know that the eighth term is 75 eighth term equals 75. well let's do two things with that let's fill out as much of this as we can now we don't know the first term but we do know that n is eight now we don't know d but we do know that the eighth term this represents the eighth term is seventy-five this is one equation with two unknowns that represents half of our system the other thing we don't we know that the 20th term is 39. now we still don't know the first term but we do know that the 20th term would have an n of 20. we still don't know the common difference but we do know that this represents the 20th term and it's equal to 39. i hope that you see the utility in knowing how to solve a system of equations this is one equation with two unknowns another equation of the same two unknowns we can use the two equations to solve for the two unknowns this just helped us set up so what we're going to do is we're going to take a look at this part of it just this and treat that like our system so we're going to simplify a little bit so a sub one plus eight or seven d that's eight minus one d that's seven uh 20 minus one's nineteen and then we're going to find some opposite terms that's how solving systems works is you find some opposite terms when you have two variables and and two equations these would be pretty hard to get to the opposite terms these are pretty easy so choose one of them and multiply by negative one thereby getting opposite terms i'm going to choose a top one because i feel like it's really convenient isn't it then since both all both of these formulas are always going to have a sub 1 you just multiply one of them by negative 1 and you automatically opposite terms so that does change the sign of everything though so negative a sub 1 minus 70 minus 74 negative 75 now we can add that system a sub negative a sub 1 plus a sub 1 is 0 minus 7 d plus 19 d is 12 d and negative 75 plus 39 36 negative 36. so when we divide negative 36 divided by 12 is negative 3. it's okay to have a negative common difference it just means that you are subtracting three and if you did this if you started with 75 and you subtracted 3 12 times you're going to get 39. now just like every other system of equations ever you can solve for one variable but you have to plug it in somewhere to solve for the other one so we've just found the common difference we know it's negative 3 but we need a starting term an a sub 1 to figure out what our formula is and then we're going to use this to plug in and this will be very simple but we need to find that a sub 1. so use either one of these i'm going to use this top equation i'm going to plug in negative 3 because i don't want to multiply 19 times negative 3 and then i'm going to subtract it from 75. so 7 times negative 3 is negative 21. if i add that to both sides we get positive 96. that should make sense if i'm subtracting 3 then my first term should be more than that because i'm subtracting three seven times in order to get there so our first term is 96 by the time we get to our eighth term we'll subtracted three seven times not eight times that's our starting term it takes up one of those terms i'd subtract seven times negative three to get to uh to our eighth term and we would get 75 out of that so now we're going to take this information we have our first term we have our d we now can fill out that formula so our sequence is our first term plus n minus 1 times our common difference of negative 3 which we've already found let's go ahead and distribute so distributing that's minus three n plus three writing this a little bit differently you can leave it like this is totally fine negative 3n plus 99 this is probably more appropriate it doesn't matter which one but let's check a couple of these let's make sure this actually works let's plug in 8. if we plugged in 8 that's negative 24 99 minus 24 this is probably easier to see 99 minus 24 that's going to be let's see 75 oh hey that works this one's also going to work if i plug in 20. so plugging in 20 here 3 times 20 60 99 minus 60 is 39. that works now can we just find a 12 term yeah easily all we have to do is plug in 12. either one will do it plug in 12 here you're still going to get 36 or negative 36. so 99 minus 36 99 minus 36 is 63. that's a bit easier than subtracting three another four times from 75 but if you did it if you subtracted three four times that's subtracting 12 you would get let's see minus 12 that'd be 63 and that's exactly what we get there so either way you want to go but this is definitely easier if you don't have something very close to a term that's given i hope it made any sense i hope you see the utility and having the system of equations it's not all that bad but you do need to know how to structure it otherwise it can be very confusing or start create for yourself a system and then we can find the starting term a sub one common difference d and put it back together simplify just a little bit and then you're done so hopefully i've made arithmetic sequences make sense to you next we'll talk about arithmetic series and then we'll move on to geometric sequences and series have a great day you
