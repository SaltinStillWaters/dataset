Transcript for: Introduction to Polar Coordinates (Precalculus - Trigonometry 36)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video i'm going to teach you about polar coordinates i think why leonard why do you have to teach me about a whole new coordinate system i just got a handle on x y like really good now you got to go screw everything up and tell me about something brand new why do we do that why do we teach you something like x y chord and playing and then all of a sudden throw something like polar coordinates at you you go hey learn this too because it's fun it is fun but honestly it's it's important what happens later on in math is that polar coordinates what i'm going to teach you today can actually make a lot of your math easier especially in calculus 3 some parts of calculus 2 sometimes graphing with polar coordinates is a whole lot easier than x and y why because for things that are not functions that don't pass the vertical line test they actually become functions using polar coordinates which means we don't have to break it up and graph it like piecewise functions we can be really annoying it also makes a lot of calculus easier for certain shapes things like spherical coordinates things like cylindrical coordinates are based on this idea polar coordinates and then we extrapolate from there so learning this number one can be a very very useful tool now can let you graph things that aren't even functions in x and y but r and polar coordinates can make certain uh certain things in calculus 2 and 3 a lot easier so that's that's why we're learning it so what in the world are polar coordinates polar coordinates are a way to graph points without using x and y in a rectangle but instead an angle and a distance and so here's the important things to know about polar coordinates polar coordinates have something called a pole acts like an origin and a polar axis acts like the x-axis and from there we can go positively or negatively a certain angle and then from that pole a distance out positive r or negative r so the key features here are the polar axis is a whole lot like the x-axis it's a horizontal line but it does definitely have this starting spot this this pole that we we treat kind of like an origin so how polar coordinates work is an ordered pair just like x and y but instead of x and y it gives you a distance from the pole from that point gives you a distance from that point along a certain angle that that point makes with the x axis or the polar axis if we take a ray and go out on the angle so so basically we say hey here's where you start go up a certain angle and then go out that distance and you will you will reach a point notice how with a given angle and a certain distance r you'll get a unique point we don't get like several points here we get one point for a given angle and a certain distance from the pole so we're going to practice the heck out of this a lot of examples but here's some things to remember i hope that you remember that positive angles are measured counterclockwise and the same thing happens here if we have a positive angle we'll measure it counterclockwise from a polar axis negative angles are measured clockwise so we measure clockwise from a polar axis positive r is a distance from that pole along that ray that you make really from the polar axis so we use our angle counterclockwise for positive and then from there r is the distance along that ray from that pole negative r would be the distance along that ray in the opposite direction and so we'd measure basically positive r and then reflected about that pole so we're going to practice right now one of the things to remember is that this ordered pair while it is ordered it's not x and y it's r the distance from the pole and theta which is the angle that we make of the polar axis so let's try a few of these things how about like two comma pi over four one of the things that you used to hear is just really the layout like what the coordinates actually mean so when we read two comma pi over four and we say these are in polar coordinates the first number we come to is the r is the distance from that pole now i want you to really recognize that positive r is going to be measured along the angle that you just you have right here negative r will be measured along that angle in the opposite direction of positive r and so we'll talk about that when we get to those those negative r's the second number you get is an angle with that polar axis so positive means counterclockwise and negative means clockwise the first thing i do all the time in polar coordinates is really look at my angle and i find out where i'm at first so if i'm talking about positive pi over 4 and this is my polar axis and that's the pole then i'm talking about from that axis going counterclockwise pi over four that puts us about here i'm also going to show you how to do some of this on a polar graphing system uh so you can find that sort of graph paper just like a graphene with polar coordinates and it pops up but from here we're going positive or counterclockwise power before it's about right there so i know that my angle is given by that number the second coordinate in our polar coordinate system um so that ordered pair says this is the angle you're making with the polar axis i've just done that now along that ray that you have just created you're going to go two units how in the world are we supposed to judge two units right now you're just kind of estimating we're approximating two on that you can be very accurate so i'll show you that in just a minute but we'd say okay let's imagine this is one and this is 2 we would stop right here that point is two units away from the pole and it's made an angle of pi over four with the polar axis this is how we graph polar coordinates it's just a matter of locating what your angle is doing and then going along that that angle that ray that the angle creates the certain r or the distance away from the pole let's switch it up a bit let's talk about negative two comma pi over four now negatives can be a little tricky for students to understand right right at the beginning because what we're really doing is we're going pi over four is an angle and then we're going to reflect about the pole so any time you see a negative r really what it says is graph this like you normally would graph the the counterclockwise angle graph the distance from the pole along that angle along the right and then go in the opposite direction if your r is negative so the whole process here would be okay i've got my negative 2 pi over 4 let's find a ray that's at pi over 4 from the polar axis well that would be such a raid this would be pi over 4 from a polar axis now let's go out positive 2 from there positive 2 from there be about there so what negative 2 does it says okay now that that's positive 2 i'm just going to go in the opposite direction from that if you remember i talked to you a while back about about negative r in some of our our sine cosine tangents remember trigonometry on the unit circle and so if your r is negative it reflects you about the origin if your r is negative here it does the same thing it reflects you about this origin that we call the pole so pi over four comma two it's here negative two says flip me 180 degrees or pi around that that pole that pole right there so we would just extend this the opposite direction and go out the same units this would be negative two comma pi over four you've gone up pi over four and then the opposite direction of that ray from positive 2. it can be confusing until you get the hang of it but this is how these polar coordinates work you use your angle first positive goes along the array you just created negative goes in the opposite direction of the ray that you have just created now is there a different way to look look at that is there a different way to arrive at the same point but with a different angle notice this doesn't contradict what i said about one r and one theta gives you a unique point that's that's true um it doesn't give you two points at the same time that would be non-function but we can arrive at the same point in polar coordinates with different angles as well so instead of going up pi over four and then reflecting from negative two could we get that exact same point with a positive r and a different angle well what if we tried positive two comma five pi over four so from our polar axis we say we wanna go five pi over four man i hope you remember what five pi over 4 would do pi over 4 is here then we'd have 2 pi over 4 that's pi over 2. 3 pi over 4 that's here 4 pi over 4 would make pi think about y 4 pi over 4 is exactly pi so 5 pi over 4 would go all the way to pi and then one additional pi over 4. because our r is positive we would go along that direction of that ray so we'd say okay a long theta two units puts us right about if that's one unit puts us right about here we would end up at exactly the same point that pi over 4 negative 2 does and there's something that we're going to get from this we're going to get that you can adjust our theta there's ways to manipulate it so r theta is exactly the same thing as negative r comma theta plus or minus pi what's that mean in plain english it means that if you add pi to your angle or subtract pi from your angle and reverse the sine of your r you'll end up at the same place let me say that again if you add or subtract pi to your theta it's going to put you 180 degrees or pi on the opposite side of that angle if you reverse your r you'll end up in the same place so for for instance if i add pi to pi over 4 i get 5 pi over 4. if i reverse my sign from negative 2 and to positive 2 i end up at the exact same point exact same point so this is always true r comma theta equals negative r and theta plus or minus pi if you if you go on the opposite side of the pole so add pi and reverse your sign on your r you'll end up at the same place the other thing that we can think of is much like on a unit circle if you just keep on adding 2 pi well you end up at the same point yeah or subtracting 2 pi so r theta also equals r comma theta plus or minus two pi you can just keep on going around and around and around and getting the same point over and over and over again so we can get the same point with different angles and with different r i'm going to recap this for about 30 seconds what i'm going to do is give you a couple more examples and then illustrate how to use this this graphing system on the like polar coordinate graphing system which is kind of nice save yourself from estimating what our angles are which is what we've done right here so the whole thing the all about polar coordinates is they're very useful for graphing non-functions in terms of x and y a lot of different functions and they're used to make math simpler later on so they're valuable to know how they work is is similar to x y coordinates in that you're given two numbers in order and they do a certain thing x tells you how far to go along the x-axis y coordinate told you how far to go on the y-axis and you get a point at that that intersection of x and y we get something very similar here we get from your polar axis go up or go down angularly positive you're going counterclockwise negative you're going clockwise that's the second number the second number will always tell you what angle you need to make with your polar axis from there you'll stop right you'll stop at some angle from there the distance from the pole to where you stop along that that ray that you're creating is given by r so r says once you've done this angle measure measure from the pull out and where that that number stops that is where your point is that's exactly what we've done here so 2 would be the distance from the pole to the point negative 2 that's the distance from the pole to the point remember that while theta is positive counterclockwise and negative clockwise r does something a little bit different r says positive you're going along the ray that the angle makes negative you're going in the opposite direction of that ray so basically you're adding pi to whatever this angle is that's why i've told you this right here you can always graph negative r comma some angle by adding or subtracting pi and getting back to a positive r you always change it like that just kind of nice saves us a little bit of a headache in dealing with negative r that's quite a bit more difficult to deal with let's come back let's try a few more examples and then i'm going to illustrate how to use that all right let's give a few more of these a try how about 3 comma negative pi over 3. so if you're told that these are polar coordinates we can graph them by really understanding the second coordinate first that is the angle that you make with the polar polar axis what's negative pi over 3 remember that positive angles move counter clockwise negan move clockwise so this is telling you from that polar axis i want you to go negatively or clockwise pi over three that's going to drop a third of the way from zero to negative pi and so we're going to do exactly that so negative pi over 3 is about right there so we're saying this is negative pi over 3 then look at your r if r is positive you're going to go along that ray that you just made three units so from this pole out one two three we end up right about there that's one point notice the the ray keeps going but your point stops your point is in one location so the point is negative pi over three you go out three units from there along that ray and you're done this is the location that point now how about 3 comma 5 pi over 3 notice what's happening i'm creating for you the same exact point but we can get there three different ways so if we talk about 5 pi over 3 5 3 is a positive angle we're looking at this saying this is polar i know my r i know my theta my theta is positive so from my polar axis i would go positive or counter clockwise one two three pi over three would be right here five pi over three would be another one pi two pi over 3. so 5 pi over 3 is 1 2 3 4 5. the exact same angle as this now think about this one full revolution is 2 pi 2 pi minus pi over three is five pi over three it's why it gives you this coterminal angle so if we go five pi over three and then from the pole it says hey you're going positive positive three units so i've made my ray i'm going along there one two three that's going to give me the same exact location that point now it's a different angle isn't it so it was done differently but the location is the same this also kind of shows you this it says you're going to get exactly the same point if you add or subtract 2 pi from your angle well that's what we did negative pi over 3 plus 2 pi that's the same thing it's just 5 pi over 3 same location different angle how about 2 pi over 3 as your angle and negative three two pi over three is positive so we're going to measure this from our polar axis positively or counterclockwise two pi over three is one two pi over three about like that however negative r's are a little bit challenging to deal with because you have to remember to go in opposite directions so i would really imagine this to be kind of a dotted line like this is this is my ray but really i'm going to be going in the opposite direction 180 degrees completely different direction well that's this way and i would go along that three units so positive 3 would be 1 2 3 here negative would be in the opposite direction that should make sense negatives are opposite of positives so if positive 3 would have been here negative 3 would be in the complete opposite direction of that 1 2 this would be negative 3. and we get the same location all three times what this tells you and actually you could change it if you if you took and said i want to change my negative to a positive what do i have to do i have to either add or subtract pi okay so let's do that so here's what this says i can change this to a positive but i have to add or subtract pi to do it let's say that i add pi to this if i add pi 2 pi over 3 plus 3 pi over 3 is 5 pi over 3. but i also said you could subtract pi and get the same thing so if i want to change my negative r to a positive all i have to do is add pi or subtract 5 i just added pi i got that same point or subtract pi 2 pi over 3 minus 3 pi over 3 is negative pi over 3. that right there is why there's multiple ways to get to the same point and i hope you see that i hope you see that we can get to the same point in multiple ways because we can take negative r's change them to positives we we have the ability to go across the opposite side of that pole given that negative r so if we just add pi or subtract pi we end up at the same point if you take a different angle with a negative r you'll end up at the same point that can be a little confusing because there's multiple ways to get to the same place but it's also a little bit freeing because you can change if you don't like negative r you could change it to a positive by adding or subtracting pi hope that makes sense to you um right now what i'd like to do is take some of these and do them here so imagine we had 3 comma negative pi over 3. here's how to use a polar coordinate system if it's given to you these circles these concentric circles going out they count as units so typically this would be one two three four five all the way to nine i've given you one half one one and a half two just so you can see uh see a little bit better so i'm counting this as one skip one two skip one three skip one four and then four and a half our angles are also given which is so nice because you don't have to estimate them so let's graph all of these and make sure that we're seeing the same thing how would we graph three comma negative pi over three well firstly locate your angle so if this is your polar axis this is at zero or at two pi negative pi over three would be right down here of course my graph says 5 pi over 3 hey but the way we're getting there is different negative pi over 3 says you are going to go clockwise from your polar axis until you hit that ray now along that ray this one right there we're gonna go down three units so one two three that's it that's where my point is now a lot of times we like to show the polar axis it's right here and we also like to show the ray it's a little bit easier to follow but this would be negative pi over three as your angle and positive three is your array so three comma negative pi over three if we did uh positive 3 comma 5 pi over 3 we're doing the same thing so here's your polar axis we'd go 5 pi over 3. well let's find it clockwise is negative counterclockwise positive so all the way here it's pretty easy to find because they tell you five pi over three and so we go okay all the way around here but we'd still go to the same exact distance from the pole so we've done our angle counter clockwise because it's positive 5 pi over 3 then down 1 2 3 along that ray that 5 pi over 3 makes with a polar axis that's the same exact point this is really nice actually if you're going to do negative r so with negative r we're going to go to the same exact angle that we we showed over here earlier so we're going to go to positive 2 pi over 3 so let's see from our polar axis up 2 pi over 3 is right here so i'm thinking this is the ray that's created by two pi over three i would go up let's let's see three units from there if i would have three units from there that's one two three this would be positive three so how negative three comma two pi over three works is identify your ray i've done it and then negative three is graphed in the opposite direction of that well look at that the opposite direction or 180 degrees or pi difference is along 5 pi over 3 or negative pi over 3 that's what this says right there it says either one of those will give you the same point so this says hey in the opposite direction of 2 pi over 3 is 5 pi over 3 or negative pi over 3 you're just going to put that point reflected across that pole just like that that's going to give you the same exact value and so we moved 2 pi over 3 graphed up 3 and then reflected across the opposite direction okay we're going to work through a couple of them very very fast just to make sure that we're good at graphing this so we can move on a little bit and change from polar to rectangular rectangular polar coordinates and actually understand what we're getting so remember all of these are ordered pairs they start with the r the distance from that pole along the theta the second coordinate the angle that that ray makes with that polar axis so if we take a look at negative two comma zero the angle is second so zero says you are right here on that polar axis now go negative two what the world's that mean that means if you went out along this polar axis or along the ray that you've just created which isn't is nothing besides this so go along to and then reflect that or add pi to it you can always change this also so if you wanted to change the sign add pi so change the sign of your r add or subtract pi either way so if i change that to positive 2 i have to add pi or subtract pi so this would either be positive 2 comma pi or positive 2 comma negative pi and will get you the same location now you are graphing that point but you're using using a different point to actually assess where it's at so okay so negative two comma zero says you have a you have an angle of zero this would be positive two negative two would just be on the other side one two units right there if you wanted to do this this would be positive pi and then go out two units from there one two you're ended up at the same exact place okay how about negative three comma pi use your angle first so pi says we're going to go all the way to here pi radians away from that that polar axis so we've gone an angle of pi now if we had positive 3 it would be 1 2 3. negative 3 says at this point you're just going to reflect this so 1 2 3 we'd actually end up right there so negative negative 3 comma pi says go pi and then reflect on the opposite direction that could you change it could you find this out a different way change the value of your r add or subtract pi to your angle so i changed the sign of my r to positive 3 i subtracted pi that should be the same exact point here's an angle of zero and one two positive three exactly the same how about two comma negative five pi over four are angles second negatives mean clockwise for your polar axis so negative five pi over four you might do some counting remember though that you're just counting pi over four or multiples of that so negative pi over four would be one two three four five this is the same thing as negative five pi over four now along that ray that we've just created from the polar axis negative five pi over four we're going to go along that positive 2. all this this is great i like the positive r because i just have to go along that array so that would be 1 2 right there so we went negative five pi over two and then out two units along the ray that that angle makes with our polar axis can you think right now about what other angle you could use to get that maybe two what could you do well you could take positive 3 pi over 4 and go out positive 2 you could take negative let's see negative pi over 4 and do negative 2 or you could do positive 7 pi over 4 and negative 2. it would all give you the same exact location i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing the interplay when you first see it it's kind of weird hopefully now it's making more sense you understand that the first number is the distance from the pole the second number tells you the angle just like on a unit circle the toughest part is the r negative r's can be a little tricky remember that's the opposite direction of the angle that you're making how about negative 3 comma 120 degrees our angle is 120 degrees which doesn't work all that well on a graph intended for radians but if you remember what 120 degrees is it's actually 2 pi over 3. so if we take a look at our unit circle or you can do your conversion um it's kind of a quick way to do it is to uh to take 180 and 120 and simplify them as a fraction so you would get that what goes into both numbers the largest number what well 60 pi over three is the same thing as 60 degrees this is two of those things so two pi over three so that's going to be 120 degrees right here now we're going to go to that race so from our polar axis we went to 120 degrees but this is negative 3. so i'm thinking yes this would be for a positive r negative r just reverses that so instead of up here at 120 degrees i'm going right across from that right down here at 5 pi over 3 or negative 60 degrees or 300 degrees any of those things and i'm going one two three units so our angle was 120 degrees we're just going in opposite direction of that or go up three one two three and then reverse or change the sign that would be negative three that's the opposite direction uh could you do it differently you could arrive at the same point but this is the one coordinate that they've asked you for we could get the same point by changing the sign of our r now adding or subtracting pi well remember that pi is 180 degrees so if i take 120 plus 180 we're going to get 300. or i take 120 i i subtract 1 8 you're going to get negative 60. that's exactly what this is this is either 300 degrees or negative 60 degrees that's 5 pi over 3. i really hope it's making sense i hope that you're seeing the interplay of negative r and the angle that you're creating with the polar axis right now i'm going to take a look at one more example and then we're going to call it good okay last one often times textbooks ask this to get you to practice and understand the interplay between negative r the opposite direction of r and how to change your angles and arrive at the same point it's very useful for what we're doing later in math so first thing can you plot the point r comma 3 pi over 4. do you understand that 4 is the distance from the pole to your point and 3 pi over 4 is the angle that you make with the polar axis plot your point first so if we take a look at this the first thing we do is identify your angle so positive means counterclockwise i'm going to go to 3 pi over 4. along that ray that we've created we're going to go out four units so that's one two three four so i've used my angle to make a positive angle or counterclockwise angle with the portal axis i've gone out four units along that ray because we had a positive r what if we would have wanted had a negative r you would have done this and then reflected it right down there now this the last three things that we're going to do sort of play on the idea of can you find the same point by using a different angle or a negative r well think about that what if you wanted to keep your r positive but you wanted this angle to be between negative pi over 2 or sorry negative 2 pi and 0. how would you get there remember that you can add or subtract 2 pi and arrive at the same exact point so instead of going this way 3 pi over 4 if you subtract 2 pi you would get there by undoing this a full circle what would that be just subtract 2 pi from your angle if you take 3 pi over 4 and subtract 2 pi you're going to get negative five pi over four now that's kept your r positive that's created an angle between negative two pi and zero now let's see if that's the same point negative five pi over four would take negative one two three four five pi over four that's negative five pi over four and you kept your positive r so you go along that ray it's just measured in the opposite direction the angle is measured in the opposite direction isn't it so negative angle instead of a positive angle this is somewhere between 0 negative 2 pi and 0 negative 5 pi over 4 and the same exact way this point is right there just in a different angular direction now what if you wanted to get to the same point but you wanted your r to be negative and you wanted to remain in 0 to 2 pi so you want to end up there but you want to use a negative r to do it how we change to negative r is by adding or subtracting pi or 180 degrees if you're dealing with degrees so we can do that let's change our r change the sign add or subtract pi now should you add or should you subtract if you subtract pi you're going to be negative that's not what it's asking for this says i want you to keep your angle positive between 0 and 2 pi so if i subtract pi it would put me at negative pi over 4. while that will give me the same point with negative r it's not the directions they've given so i want 0 to 2 pi i want to be actually i want to add pi so if i add pi to this it's going to put me right here at 7 pi over 4. so we can change the sign of our r by adding or subtracting pi we can move outside of a period as or one full rotation or revolution by adding or subtracting 2 pi we just have to follow the directions why didn't we add 2 pi here well we had to subtract so that we fit what they're telling you to do we wanted to add subtract 2 pi to fit from negative 2 pi to 0. here we have to add pi so that we can change the sign of our r but still fit in here so 3 pi over 4 plus pi well pi is four pi over four and so that would be seven pi over four let's see it works if we go to seven pi over four that's all the way right there positive 4 would be 1 2 3 4 units along 7 pi over 4. negative says you're going in the opposite direction that that's the same exact point lastly what if you wanted to keep your r positive but you wanted to be from two pi to four pi so one full revolution about that what would you do you're from zero to two pi here if you want to be from two pi to four pi you'd have to go all the way around this circle one more time you'd have to add 2 pi we can always arrive at the same point by adding 2 pi so 2 pi is 8 pi over 4 that would give us let's see 9 10 11 pi over four now let's see if that works eleven pi over four should move us all the way around the circle one time and then a couple more or three more pies over four so let's count this would be remember positive so positive 11 pi over four one two three four five six seven eight nine ten here's 11 pi over four and we go along the ray that this creates because we kept our positive r that's what it told us to do four units one two three four exact same point so i hope this all made sense i really hope that i've introduced this concept well enough that you can grasp it we did a lot of examples so that you could grasp it that you would understand your polar axis acts like an x-axis and that you start here all the time you have a pole the first thing we do actually is look at the second chord it tells you the angle you're making with that polar axis positive is counterclockwise negative is clockwise like we would expect make our angle first positive r goes along that angle negative r goes in the opposite direction of that angle we can always find the same point by changing the sign of our r and adding or subtracting pi we can always get the same point by keeping our r exactly the same and just adding or subtracting 2 pi she moves a whole revolution around that circle the negative r moves half a circle but then reflects that's really what's going on here so i hope that makes sense i hope i've shown you how to use the polar coordinate system well uh what we're going to do next is we're going to talk about how we can convert from polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates it's not too bad i'll show you that in the next video have a great day you
