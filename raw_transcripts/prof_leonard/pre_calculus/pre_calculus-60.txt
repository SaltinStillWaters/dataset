Transcript for: How to Combine Logarithms (Precalculus - College Algebra 60)
hey there now that we've learned how to expand logarithms we're going to go the other way we're going to combine them so same rules but you've noticed i've written them in a different order i've written them in a way that we can combine so when we see two logarithms with the same base that have been added or two logarithms have been subtracted or a coefficient in front of a logarithm we can combine those into a more condensed version of a logarithm two logarithms being added can create one logarithm that has a product in that argument subtraction creates a quotient inside one logarithm not two logarithms so you divide it that's really important and the coefficient can be moved as an exponent just like before we move an exponent to a coefficient so we're going to practice that this is very very useful for what we're doing when we solve some equations that have logarithms in them it's really really useful to be able to combine those things it's important we have to be able to do it so that's mostly why we're covering this right now so let's get started just like an expansion you'll look for for what's connecting that logarithm we're going to basically undo that idea so we separated products and quotients typically first and then exponents last we did have some options in there but in this case we really don't have any options there's one order in how you combine logarithms number one you take any coefficient that you have and you move it as an exponent in whatever that logarithm whatever's inside of that logarithm so we're going to take a look move our exponents first after that we combine any logarithms that are they have the same base that are being added or subtracted so let's take a look at our first example number one thing when we notice we have coefficients and we have logarithms the same base and we're asked to combine these things move your coefficients first as exponents so that means we have log base 3 of x to the one-half power minus log base 3 of x to the third that's our first step every time after that we look to see if we have added or subtracted logarithms since we have a subtraction we're going to create a quotient inside of one logarithm that's really important we don't do we don't have a logarithm over a logarithm that's not correct this doesn't say that we have log a of m over log a of n says log base a of m over n you see why why it's so important is we're going to have the change of base formula in the next video where we do have a logarithm over a logarithm with the same base that's a different thing that we're going to do with that so since we have log base 3 minus another log base 3 we can create 1 log base 3. with our two arguments of our logarithms being divided now once we've done that it's very very important for us to be able to simplify this so when we simplify when we have common bases being divided you're going to get this most often when you have subtraction two logarithms you need to simplify so three minus one half now you can do one half minus three get a negative exponent move back down to the denominator that's fine but 3 minus 1 half is going to be 2 and a half or 5 halves so we're going to get 1 over x to the 5 halves if you needed to do one-half minus three change it back into one over x to the five-halves to get that that's perfectly fine lastly sometimes you'll be asked to write this as a radical so x to the 5 half's power creates log base 3 of 1 over that's a square root with x to the fifth as its radicand you should put parentheses around this so that we are not confused that that is outside some logarithm that's it so we can combine this as log base 3 of 1 over square root of x to the fifth should we rationalize it maybe we could be asked to do that sometimes we can leave it sometimes we can't really depends on what you're doing with it i'm going to leave that but if you had to rationalize it you could multiply well you could simplify this i guess i am going to show tape x to the 5 half's power is x squared with the square root of x rationalizing means take the radical part and make the power match the root on the denominator we'd have to multiply by a square root to do that this would give you an x squared square root of x times square root of x is x and so we would get square root of x over x cubed inside of that logarithm that's as complete as i can make this problem uh really we could probably have here but i want to show you some other options of how you can see this so if you get this and your answer looks like that and you go what are you wrong nothing nothing they're just they're just manipulating a little bit they're saying x to the 5 power is the square root of x to the fifth i can make x squared and x squared and have an extra x in there simplify both those you get x squared square root of x i can rationalize the denominator and end up getting square root of x over x cubed that's really all all that is the primary thing i'm trying to teach you is how to get from here to here that's the idea let's move on a little bit so the next one we're looking at this we're asked to combine we see a log base four and log base four the first thing we do whenever we're combining logarithms is we're going to move our coefficients as exponents now we don't have one here but we do have a five you move the 5 do you with a negative 5. well you can move this as a negative 5 and change it to a plus and then multiply logarithms together it's really easiest to move the 5 and subtract it's you're going to get the same thing it's a lot easier to do so don't mess around with moving this with the sign unless you unless you only have one logarithm and it is negative sometimes we can do that and it's helpful but in general just move this as a power five so we're going to do that first notice what we're not doing we're not factoring first this is the literal opposite of expanding logarithms in expanding we factored everything first and we use that to create these products well here when we're going backwards we're going to factor last and you need to simplify whatever our quotient is remember that that 5 because that's an exponent it needs to be an exponent on the entire expression so x minus 1 all to the fifth power now what we're going to do is we're going to look at whether we're adding subtracting since we're subtracting here we're going to create one logarithm with a quotient so i'm going to get to this when we get to that example and the one after that every positive logarithm or logarithm being added is going to create a factor on the numerator for you every logarithm that's being subtracted or negative is going to create a factor on the denominator for you you should do this all in one step don't do like five different steps do it all at once positive logarithm that factor goes in the numerator minus or negative logarithm same base that factor goes on the denominator and now now we have to simplify so now is the time where we factor and see if anything cancels out so x squared minus 1 factors is x minus 1 and x plus one well that's something that we can simplify since we have an x plus one x minus one over x plus one to the fifth power this factor and one of those factors actually do simplify so we end up getting log base four of x minus one over x plus one to the fourth a lot of students get here and they leave it because they forget to check that the reason why i'm showing this problem to you is so that you do check your simplification it's the literal opposite of your expansion and so when you get down to the end you gotta factor and check to see if you can simplify it can happen a lot when we're combining some logarithms so we're taking a look we're saying exponents first submerge this coefficient at exponents every positive logarithm creates a factor on the numerator or added logarithm creates a factor on the numerator every negative logarithm creates a factor that's not every subtracted logarithm creates a factor on the denominator just put it all together and since we've dealt with exponents first we don't have to do anything else besides simplify at that point okay moving right along so we got another one we're going to combine this first thing we do is we look for any exponents or any coefficients that move as exponents and we don't have any well that's okay what we're going to do now is notice that because these all have the same base of b they're all natural logarithms we can combine this with products and quotients in one logarithm one ln not three different ones we're trying to get one and so we're going to create one quotient every logarithm that's added or positive is going to create a factor of the numerator every logarithm that's negative or subtract it creates a factor on the denominator so we just got to look at this and say because they're all the same base because we're adding and we're subtracting we can connect by uh by multiplication and with division and so we're just going to notice where those things go so create one logarithm create a big fraction all of the factors of these two logarithms so ln of x over x minus one well that's positive that's going to create this as a factor on the numerator plus okay plus means i'm connecting by a product plus product this you create a factor on my numerator now it is a factor we are multiplying there minus okay when we subtract or we have a negative logarithm when we're combining via subtraction here we're creating a factor on the denominator whatever's being subtracted that creates a factor on your denominator just like the positive creative factor on your numerator so we're going to put this as a factor here man i hope that makes sense i hope that you're seeing that addition positive numerator subtraction negative denominator we're combining it one time we're just using these two properties at once to create this this quotient that has factors appropriately depending on whether we're adding or subtracting we're doing these properties but it's nice to do it one time so don't get confused with different steps where you go that's harder to do well now we had to simplify we didn't factor first we didn't have to but now after we've combined via products and quotients depending on whether we have addition subtraction we've got a factor we have to simplify so we're going to do that and writing that way also might help to help you to see that we can simplify sometimes so x on the numerator x on the denominator we're multiplying fractions here we could write one fraction that simplifies and that makes things a little bit nicer to see even now that is a complex fraction and how we simplify complex fractions is typically we multiply the main numerator this part and the main denominator this part by whatever the lcd is so in this case the lcd comes from whatever complex fraction is so we take a look at that that's x plus one over x minus one our lcd is x minus one if we multiply both the numerator and denominator by that lcd it's going to simplify the denominator for the complex fraction that's usually what happens there are other ways to do it i like this technique it works in my opinion the most concise but you can do it other ways so in this case we say all right we multiply by the lcd lcd always cancel out the denominator of our complex fractions it doesn't cancel out anything here this is all in the numerator the only denominator here is one the diameter here is where we got our our lcd from the x minus one this goes away so that's gonna cancel we're just gonna get x plus one over whatever this is i'm all right well when we don't cancel this this is going to end up giving us x minus 1 squared times x plus 1. and we're going to see one more thing so cancel here lcd does that with complex fractions x plus 1 we got it x minus 1 times x minus 1. this is not on a denominator this is multiplying right to it that's going to be x minus 1 squared and x plus one and then we see okay we have a factor over a factor everything's multiplied together it's all factored looks really good this is also going to simplify [Music] leaving us with 1 over x minus 1 squared and that's as simple as we can get so ln of 1 over x minus 1 squared wow that's a lot nicer to work with than that is for most of things that we're going to do especially if we have to solve anything with an equation because you're going to combine those anyway so we're really going opposite we're moving our exponents of coefficients of exponents first combining everything at once all of our subtraction addition creates corresponding factors in one logarithm of numerators for addition and positives and denominators for subtraction or negatives and then we factor and simplify that's actually the hardest part is okay so you're factoring then you're getting rid of the complex fraction and then you're simplifying more that can take the most work all right moving on just a little bit we got two more examples this next one just a little bit of work of simplification here that i want you to see also that when we have multiple things that are being added subtract and we can just group those together as products on numerators or products and denominators depending whether addition or subtraction so let's take a look at it first thing whenever we're combining let's move all of our coefficients as exponents first so that's going to be log base 3 of you can also choose to write these cube roots as exponents themselves that'll make it nicer if you have to move other exponents because you can multiply them a little bit nicer than you can with the actual radical so log base 3 great let's write that as x to the one third power so this is x to the one third power but when i take that 21 as an exponent now hopefully you see what i'm saying it's a little bit nicer to think of one-third times 21 than a cube root to the 21st power that's a little bit more awkward for some people log base 3 of 9 question could you change that could you simplify that right now and do 2 because log base 3 of 9 is 2. 2 to what power gives you 9. 2. could you do it yes and you could but you wouldn't be able to combine it with the rest of these logarithms so if our goal is to get one logarithm you don't want to simplify it if that's not our goal maybe you would in some cases but right now we're trying to combine this into one logarithm and so we're not going to simplify that i hope that makes sense we do need to move that 2. and this doesn't have any any exponent for us another thing that you could see hopefully you do see it could you just take log base 3 of 9 and log base 3 of 9 and subtract it yeah you could and sometimes books do this and we know we don't catch them we go wait a minute could you just get rid of that yeah you can but i want to show you what's going to happen because sometimes we can see this or miss it but later on we'll see that it simplifies i want to show you right now whether you subtract them here or whether you create one fraction and simplify them in the fraction it doesn't it doesn't matter now that would be quicker what i just talked about but i want you to see the point of putting this together in one one fraction and using division to simplify that way we we kind of validate that that's possible there so i want to see that so we've moved our coefficients as exponents we know that we could simplify this to do 2 and 2 here hey 3 to what power gives you 9 2 2 minus 2 is 0. great because you do log base 3 of 9 minus base 3 and 9 is 0. yes you could could you make this one fraction anyway if you missed it you get the same answer yeah there's lots of options as long as you follow the properties that i've given you you really can't get it wrong so we know that if we want to combine this into one logarithm it's going to be a log base 3. it's going to be a fraction because we have both positive and addition logarithms and subtraction or negative logarithms every one of the logarithms that's positive or being added creates a factor on the numerator so i'm going to have a factor of x to the 1 3 to the 21st power now could you right now simplify that and say 1 3 times 21 is 7 absolutely and that's exactly what we're going to do so this is x to the 7th power 1 3 times 1 21 is 7. times because we're adding addition creates products x to the 7th power times 9 addition creates products times x squared subtraction creates factors on the denominator quotients for us so minus log base 9 that creates over 9 and check out what happens whether you simplify here or create two and two and simplify there or nine divided by nine you need to be able to see that we are simplifying that that would create one if we further continue now we're just going to combine some some common bases by multiplication that means we're going to add those exponents log base 3 of x to the ninth power that's as simple as you can make it as combined as we can do i hope it makes sense i hope i'm really really making it make it sink into your head about how you connect some of these factors as products and quotients depending on whether they're added or subtracted terms we're going to come back with one more and make it as crazy as i can and then we'll go through it together all right so that's about as much as i could think of before i ran out of space on the board so let's go ahead and do that one if we're going to combine some logarithms and it's very important to do this in a lot of cases when we're solving equations you need to get one logarithm we're always going to move coefficients and make them into exponents of whatever our factors are inside of our logarithm so we're going to take a look at this move every single one of those coefficients not the signs just the numbers so that's 2 as an exponent 1 4 as an exponent of x minus 1. 2x plus 3 to the 3 8 power minus log of x to the one fifth power log of two to the fourth and then hey that doesn't have an exponent log of 12. now we are going to combine all this at one time because this is these are all logarithms of the same base and they're being joined together by addition and subtraction we're going to create one huge fraction and then we're going to go through and depending on whether we're adding or subtracting we're going to organize these factors in the appropriate numerator or denominator so positive says i'm going to put that factor on the numerator minus says i'm going to put that factor on the denominator plus says i'm going to put that factor on the numerator minus says i would put that factor on the denominator minus says i'm going to put that factor on the denominator and plus says i'm going to put that factor on the numerator could you do it differently yes but i've never seen a more concise way to do it when we understand that addition creates products these are all products subtraction creates quotients that's a quotient that's a quotient and that's a quotient if i were to expand this those are all on denominators there that's the easiest way i've ever i've ever seen how to do it or created how to do it now what we're going to do is if you have to have you can write these as radicals so i'm going to show that to you there's not much to simplify except for this right here you should expand that and say that that is 16. 12 over 16 we can simplify so i'm going to write this 12 first change that into 16 and organize a little bit better and also write these as radicals so 12 we got it 16 is here i'm gonna have x plus one to the second and i'm going to write this as an eighth root of 2x plus 3 all to the third power if this is in parenthesis that has to be in parenthesis two if you have a power that's greater than one so we have three we gotta have eighth root that's power here root here so eighth root of two x plus three to the third power our numerator looks pretty good we're going to simplify this in a moment all the things i'm going to do since i took that as 16 here i typically write single term factors before any multiple term factors so that's a fifth root of x then a fourth root of x minus one we don't need parentheses here and the only reason why we don't is because that's a power one that's a radical four and a power one so fourth root of x minus one to the first you don't need parentheses we're going to simplify the 12 and the 16. 4 goes into 12 three times and 16 four times but nothing else really simplifies there are ways that you could combine these radicals but it becomes pretty cumbersome and it's not going to be generally any better for you you can do it if you have to you have to but i'm going to leave it this way all right that's about as good as i can see how to combine that i hope that that makes sense and we're going to see this in just a couple videos when we start solving logarithms without common actually with n without common bases we do we do this in both cases and also in calculus we see it from time to time so i hope that you enjoy the videos i will see in a little bit for change your base then we get into solving you
