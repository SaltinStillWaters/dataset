Transcript for: Multiplicity and End Behavior of Polynomials (Precalculus - College Algebra 29)
hey welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about some features of polynomials as far as what they do graphically these are super important and they're also super cool uh what they do is they allow you to picture what the polynomial is going to do sketch it and get a fairly accurate picture with minimal work what we're going to talk about is multiplicity so what in the world that means and what end behavior does and turning points a little bit and that's at the very very end so we're going to talk about multiplicity first what exactly that means in relation to the roots or zeros or real zeros or x-intercepts that you're going to get from a polynomial after you have factored it after you've found some sort of x-intercept in that in that function so we'll talk about exactly what that does how it relates to a graph of that polynomial and then what the end behavior does as far as when you graph them we're not going to be graphing today but we're getting a very fairly clear picture what's going to happen when we get there so let's talk about multiplicity first what in the world that means what multiplicity refers to is a repeated zero or root or x-intercept in a polynomial or any function really uh that you're that you're talking about so what that means is if you can factor a polynomial which i've given you one that's factored and you have the exponent that exponent is going to determine the multiplicity of that particular zero or how many times that zero is repeated and i'll talk about that in just a little bit what it's going to do for you because again i don't like suspense so at least not what i'm teaching so here's what multiplicity is going to do multiplicity is going to say hey take all of these factors that you have set them equal to zero because we know that we can find x-intercepts for any function we set it equal to zero and look at the exponent that exponent will determine multiplicity and will tell you one of two things whether that zero that you get from every one of these factors that has a variable don't worry about the seven doesn't really matter as far as your x intercepts take every factor that has a zero or has a variable set equal to zero what that zero is going to do it's going to either bounce or touch the x-axis or it's going to cross it depending on what your multiplicity is whether it's even 2 4 or odd 1 5 you can say right now that this zero is going to create a bounce or a touch on the x axis so is this one that's a cross that's a cross why i'm about to explain that to you but that's what's going to happen so let's go ahead let's walk the process let's find multiplicity let's talk about the zeros talk about what a repeated group is why it's called multiplicity multiple roots talk about what those exponents do and they get a sort of a picture of it down here so if we ever want to find x-intercepts of a function including polynomials like what this one is based on this is just a factored version of a polynomial if we were if we wanted to do that if we want to find x-intercepts we set that function equal to zero so when we do that if you were just let's excuse the notation here just put that equal to zero and say that function is now equal to zero then in order to find x-intercepts from a factored version of a polynomial we set every factor that has a variable in it equal to zero and that's called the zero product property if we know that several things are multiplied together and that equals zero then each of those factors can set equal to zero will maintain that that's that statement so saying yeah if x equals zero it makes us true if x equals two it makes it true if x equals negative one-half it makes it true if x equals negative three it makes us true that's the zero product property kind of in a nutshell and we're doing the exact same thing fortunately we have all this factored uh well what if it wasn't factored i'm going to teach you that in the next section i'm going to teach you how to get to this point from a let's see degree 12 polynomial because there's no general way to factor that without knowing zeros so we'd have to have that in the first place so let's go ahead and let's use the zero product property there's a couple things i would like you to do when you're going through this process number one for every factor that has a variable make sure it's in parentheses this looks great this looks great this looks great but in order to not get confused on our multiplicity what i'm going to do i'm going to build parentheses right around that x because that x itself is a factor that we're going to set equal to zero i don't want you to get confused with the seven i don't want you to get confused with that power two as far as being a root itself x is going to be a zero the seven has absolutely nothing to do with that i know that's a little bit confusing so what's what's a seven do the seven determines the um kind of a factor that lets you make it more dramatic like like remember when we had if we just had x to the second power we'd say all right we know what that is that's a parabola if i put a 7 in front of it what's that do the parabola makes it very narrow it does not shift it it doesn't shift the the the vertex of that parabola that's still at the origin but what it does is it narrows it but if i put a negative 7 well that narrows it and reflects it it doesn't change the vertex at all it doesn't change the x-intercept at all and so this this coefficient coefficient of leading term really this coefficient of leading term has nothing to do with the x-intercepts themselves has to do with more with the shape of the graph and whether or not we are reflecting it now it will affect how we interact with the x-intercepts whether we cross it one way or another but that comes a little bit later when we start graphing so long story made short factor your polynomial we got it make sure that you have parentheses around every factor that has a variable in it like this one this one this one and now that one that's great and now we're going to set all those factors at variables equal to zero by the zero product property so we're all right well what what do we have then we have x equals zero and x minus two and x plus one half and x plus three equal to zero well that's a zero product property now we solve them all we all right that's that's pretty easy to solve this one's already solved so just x equals zero i'm going to write it again just because i want all of them to be here for us and if we add 2 we get x equals 2 and x equals negative 1 half if we subtract 1 half and x equals negative 3 if we subtract 3. so let's see 0 got it add 2 got it subtract 1 half subtract 3. these are all of the x intercepts that we can possibly have on that polynomial there's only four x intercepts now now wait a minute i just told you a little while ago that's a degree 12 and i'm going to get to that once we finish this example like how i determine the degree 12. it's that sort of fake distribution that i showed you i'm going to show you how to find the leading term in just a little bit but these are all the x-intercepts so why aren't there 12 of them well because we run into a repeated zero what's a repeated zero a repeated zero or a repeated root repeated x-intercept is when your factor has a power that's more than one so for instance what you could do with this it would be super awkward but what you could do with this instead of writing the seven x squared and then x minus two and then x plus one half to the fourth power you could do something a little crazy you could write this as seven times x times x that's the same thing as seven x squared times x minus two and this is where it gets a little crazy times x plus one half times x plus one half times x plus one half and you could do that again x plus one half i'm gonna pause there for just a second because hopefully you're gonna get the point right now we could do that this is still seven x squared times x minus two times x plus one half to the one two three fourth power here's the point of multiplicity or repeated word roots could you set x equal to zero and x equals zero yes are you gonna get two different roots no are you gonna do the same root twice yes and that twice you get in the same root twice that's what multiplicity means it's a repeated zero it's you're getting the same thing twice and that determines what happens with your graph that's really cool it's so valuable when we get into polynomials and we get into graphing rationals is knowing how many times that root is repeated will dictate whether we bounce or touch the x-axis or whether we cross the x-axis just based on the number of times that zero is repeated i'm going to tell you why when we get down to here so you could set this equal to zero uh let's see x plus one half equal to zero x plus one half equals zero x plus one half equals zero x plus one half equals zero but you're gonna get x equals negative one half four times that zero is repeated four times that has multiplicity four that's going to tell you that we're bouncing off the x-axis at x equals negative one-half that's awesome that's very important for us to know this you could do five times i'm going to write it because it's really annoying but you could write x plus 3 times x plus 3 5 times you would get x equals negative 3 5 times do you actually need to do that in order to understand you'd be getting the same root five times no you just need to know what exponents mean exponent means a repeated factor so we have a repeated factor repeated twice we have a non-repeated factor it's only done it's only repeated but it's actually not repeat at all you just have to have that same factor once we have a repeated factor four times a repeated factor five times that is what multiplicity means so frankly you do the zero product property without worrying about the exponents you get your zeros or x-intercepts or well real zeros or x-intercepts or your roots and you look at the exponent from where you got your zero you look at the exponent that is of on the factor from where you got your zero and that is your multiplicity that's how many times your root is repeated so what we would say here is that x equals zero has a multiplicity of two and x equals negative 2 has a multiplicity give it an exponent make sure all of your factors have an exponent they all will this has a multiplicity one x plus one half has a power four what that means is that this zero this x equals negative one half has been repeated four times that's a multiplicity four and lastly x plus 3 has a power of 5 that means that this 0 would repeat be repeated or this x intercept is repeated 5 times you get 5 of them if you were all that out and set them equal to 0 eat the same 0 5 times that's all multiplicity means how we use it is very powerful but that's all that it needs this is multiplicity 5. so if i can recap real quick which i'm going to because i'm making a video here's what multiplicity means and now what it does multiplicity means take a polynomial and factor it from those factors if you set the function equal to zero to find x-intercepts from those factors you will get zeros or x-intercepts or or roots if we do that use the zero product property and then solve them these are the only four real zeros or real roots or real x intercepts that we get the number of times they're repeated comes from the exponent above each factor from where you got your zeros that's how many times the zero would be repeated and that right there is called multiplicity now here's what it does depending on whether your multiplicity of your zero is even or odd it will tell you whether you bounce or sometimes we call that touch the x-axis or whether you actually cross it so it's not about the value of the x-intercept itself it's about how many times that x-intercept is repeated multiplicity means multiple times of repetition so we look at this and go all right this 0 is repeated twice it has a multiplicity 2. that is an even multiplicity i don't super care that it's too uh i care that it's even or odd i care whether the multiplicity is even or odd this two this x equals two this is not repeated you only see it one time that fact only appears once that is a multiplicity one we'd say that's odd multiplicity right there that shows you i'm not talking about the evenness or oddness here that's that's not the thing the thing is how many times we've been repeated that's multiplicity and whether that number is even or odd and i'll explain why it does this after i finish x equals negative one half that's a repeated root four times that's multiplicity four we really need to understand that that is an even number of repetitions of that zero even multiplicity and lastly multiplicity five says that factor's been repeated five times that zero would come up five times if we went ahead and worked all that out and set each factor equal to zero that multiplicity five that's great what i care about is that multiplicity is odd and here's the whole interpretation for us and why it works if you have a zero with an even multiplicity and all zeros all roots all x-intercepts if they're real numbers which you can't get there without complex numbers if you're just factoring normally so if we're if we're getting real zeros real x-intercepts all of them are going to intersect the x-axis so i call them x-intercepts in the first place they all intersect the x-axis every one of these every one of those numbers you're going to have your graph in some way interacting with the x-axis at x equals zero and x equals two and x equals negative one half and x equals negative three this graph will be there on the x axis however how it intersects er sorry how it interacts intersects depends on what your multiplicity is if your multiplicity for that zero is even then this graph is going to we call it either touch or bounce off the x-axis it's going to go down and go boop or come up and go boop and bounce right off of it it will not cross in other words it looks something like this either your graph is going to come down touch or come up and touch but it will not cross now i'm going to answer the question why why does it do that why does that even make it bounce and not cross i want you to think on sort of a microscopic level for just a second and we call doing that like a neighborhood so you live in a neighborhood probably uh where you have some some neighbors around you some like some like points around you but it's not talking globally all right so when you say neighborhood you're sort of zoomed in to like where you live so we're zoomed in to where these x-intercepts right here live and around that neighborhood what you would have if you say hey if we have an even multiplicity what happens when you have an even multiplicity that's like a power 2 or a power 4 or power 6. what happens when you take numbers to the second power or the fourth power or the sixth power well they're all positive what that means is that on both sides of that x-intercept that has an even multiplicity so around x equals zero let's imagine like this is zero for second around x equals zero then you would square that the numbers what's going to happen well they'd both be positive yes but i want you to think more importantly they'd both be the same sign so what they'd either both be positive or if i reflected it both be negative they'd have to have the same sign around the neighborhood of that x-intercept so for evenness for even multiplicity around these zeros x equals zero and around x equals negative one-half if i take something a little bit to the left of that just a little bit over here little neighborhood or a little bit over here little neighborhood and i plug that in and then i say okay take that value subtract one half and then square it around that neighborhood you're going to get the same value of an output um either both at least a sign both positive or both negative it's not quite symmetry so i hope you're hearing this it's not exact symmetry around that but it will at least have the same sign either both positive or if i put a negative in front of this both negative and it sort of depends when we get a little bit further on whether you're bouncing coming up and going down or bouncing coming down and coming up i'm going to explain that to you in another video but the main point here is that in a neighborhood around the x-intercept if you have an even multiplicity another route that's been repeated two times four times six times etcetera then what's happening is that your neighborhood around the x-intercept has to have the same sign both above or both below the x-axis i hope that makes sense to you i hope you're kind of getting that that hey even multiplicity is going to bounce or touch gonna look like this around that x-intercept and the reason why is because the neighborhood around that you have to have the same sign as far as odd goes if you have a zero or a root with odd multiplicity you're going to cross the x-axis at that point so you'd look something like this or that either coming down and crossing or coming up and crossing the x-axis why well because we know that with with odds once we get a different sign so if i pick a number let's say this and do this again let's pick how about just two here's x equals two now look look at where that two came from that two came from x minus two imagine picking a number in the neighborhood that means very very close that doesn't mean three that doesn't mean five that means like 2.0001 a neighborhood is really tight knit compared to the world your neighborhood is super small okay so if i pick something in a neighborhood of 2 like 2.01 or 2.0001 2.00001 so something right close to 2 but just bigger than it what's going to happen well something just bigger than 2 minus 2 is going to be a positive number if i if i take a positive number to a an odd power like 1 or 5 or 7 3 1 3 5 7 any of those odds it's going to maintain that sign of being positive i'm going to say that one more time you really need to get this so if i take a number that's slightly bigger than 2 and i subtract 2 from it i'm going to get a positive value and i take it to an odd exponent it's going to maintain that positivity for me i get a positive that's above the x-axis now take something in the neighborhood just smaller than 2 like 1.99 okay take 1.99 and subtract 2. but wait a minute that's negative yes it is now a negative to an odd power what's that do well that maintains negativity negatives to even powers don't negatives even powers maintain the same sign as if you were positive it doesn't really matter because we know that even powers maintain sign for both positives and negatives odd powers switch sign and that's why we cross for odds and that's why we bounce for evens because in that neighborhood if i had an even whether i'm above or below the number i get a positive or negative yes but when i square it or take to the fourth power or six power gives me the same sign when i have an odd if i'm above or below in that neighborhood it's going to give me a positive or negative yes but odds maintain the sign of that so for positives things bigger than that i get a positive and for negatives taking it to an odd power i get a negative that's above and below or below and above the x-axis it's going to cross it here that's above and above or below than below because it maintains the same sign i hope that makes sense maybe watch that again to get the point of in the neighborhood around your zero you'll be positive excuse me positive or negative but the way that your exponent interacts will either keep the sign the same or reflect it keep the sign the same or change the sign if you're odd even to keep it the same that's why they're sort of quasi-symmetrical around that that's why they maintain the same sign they're just going to bounce but odds don't switch sign that's therefore we cross so i hope that makes sense that's what multiplicity does for you and we're going to now we're going to use that the last thing i wanted to tell you before we get into end behavior maybe after we get into end behavior i'm going to show you how to fake distribute that to recap that so we'll get there in just a minute all right so now it's time to move on to end behavior these two things if you haven't realized it yet these two things are going to be super important for our graphing we just learned a minute ago that multiplicity what it does is basically tells us if you can find your x-intercepts which we're going to be able to do after the next section we're going to be able to factor it as much as possible over linears or irreducible quadratics we're going to be able to do that we're going to be able to use the zero product property to be able to count exponents and say hey this is a double root or a single root or a quadruple root or a clint double root or basically multiplicity two one four and five and determine from that whether they have even or oddness we talked already about how evenness maintains sign in the neighborhood around your x-intercept and therefore you'll bounce maintain sign either for positive negatives you get the same sign out bounce or for odds you cross different signs different outputs that are the opposite sign outputs that's going to tell us whether we're going to bounce across around the x-intercept that's very valuable for graphing we need to know that the second thing we're going to learn today is about end behavior what end behavior does it says because these polynomials are all continuous we'll talk about that in last they're all continuous there's no gaps there's no jumps there's no holes asymptotes there's no cusps there are these really smooth flowing curves that that go to and from infinity somehow all along the x-axis and once you start restricting domain which we're not we already learned that domain of polynomial functions is all real numbers look at anything there's no room for a domain issue well what that means is that our end behavior is going to be one of four cases our four cases are you can start from negative infinity on the on the y i'm talking outputs here negative infinity and go to positive you can start at negative and go back to negative start from positive and go to negative or start from positive and end with positive think about the cubic function x cubed looks like this and the quadratic function x squared looks like this that's positive to positive or negative to positive you're going to get one of these four shapes on any i look like i'm dancing now uh you're going to get positive to positive negative negative negative to positive or positive to negative as far as our infinities are concerned that's the only four things we ever get out of polynomials and it all comes from the leading term of your polynomial i told you in the last video it was important this is where the rubber meets the road for the leading term so if we look at our polynomials the leading term all that means if you need a little refresher is that if you put this in order it's the first term that you see it should be the term the highest exponent that's your leading term so in our case our leading term is 3x to the fifth here our leading term is not negative 2x to the third because that's out of order so if we took just a moment to write this in order our leading term would be negative 5x to the fourth here's the point within a finite interval of the x-axis your function can do a lot of really cool things but outside of that it's going to behave as far as your leading term dictates your end behavior is determined by your leading terms so if we think about like way out there on the x-axis it's going to be determined by this so this is going to look and behavior-wise a lot like i'm going to use squigglies to say approximately so like the end behavior is going to look approximately like 3x to the fifth at least that's what it's going to look like when we get out to the infinities x approaches negative infinity and x approaches positive and we're going to see what that looks like and for g of x it will look approximately not modeled exactly but approximately like negative 5x to the fourth so all we need to understand is what those power functions look like you remember that last video so the power functions are basically looking at your leading term and saying hey what's what's that going to be well that's an odd well what do odd functions look like well around the origin they're symmetrical about the origin and around the y-intercept our y-axis evens our symmetrical about the y-axis so here's what this would look like this says this is a positive a three's positive odd type of a function odds look like this when they're positive so why am i leaving the middle not filled in because this is end behavior only what's going to happen is that this function is going to start by coming up increasing it might do some sort of turning points things like that and then it's going to end increasing that's the point when you put this in conjunction with what you're doing around your x-intercepts it's extremely powerful with these two things multiplicity and end behavior if you add just two more to them any y intercepts that you have and any turning points you can identify you have a very very powerful graph turning points are really identified like a calc one class where you take derivative set equal to zero and you go oh that's probably a turning point let's just do a sign analysis test and it's not that hard um here we're not there yet because you don't know what a derivative is yet but you will and keep this in mind when you get there that if you know multiplicity oh my gosh students usually forget it and then i have to refresh it or they never ever really put it together use that and end behavior and you have a very powerful graph so for our our leading term you go yeah that's a leading term that gives me end behavior i know it's odd odds look like this or if i have a negative they look like this for evens go well evens this is a our leading term negative 5x to the fourth i know even functions look like this or if they have a negative they look like this why well because even power functions have to be symmetric about the y-axis why is that because if i take positives and negatives and i take them to the fourth power or second power or sixth power it's giving me the same sign out if i reflect it it's still the same sign but negative that's the same exact logic that we use with multiplicity that's why i paired these things together because they have very similar concepts odds don't work like that i'd say if i take positives and negatives and take them to an odd power i get out a positive and a negative respectively or if i reflect it a negative and a positive reflective respectively it's going to reflect but they're going to be opposite signs so odd opposite odd opposite that means cross even the same even the same that means bounce same exact idea that we're using but now it's on a grand scheme it's saying hey look at your your leading term let that be a power function for you and then determine that is a negative even even means the same but negative means downward opening so this would look about like that now some some interesting things might happen in the middle of this we might get some x-intercepts that be determined by this we might get some um some turning points that are not associated with the x-axis and we'd have to identify those typically with calculus or estimate them but that's about it so one more thing what if we change some signs what would it do if we change this to let's say negative 3x to the fifth then what that would say is you're an odd you have opposite signs but now i'm reflecting it so now it would sort of do that i'm trying to color code coordinate for you so that the opposite there would reflect your graph totally reflected actually here if we change this to a plus then instead of downward we sort of get a upward opening at least as far as the end behavior is concerned that would be an even sure but positive means you'd come from positive infinity and at positive infinity or at least heading that way that's what end behavior does for you uh the last thing that i want to talk about is is this i mentioned turning points a couple times what a turning point is in a graph is where you have a local that means in a little neighborhood a local maximum or a local minimum so where you take your graph and you are increasing then change to decreasing local max or decreasing then change to increasing local men they're they're basically like a little peak or a little valley somewhere in your graph if your polynomial has degree whatever in this case degree 5 there it is or in this case degree 4 there it is that's always from your leading term then you will have one well at most one less turning point than your degree what that means is that if your degree is five you can change directions at most four times so if you're a degree five and you know that you go from here to here let's say you're a positive degree five uh well how many times can you change direction and still make that work well you can do one change one two three four but you can't do a five because you'd end at the wrong infinity so to make this work you can have at most four changes to make you still end up with the end behavior that you need for degree five polynomial even if you reflect it still the most four changes you can do without messing up your end behavior or likewise imagine a power four or degree four a degree four polynomial should either end this way or this way it's even it has to it's based on that sort of symmetry idea at least from our power function that's why we have approximately it's not exactly symmetrical but it's based on that so if you have to end this way so degree four you can have at most three turning points that would be down then up that's one up then down that's two down then up that's three what if you did a fourth well you'd be facing the wrong way you'd be an odd so you have to have at most uh one less than the degree number of turning points does it have to be that many no it doesn't it really depends on what's happening in your function but it doesn't have to be that many turning points it's just at most that many the last one i've said it already but every polynomial because of its its domain being all real numbers there's no room for any sort of asymptotes it's like a kind of a force field that you can't hit it makes it a sort of weird gap in your function or a hole or a cusp but cusp is just a sharp point be like going like this and then a sharp point there's no room for that in polynomials they're not that interesting so every polynomial creates a continuous this is continuous curve with no cusps no sharp points that means they are continuous everywhere and also later on in calculus they're differentiable everywhere means you can find a derivative or a slope of a curve at a point so the tangent line to a curve at a point everywhere basically they're the the uh the least interesting graph that we have because there's there's nothing weird about them and that that's pretty much it that's what i need you to know about polynomials at this point next time we'll focus on starting to find functions from zeros and then after that we're going to graph them so it's it's pretty cool but hopefully you can see how important this is to graphing man if you can factor and you know your zeros your x-intercepts from your zero product property and you can find repeatedness multiplicity of your roots you know whether you're going to bounce cross bounce or cross that's very important i explained to you why if you know your end behavior so basically just your leading term you know whether you're going to end this way this way this way or this way just by reading whether you're odd that means opposite associate odd with opposite uh positive or negative or even positive or negative that's it the last thing that i wanted to talk to you about i mentioned it i said after we finished end behavior in this multiplicity i would show you again how to fake distribute because the multiplicity here is very easy but your end behavior might be eluding you you go i i'm not i don't remember how to do that with your end behavior um what we can do is sort of fake distribute this distributing this would take a very very very long time you'd have x plus three five times you'd have to foil it because five times a lot of inside outsides and distribute so instead of doing that use the same concept that we had that there are one two three four five factors here one of which is a a sort of a constant factor and then what we're going to do is multiply them together as far as the largest powers that you would get from distribution so we take our 7 times x to whatever power is here your multiplicity x squared times x to whatever power's here x to the first times x to whatever power is here x to the fourth x to whatever power's here x to the fifth that i guarantee you will be your leading term if you took the time to distribute all this don't forget the seven it's pretty important because you know that that seven was negative it would reverse your end behavior so keep that that's seven and then we know that if we're multiplying x's we're going to add those exponents that's 5 9 10 11 12. that's 7 x to the 12th ah so right now what's the end behavior you should picture in your head what the end behavior is is the end behavior odd well no is it even negative no because a 7 is positive this end behavior will look like this guaranteed that is so powerful when you have it in conjunction with your multiplicity all of which has to work together you get a very clear graph with almost no work now finding the factors yeah that's a lot of work we do with that in a couple videos but at least we have that so again if i change the sign made that negative that would now be an even so same sign but but uh reflected so downward opening man i hope that's made sense to you oh yeah one more thing if this had been an irreducible quadratic if that had been an irreducible quadratic like x to the second power plus three don't forget that you would have to multiply these so you'd have two times five that would give you ten here not seven you would multiply that and the reason being you have x squared plus three times x squared plus three times x squared plus three five times so if you were to distribute that you get x to the tenth and then here you see all nine see seventeen yeah 7x to the 17th that would be an odd if it's positive this way or if i put that negative back that would be an odd reflected okay now i hope that makes sense so you talked about multiplicity we talked about end behavior we've done an example of that fake distribution to get the leading term where we get end behavior from and next time we'll start wrapping all this together so i hope you enjoyed it and i'll see you for another video you
