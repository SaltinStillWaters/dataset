Transcript for: How to Solve Basic Inverse Trigonometric Functions (Precalculus - Trigonometry 20)
welcome to another video this video is going to be pretty quick i'm going to talk about how to solve some very basic inverse trig functions um the reason why is just get your brains ready for how to solve these things and understand that while an inverse undoes a function a function will also undo an inverse so here's the idea very basic very straightforward just getting us ready to solve some of these equations coming up in just a while if ever you want to solve an equation isolate the variable in order to isolate the variable sometimes we can factor to do that and create these factors but with functions like this we want to isolate the thing that contains the variables so if you have an inverse trig function somewhere in your equation you need to isolate it so what we're going to do is say if we can isolate the inverse trig function then we'll take the appropriate function undo it so for sine inverse we'll use sine for cosine inverse use cosine for tangent inverse we use tangent on both sides there's not a whole lot of domain work to deal with because this x will naturally fit in whatever domain you need it to so we don't have to deal with a lot of that it's going to work out just fine for us you're going to see that as we go through so let's get started if we have 4 sine inverse of x equals pi the first thing we want to do is of course isolate sine inverse of x so that we can undo it with the sine function that means we'll divide by 4. now we've isolated sine inverse of x the only way that we can get x by itself is use sine on both sides of this equation and that's exactly what we're going to do sine is going to undo sine inverse just like sine inverse undid sine they're inverses of one another so we have to show that on the left hand side of both of these sides of this equation so sine of sine inverse of x that's just going to be x on the right hand side wait a minute sine of pi over 4 that's something we can actually do so sine of pi over 4 is square root of 2 over 2. use your circle if you remembered it already that's great and we're done we just solved that in fact if you plug that in this would actually work sine inverse of square root of 2 over 2 is pi over 4. four times pi over four well four should cancel you get pi pi equals pi it is true it does work so isolate the inverse function then take the appropriate function on both sides same thing is going to happen here 3 times tan inverse of x equals pi let's divide both sides by 3 isolating that tan inverse it's inverses the undo functions so for the inverse of tangent sorry for tangent inverse tangent is that appropriate inverse let's take tangent on both sides on the left hand side tangent of tangent inverse of x is just going to give us x on the right hand side tangent of pi over 3 well tangent of pi over 3 is going to take square root of 3 over 2 divided by 1 half that's simply the square root of 3. now i'm going faster that because we spent a lot of time doing things like that using the unit circle so we should know that tan of pi over 3 takes the y coordinate over the x coordinate square root of three over two divided by one half is square root of three let's move on so three cosine inverse of two x equals 2 pi looks a little bit more difficult but remember the idea isolate the function that contains your variable then use an inverse function so we're simply going to divide by 3 here once we've done that cosine inverse of 2x equals 2 pi over 3. well we've got to get at that 2x but we get it we have to undo that function hanging around it we can't divide and multiply we've got to use cosine on both sides on the left hand side cosine of cosine inverse of 2x is just 2x on the right hand side cosine of 2 pi over 3 well that's going to be negative one-half so it's in quadrant two x is negative cosine therefore is negative negative one half dividing both sides by two now now we've isolated that 2x that's great cosine inverse is gone we just get x equals negative one fourth last one looks a little bit tricky because because y we have we have two terms that have cosine inverse of x in them just like every other time that you have like terms on different sides of your equation you can bring them on one side and combine them and you can actually combine this if this is four cosine inverse of x and 2 cosine inverse of x let's subtract 2 cosine inverse of x on both sides and add 2 pi this should look familiar getting all of our x terms on one side and everything else on the other side this is isolating that variable so we've subtracted 2 cosine inverse of x on both sides we've added 2 pi to both sides these are actually combinable so if we have 4 of something minus 2 of something altogether you have 2 cosine inverse of x then we're going to divide both sides by two so two pi divided by two is just pi lastly now that we've i isolated that inverse function we need to use cosine the appropriate function is going to get rid of cosine inverse on both sides of our equation because cosine of cosine inverse simplify that's literally one of our identities there for inverse functions we're going to get x on the right hand side cosine of pi is negative one so cosine of 180 degrees or pi that's going to be negative one comma zero the x coordinate is negative one we know that's negative one and we're done so i hope that that makes sense it's honestly really really quick isolate your inverse function and take the appropriate honestly parent function that root function on both sides your functions undo inverses just like inverses under functions not a whole lot with domain that we have to mess with here which is very very nice i hope it makes sense and i'll see you for another video
