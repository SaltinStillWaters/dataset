Transcript for: Power Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 28)
hey again welcome to another video in this video we are going to talk about something called power functions i'll tell you what that means in a minute but i want to tell you why we're learning it we are learning about power functions for one reason to get a picture of the end behavior of a polynomial here's what's going to happen when you have a polynomial and you have found your leading term the end behavior of your polynomial is going to follow that leading term and that leading term is a power function so what a power function means it's just a polynomial with one term so the whole concept of what we're going to be doing remember i was teaching where we're going the whole concept what we're doing is look at your polynomial look at your leading term find the degree check out the leading coefficient that's a single term you're looking at that power function one term is going to tell you the end behavior of your polynomial so that's why we're talking about power functions is you get a picture of the end behavior so that's why i want that's what i want you to be thinking of is the polynomial going to be looking like this like this like this or like this at the end of it at the ends because that's the only four cases that you can possibly have for polynomials so we're going to talk about that but that's the concept so with that in mind thinking about that let's go through and talk about power functions so what a power function is it's just this polynomial with a single term like i said we're going to be looking at the leading term as our power function so what that means is that they're pretty easy to graph and they're very very predictable so in order to get a kind of a view of what power functions do what they look like let's look at a few very simple power functions from here we're going to draw some conclusions about what if your n is even what if your n is odd because they're all going to be this way we'll talk about just a picture in our head of what these four would look like and then how to go and use transformations which you've already done i'm not spending a whole lot of time on that one so our power functions are very predictable and they follow one of two patterns whether they are even or whether they are odd they're going to follow one of those two patterns an even function is symmetrical about the y-axis and odd function is symmetrical about the origin that's the only two things we can possibly have with a power function so and why why because if we have anything else there'd be something added or subtracted to it or within it to shift it around and doing that would create more terms even if i had parentheses here with something inside i could distribute right and that would give me more terms so because power functions have only one term there's no shifting there's no way to not be symmetrical about either the origin or the the y-axis i had those backwards by the way the origin of the y-axis if you have power functions so very nice very predictable let's take a look at it what we're going to do here is just plug in negative 1 0 and 1 and get a pattern we're going to take the pattern and talk about even and odd power functions so if i take f of x equals x and i plug in negative one i'm going to get negative one zero zero and one i'm gonna get one so we'd have this nice function that would have those three points let's go over to x squared now i'm going to draw the the curves in just a minute because i want you to follow the pattern let's go over to x squared i'm going to plug in negative 1 and get positive 1. 0 get 0 1 and get 1. so i have these three points and again we're going to draw the curve in just a bit let's go down to x cubed if i take x to the third power and i plug in negative 1 0 and 1. negative 1 to the third power is negative 1 again 0 i'm going to get 0 1 i'm going to get positive 1. look at exactly the same points as f of x equals x the exact same what we call key points key points if you remember from lots of videos ago are a great way to graph with transformations because it lets you move the graph around and still have three points to graph with as long as you understand the shape these are the same and in fact when we get to odds every odd function at power function ever is going to have these three key points negative 1 negative 1 0 0 and 1 1 every single one of them will have those three key points now let's look at x to the fourth x to the fourth power if i plug in negative one if i evaluate that negative one to the fourth power is positive one zero gives you zero and 1 gives you 1. these are the exact same three points we got an x squared and in fact every even power function ever is going to have those same three key points negative one positive one zero zero and one one so really all that differentiates between our odd and our even is this side of your graph this is what dictates whether you're going to be symmetrical about the origin be able to rotate that 180 degrees or about the y-axis be able to fold it over and have a mirror image it's just that that exponent so if we had this is where the the phrase even or odd really comes from it's from power functions if we have an odd exponent you are going to have an odd type of symmetry about the origin if you have an even exponent and your power function you're going to have even symmetry about the y-axis that's true all the time for power functions so wait a minute if we always have the same same three points and all of them go through the origins you notice that they have to because they can't be shifted around there's no adding there's no subtracting there's no other terms just one they all go through the origin they all have the point one one odds have negative one negative one evens have negative one positive one and that dictates your symmetry they're very predictable so what is the difference between these two graphs and these two graphs the difference is the the radicalness of your your graph itself and here's what i'm going to say as your exponent gets higher these graphs get more dynamic more dramatic so f of x equals x to the first power man that's just a straight line that's a constant slope do you remember that slope here would be one up one over one up one over and up one over every time that's a constant slope so that's just our normal diagonal straight line that would create a 45 degree angle between x-axis and the line itself that that's it but as we start increasing our exponent we start curving it so we start going and then x to the fifth would be even more dramatic and actually the seventh even more dramatic to the point where it would look almost like a box like this sort of boxy in nature so x to the third is going to be a lot more curved in its nature if we had x to the fifth maybe i can superimpose that here real quick for you x to the fifth would still go through the same three points but the way it would do it is much more dramatic so a very steep and then super shallow and then very steep again and the higher our exponent the more dramatic our graph is going to get so that's why i put this odd over here i'm not going to put any graph on here at all because if you have an odd exponent either one or three or five or seven or nine or so forth all of them are going to climb every single one of them is going to climb every single one of those is going to climb from negative infinity on the y-axis to positive infinity they're all going to look like this now if we have a coefficient that's negative yes we can switch them but they're all going to look like that every single odd ever is going to look like that that's kind of cool that's kind of predictable we have some key points there that we can use in our graph the idea is hey if you know that your leading term remember we're always going to lead in terms of always going to graphing here if our leading term is an odd degree we know that the end behavior our graph is going to look like that that's super cool we also know that it's like a fifth power it's gonna be very dramatic seventh power very dramatic third power not so much first power well we kind of know how to graph those already um so that would just be a straight diagonal line that's that's kind of easy but they're all going to have those key points now as far as even sort of the same thing happens we know that x to the second power has this really nice normal parabola we're very used to it x to the fourth is going to start getting more dynamic more dramatic it's going to be a little flatter here and steeper as we get past 1 and negative 1. so what happens with our degree remember the degree is the largest power we talked about last video what happens with our degree is that within 1 to negative 1 we're very very flat and the higher the degree the flatter we are outside of one to one very very steep and the the the larger the exponent the steeper that we are do you notice that the x to the fifth would be very steep until we get here and then it flattens out flat flat flat very very dynamic curve and then outside of that very very steep very interesting the same thing happens with x to the fourth if we would have something like x to the sixth x to the eighth it'd almost start looking like how like most of the rectangle would be almost straight down very very sharp curve almost flat very very sharp curve and so the higher exponent we get the more dynamic but all of our evens are going to fit this model where we go through negative 1 1 0 0 and 1 1. they're all going to look like this yes if we had a negative coefficient it would reflect it to remember that how a negative coefficient reflects a graph we can do that but this is the main point of of our power functions i want to go through it just just one time to make sure you get the main point the main point is when we get to graphing polynomials which we're almost there we're going to look at the leading term the leading term is one term therefore it's a power function it will either be even or odd i believe either have an even degree or an odd degree and that will tell you whether your function does this or does this if it has a negative in front of it well it can reflect it then this or that that's it we can also start graphing this with our key points which is pretty cool we can use that for transformations mostly but let's let's imagine something for a second let's imagine that these are our leading terms of four different polynomial driven functions and let's see if we can put a picture to it so here's what i want you to do if these are our leading terms i want you to think about f of x equals 2x and think in your head whether that is an even or an odd power function first remember that even oddness of functions has absolutely nothing to do with the coefficient has only to do with the exponent so the exponent here is one and you go wow that's an odd power function how is it going to look is it going to look like this is it going to look like this in just just the generalness well this is a odd so it's going to have to go through negative 1 1 0 0 and 1 1 it's going to have to climb so it's going to have to climb from negan infinity to positive infinity we'll talk about domain and range here after we cover this so here in our case that is going to be this sort of climbing function and now we think about it what's the what's the exponent so our exponents one it's not very dynamic in fact it's going to be a straight line so we picture that in our head this end behavior looks like this same slope so with 2 over 1 throughout it's just a straight line it's going to go from negative 5 to positive infinity on the y axis that's pretty cool how about the next one the next one is negative three x to the second power first thing we want to do understand that this should be the leading term of some larger polynomial or just finding end behavior how it looks at the tails that's what we want well that has a well what type of an exponent well it's a two that that's an even even functions have to look like this or this depending on the coefficient so we know that if i covered that negative 3 it would go through negative 1 1 0 0 and 1 1. so this is this almost parabola that is a parabola this almost parabola type of even and now we look at our coefficients well that's a negative what what do negatives do what's the three do remember the sum transformations um if you need to watch that video go back and watch transformations from a while back because that will tell you that hey that negative that reflects it that 3 makes it narrower but it doesn't take away the fact that that's an even and that means symmetry about the y so this is even yes reflected okay and more narrow that's telling you end behavior so this is a larger polynomial and this is the leading term the term the highest degree the term of the high sorry term the highest exponent giving you a degree of two that this would have an end behavior that is downward even and narrow that's what that would tell you how about this negative x to the third so we think let's see uh negative x to the third if that's going to be our leading term that's a power function it's got a degree of 3 so 3 is odd 3 has this idea of negative one one zero zero one one okay it's climbing how's it let's cover that that would be climbing how is it climbing uh well it's got this sort of curve in it it's not straight it does have a curve in it because of that power 3. now think about the negative that negative would take your here's my odd and now i'm going to reflect it so this this power function says i'm going to be dropping so this this curve downward and that's if this was a leading term of some larger polynomial we would understand the the end behavior of that saying yep i'm going to look about like that it's a power three so it's going to have this curve in it yeah a little bit more dynamic than a straight line it's negative that means it's reflected from this so we're dropping from positive into negative infinity last one how about x to the fourth if the seven x to the fourth can you picture it can you picture that this is symmetrical about the y-axis just like this was symmetrical about the origin it was okay we could reflect it's still symmetrical this is symmetric about the y-axis so it has to match up on both sides of the y-axis this is a positive seven so this is even looks like this positive seven okay it's not reflected and seven itself says i'm pretty narrow so the end behavior of this graph wherever it comes from looks really narrow like that it's going to be very dynamic i hope that makes sense i hope you can see here the the value and understanding what our power functions are because they're going to be coming from our leading terms our leading terms are going to give us this end behavior and that's really really nice to know as far as our domain because these come from polynomials and polynomials have a domain of all real numbers the domain for all of these is all real numbers there's not a number that you won't be able to plug in and get something out get a real number out so all of them are real numbers there are no negative exponents there's no rational exponents there's no logarithms therefore with these polynomials you can have all real numbers all the time now as far as our our range goes we've already talked about key points we know that as far as our range the range for an odd power function look at it every one of these graphs even if it had been negative and reflected it would go from negative infinity to positive infinity on the y-axis so every one of them is climbing from all the way down there to all the way up there so our range is negative infinity to infinity on the y-axis this is not true for evens range for evens is from zero to positive infinity or zero to negative infinity depending whether you have a negative in front of that that power function or not and the way we'd write that zero to positive infinity or negative infinity to zero signifying the upper half of the y-axis and the bottom half of the y-axis this is if you have a positive power power function so no negative in front uh then we'd go obviously upward that'd be zero infinity or if you had a negative front and reflected it we'd go from negative infinity up to zero they've always have to be written in order so i hope that makes sense to you i hope that you understand the idea of we're taking lead term and we're just seeing whether it's like this like that so odd positive odd negative or this or that even with a positive even with a negative that's pretty much it one thing that i i really i wasn't i said it i didn't write it down i just want to make sure that you understand that odd power functions are symmetric about the origin i always said that but make sure we write a little note there symmetric about origin so we have there this idea of rotate 180 degrees you the same picture and then symmetric about the y-axis we've talked about it but that's about it so we have key points we know that all odd power functions ever go through negative one negative one zero zero one one that gives us a climbing graph or positive or a falling graph if you reflect it ever even ever goes through negative one one zero zero and one one that is a climbing graph that's symmetric about the y if we have a positive inverter power function or reflect it we have this uh falling graph if or downward opening so that's a better way to say if we have an even with a negative part of it we have our range hey that's all real numbers uh for in for domain for both of these all real numbers for a range for odds not all real numbers for evens you're either going to choose the upper half or lower half of your y-axis depending whether you have a negative in front of your power function or not and then we have two different symmetries about the origin or this mirror image about the y axis now let's go on let's talk about graphing these with transformations we've um we've done this very quickly before uh we i'm sorry i've taught you this before we're gonna do this very quickly right now just to make sure that you see it one last time that this is uh uses some ideas of symmetry but because we're shifting it you're going to you're going to lose the idea of being an odd or an even function we're still going to use the fact that based on it but it's not going to be an even or odd function any longer because we've shifted away from the y-axis and away from the origin let me show you some ideas though so let's identify it with g of x first what's it based on is it based on an even power function or an odd power function of course we're going to look at the exponential that's an odd power function now honestly are you really going to want to distribute that and graph this as a polynomial because it is a polynomial but graphing that would say you don't just get to distribute the 5. you can't do that you could find your leading term that way but you don't just get to say hey x to the fifth plus 32 no no no you take x plus 2 times x plus 2 times x plus you five times distribute that then distribute the three and then subtract the constant of three and then you'd have a polynomial that's crazy if we have something that's nicely factored man what we can do is we can transform this we can use our transformations we should understand that that is a shift down three left two and that three impacts our key points so this is why we needed to know about the odd power function this is based on because this is going to give us key points so let's go through it if we shift down three and left two that's a horrible life too we have this idea of a new origin that's where the new origin would be if we take our key points and pretend that that is the origin then we can use the the sort of this was based on x to the fifth uh power function to graph from that point i've done this in transformations just kind of refresh your memory if our key points are negative one one zero zero and 1 1. why do we know it because that's an odd that odd says every power function with an odd degree is going to look like this going to have negative 1 1 0 0 1 1 we're just shifting it so we said yeah we're down 3 we left 2. what this does this says hey take your three multiply your outputs not your inputs one times three is three zero times three is zero one times three is three and if we graph these key points from our new sort of x y axis from our shifted x y axis we're gonna get a power function that's been shifted so we're taking two ideas we're taking the idea of transformations we're taking the idea of power functions and we're combining them we're saying this is a shift down three that's a shift left to this is a multiplication of an output times three we've talked about it before and that power five says you have an odd here odds are negative 1 1 0 0 1 1. put the ideas together let your shifting take you down 3 and left 2 let your power function say here's my key points let your multiplication of your output say here's my new key points and then plot them if we plot let's see negative one i'm sorry i messed up and you should have caught it hopefully i had my key point wrong so my key point should be negative one negative one zero zero one one that's negative one three times negative one is negative three zero zero so that's where i got messed up good thing i checked my workout as i was going zero zero one here's one one two three right there and if we go a little bit lower one two three i'm kind of estimating here we have a key point of from our origin negative one negative three zero zero and one three from our new origin we're working again we're combining these ideas this is where our power function would be based on after we shifted we're going to get a very dynamic climbing graph we know it's dynamic because that power 5. so we're using two ideas we're using shifting to get down 3 left 3 and then power function to get key points multiply them so let's take a look at it if we know it's a super dynamic graph and we're going through these points we're going to make sure that we go up make it crazy dynamic it's remember these are sketches here and we have a very good picture of that graph with very very minimal work that's the way we can use transformations down three left two the idea of key points from our power function negative one negative one zero zero one one the idea of multiplying that's another transformation idea and then shifting and getting the look of a power five power function where a sort of new x y axis is are these dotted lines actually here no it's a graphic organizer to give us a very good picture of what we're doing it's allowing us to take a look of a power function which is always at the origin and give ourselves sort of a new origin to graph it from it's not really new origin but it works really really well let's try the last one so one issue that we have is that polynomials are always in order and we really do want our transformations in order too so with that being in order let's take a look at it first thing that i want popping into your head is what type of a power function this is based on so we just look at the exponent go that's a power four so how do power fours look well they're symmetrical some way either upward or upward upward or downward but they're symmetrical they also have some key points key points for these even power functions our negative one positive one kind of messed it up before zero zero and one one so those are our key points what we're gonna do is allow our transformations our shiftings to move our origin to adjust our key points and let us graph a power function it's sort of a new origin it's not really there but it allows us to use these ideas in conjunction with one another so we sort of have a feel freezing look at least the symmetry about some sort of an axis of symmetry we know our shift says we're going to be going up three we're going to be going right to and that creates this new origin this new x and y axis where we can graph a power power function from is it really going to be symmetric about the origin or about the y axis no it's going to be symmetric about your new origin or your new y-axis that's the point of why i'm having to do this we're sort of cheating at it we're using while we're thinking about it being smart about it and using two different techniques now let's let's go ahead and do it because our our key points are negative one positive one zero zero and one one and because we have this negative 1 that's being multiplied by our outputs it will affect our outputs it will reflect them so this would give us negative 1 negative 1 0 0 [Music] and positive 1 negative 1. and if we graph those in relation to our new x-axis zero zero is our new sort of origin negative one negative one right about there positive one negative one find it out there and then we understand this is a degree four that's very powerful that's very dramatic and we know that it's symmetric about our new y-axis this axis of symmetry and it's downward opening we expected it to be downward open because of that negative so let's go ahead and do that it's not a parabola sort of looks like one but it's more boxy it's much more dynamic very much sharper curves in this thing one thing i do want to say is these are sketches if you have to be more accurate you do things like hey plug in 0 to find your y-intercept so take and plug in 0 here and figure out what your y y-intercept would be plug in 0 here figure out what your y-intercept would be the actual y-intercept that you would you would have uh set this equal to zero to find x-intercepts sometimes it's not that easy and often times they're not whole numbers so if you had to do that you could also one thing that a lot of people do is they'll plug in a number outside of this range somewhere outside of this this interval somewhere they plug in something like five or four plug in something like negative one they get additional points however i gotta warn you that with these exponents like four five six they are just super up there super down there they get so dynamic so fast they're almost ungraphable uh for for things outside of where like your vertex should be or your your point of symmetry in this case here and here when we start getting way outside of that these exponents make values that are just huge or really really really negative and so they're very hard to graph so a little recap to make sure we got this power functions are one term what we're going to be doing is looking at the leading term and saying hey this is going to model the end behavior for us there's really only four of them because your your polynomials always have a domain of all real numbers never have any issues with it you can only have four looks they're all going to be continuous they're going to be smooth nice curves but they'll only look like this odd negative odd even negative even that's it all we have to do is be able to understand what our function is based on odd or even in this case maybe understand some shifting down three left two take that as an output multiplication that's a factor for your output here up three right to factor for your output multiply it and use your key points when we get to actual polynomials where we're graphing with um multiplicity and things like that we'll be there very very shortly our end behavior just says where we're pointed this this this or this and that's that's pretty much it so i hope that makes sense if you're a little bit sloppy on the the transformations maybe go back and check that video out about what the down three and the right the up three came from the left two and the right two because that might be confusing for you and how we take this number to multiply our outputs of our key points so if you forgot that maybe check it out other than that i hope you hope you saw what we did we just took the idea of a power function and the idea of transformations and we we just marry them together that way we can use the ideas of a power function hey there's symmetry we're just moving the place of symmetry by by transformations hey there's uh there's key points we're just moving where the key points are by transformations as pretty cool odds are symmetric about the origin even symmetric about the y-axis so if we move those things we still have that sort of symmetry just somewhere else so i hope it makes sense i hope that you are still with me and next time we'll talk about getting into zeros of polynomials and getting into multiplicity have a great day
