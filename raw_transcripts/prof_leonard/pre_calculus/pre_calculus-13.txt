Transcript for: Graphs You Must Know (Precalculus - College Algebra 13)
hi welcome to another video in this video we're gonna start building on your understanding what graphs are so we're gonna talk about some basic graph shapes or a library of functions basically Mansa functions you need to know do you need to memorize them yes but I don't want you to just memorize their shapes I want you to understand why they're shaped the way they are that's a big difference so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to talk about what these are I'm going to talk about where what these functions are as far as even versus odd what their key points aren't that is the biggest thing we're gonna talk about and then why they're shaped the way they're shaped so and how to remember some of these things the reason why is because in the next video we're going to talk about how to transform these which means how to shift them up down left right stretch compress horizontally vertically reflect about the y axis x axis things like that and if we don't understand how these graphs work it's very difficult to not be not understand how they work and still be able to transform them so we're gonna have this understanding what these functions look like why they are the way they are and most importantly what their basic points are so they're their key points so we're gonna start with this one and then after this one we'll talk about even versus odd and how these things are structured so when we say what's the function f of B actually looked like it says sorry f of X equals B what's that actually looked like so there's no matter what you plug in you get constant what's a constant function look like that's gonna be a horizontal line so when it says plug in any X you get out B we've got this idea of a horizontal line what what what's its inputs all the real numbers what's its output just be I want you to notice right away though that's an even function it has symmetry about the y axis that's even no problem we have this symmetry idea in fact every one of these functions the way I've written it for you is even even even that one's going to be neater and then we're going to have on on on odd and I'll talk about why they are the way they are let's talk about f of X equals x this says that if I plug in an x value I'm gonna get that x value as an output so the input and output are both the same i plug in want to get a 1 plug in 2 I get up to plug in 3 get up 3 that right there says if I plug in 1 you know 1 if I plug in negative 1 I have negative 1 but plug in 0 I get up 0 I'm going to pause there for just a second I don't want to talk about how every single odd function in your library functions it's going to have two key points that are all the same and then I also want to talk about how most of them have one key point additional two that every one of these odd functions is going to have one one and negative one negative one as two points in your graph every odd function has that so these are all going to have one one negative one negative one let's look at this take one plug it in 1 cubed is 1 ok there's one one take negative one plug in negative one cubed is negative one it has negative one negative one and it has one one take zero plug it in it has zero zero so wait a minute that's the same exact key points is that one one one zero zero negative one eighty one one one zero zero negative 1 negative 1 I know every odd basic graph shape is going to have those that one doesn't have zero zero but almost for obvious reason how about the cube root of x if I plug in 1 the cube root of 1 is 1 it's gonna have that point 1 1 plug in negative 1 the cube root of negative 1 is negative 1 it's gonna have negative 1 negative 1 plug in 0 the cube root of 0 is 0 keep in mind with cube roots you can plug in negatives a cube root of a negative number 2 says what says what number when I take the cube root of it gives me this particular output or in other words this output if I cubed would give me the radicand of that that cube root well what that means because cubes maintain signs a negative cube gives you a negative that means a cube root of a negative maintains that negativity so we can plug in negative and we just find this is not a one-sided graph and it has the key points of 1 1 0 maybe when they give one the last function over there says well let's see if I plug in 1 1 divided by 1 is 1 so it has a key point of 1:1 but plug in negative 1 1 divided by negative 1 is also negative 1 but if i plug in 0 that's a problem hmm if I plug in 0 1 divided by 0 is undefined how does undefined in this look in a function well we talked about that a lot in the many more videos than this but what this is going to give you is this vertical line that you cannot touch sometimes an undefined function means you visit a point we talked about in last video how you just have this open circle and we can have that's called a hole or removable discontinuity in this case this is a vertical asymptote and we will talk about why it's a vertical asymptote a little bit I can't I can't lie can't wait for it's a vertical asymptote because the the factor on your denominator that's giving you a zero namely X cannot be cancelled out can't be simplified away on your numerator so we have this vertical asymptote we actually also have a horizontal asymptote what well what's the one output value you can't get can you get an output value of zero plug in a number and give me an output for 0 I can't the numerator is 1 all the time 1 divided by any other number besides 0 is going to give you not 0 so this has a vertical asymptote and it has a horizontal asymptote here's what I need you to know about this library of functions number one when I look at X X cubed cube root of x or 1 over X I have some key points here all of these graphs have the point 1 1 and negative 1 negative 1 almost all of them have zero zero this doesn't because that point that value for zero is not defined for your domain so what man if all of them have one one negative one negative one and most of them have zero zero do they all look the same and the answer's no here's what I would like you to stretch your knowledge as for your basic graph shapes number one these are all going to be odd functions what that means they will have symmetry about the origin we can rotate them 180 degrees or reflect reflect and get the same exact graph out they do have that symmetry these will all be odd the difference between them is that as our power increases we've so we sort of get more curvy so like X to the first power is just a line our output equals our input and so line X to the third power is going to take that line sort of so in a curve and give it more of a dynamic feel if we've actually the fifth that's even more dynamic a cube root of x takes that the X to the third and sort of rotates it reflects it about the white was X line that our inverses on top button versus much later but the way that this is shaped is differently so what I need you to understand is number one every one of these graphs is going to have a key point of one one every one of them sides are constant our odds are going to have a key point of negative one negative one our evens are gonna have a key point of negative one positive one because of the symmetry about the y almost all of them have a key point of zero zero the only limit doesn't is now so our features our key points and now shape so the shape of our graph our line gives us just this straight line so f of x equals x is a nice straight line X cube is this graph where we still have this negative infinity to positive infinity idea on the y axis but it's definitely more dynamic in a straight line the cube root of x takes this graph rotated about the y equals x axis x takes this graph rotates it about this line and we hit this this picture sort of flipped on its side that's what the graph looks like this got very weird this graph says I have a vertical asymptote asymptote is spelled like this it means basically the MC hammer version of a line do to do to do to do you can't adjust you cannot touch a vertical asymptote horizontal asymptotes you can cross them in like some some range some interval that Texas but as you get two infinities like way out there you're not going to touch and you're going to approach them so what that means is that if you can't really touch it your graph has to will let see has to has to go through that point no probably no that cannot touch this at all won't touch this one at all it's going to look like this same thing here some people call this the reciprocal function because you put an input in there and it reciprocate sit so you put in like five it gives you an output of 1/5 put it in five you don't want it put in 1/5 get out five put in negative 1/5 get up negative five put it in 85 get out negative 1/5 that's the way this graph looks it is a rational function sometimes called the reciprocal function here's the main point I need you to understand about this number one all of these graphs have a key point of one one zero zero and negative one negative one the only one of those is that does not have zero zero they are all odd look at it look at how the symmetry is about the origin I could rotate these hundred eighty degrees even this one I could rotate hundred eighty degrees every one of these functions is odd the first three are increasing the entire time this is increasing increasing increasing X lower rate but increasing this graph is always decreasing decreasing decreasing so all of them are all of them have key points I need you to understand where they come from why they look the way they do and what their key points are I need to understand the increasing of the first three I need to understand the decreasing the last one those all have to make sense to you I need you to give it your domain all real numbers all real numbers all real numbers you cannot have zero this does not have a value and output value for the input value zero so your domain is everything except zero your range all real numbers all real numbers all real numbers so the interval of the y-axis that these graphs cover are all real numbers for the first three but again you can't get out zero so your domain interval the x-axis is you cover is all real numbers interval the y-axis you cover so you arrange all real numbers here your domain is all real numbers except zero and your range is all real numbers except zero all right we got to move on to the the evens so that these two match of these three are even your domain all real numbers but let's look at x squared if I wanted to define my key points here let's plug in 1 by plug in 1 2 x squared I get out 1 if I plug in 0 2 x squared I get out 0 plug in negative 1/2 x squared let's say negative 1 squared is 1 see that's a bad mix if I plug in 1 to the absolute value of X absolute value of 1 is 1 i plug in 0 if x value of x absolute value of 0 is 0 I look like a negative 1 the absolute value of negative 1 is positive 1 are you seeing the evenness are you seeing that this has symmetry about the y axis unplug in opposite inputs I'm getting the same output I'm putting in opposite if it's I'm getting the same output this one's not but I want to focus on these two so let's go through why on the shape of the graph the absolute value of x is based on the function of X is based on that it's just saying where you have negatives I want you to make it positive so it keeps this side it takes this and goes let's just make every output positive it's going to give you a V that's what the absolute value of X graph looks like is it still even of course it's even has symmetry about the y-axis and has the the idea that if I take negative X algebraically and I evaluated for negative x the absolutely negative x is positive x or any house for any X yeah how about x squared so with x squared I'm not going to be a straight line it's given me what's called a parabola that's a rough estimate of a shape of x squared that's it's this parabolic this parabola that we have and now they plug in 2 I get up four it's definitely not a straight line is it even yeah I have symmetry about the Y if I take negative X and square it I get positive x squared value of x that's the that's the idea so these are our two graphs I want to talk about them like we did here firstly do you notice that every single one of them has the value that both of these have the values of 1 1 0 0 negative 1 1 every even besides their constant every even basic graph shape is going to have that for you you're gonna plug in 1 get 1 look at NATO and get a positive 1 not negative 1 you also have 0 0 notice how we're decreasing for this interval next and then increasing decreasing for this interval of X that increasing so our domain all real numbers domain all real numbers rains range just from 0 to infinity range just from 0 to positive infinity the last one the square root of x is an inverse of x squared what an inverse means we're going to find this out much later is that you take your graph and you reflect it over the y equals x money basically flip it over a diagonal line so it takes this graph and flips it but in order to flip it you need to restrict your domain you say okay well I can only flip one part of this which one you want to flip would you flip the positive part because if I flip both I get this parabola that's non functional is function I don't want to do that if I flip it over so we're going to restrict it what that means is that when we get our graph you're only get out of one side of graph and you're only gonna get this top part if I plug in 1 I get up 1 squared of 1 is 1 plug in 0 I do get out 0 but just like this parabola has no negative outputs this square root can have no negative inputs if you just take and put on side domain becomes range range becomes domain I can't even plug in a negative number we could try it we'd say plug in negative 1 you screwed a negative 1 is I I don't know what that looks like on a graph of course it's not a real number and these graphs are based on functions that have outputs there are real numbers and so since we say that this has no real output it doesn't have something graphically on a real number system that we can graph so this is not allowing you even a plug in negative numbers that means you can't get anything out there's no output on this interval of your x-axis our domain it's just 0 and more so positive numbers including 0 are our range is 0 and more so the interval that y-axis this graph will eventually cover is from 0 to positive infinity it's basically half a parabola on its side these are the graphs that I really need you to know I need you to memorize the shapes I really do we can't afford to be plugging in numbers all the time because of transformations it's going to take absolutely forever and you're probably still not going to get a great graph so what I want you to understand is that constants are horizontal straight lines there's not a lot more than we can say about that besides they are constants they maintain the same out of the value and they are even then what I did as I organized these so that you can look at me oh hey every single one of these graphs is going to have some key points to it almost all of them have 1 1 & 0 0 so every single one of these basic functions in our library functions has one one every one of them almost all of them will be step two this one has a key point of 0 0 most of them so all of our odds have negative 1 negative one negative one negative one negative one all of our evens have negative 1 positive 1 and then the only limits and I'm neither has neither of those that should make sense to you I want you to organize your thoughts like that only that your thoughts like ok man are our odds have 1 1 0 0 negative 1 negative 1 or even to have 1 1 0 0 negative 1 positive 1 there's an ether that has neither negative 1 1 or negative 1 negative 1 keys can't plug in negative 1 and then our kind of awkward function or reciprocal function doesn't have a 0 to 0 does it make sense to you are you seeing that we have 1 1 for a key point on although we have 0 0 for key point on almost all of them we have negative 1 positive 1 for our evens we have negative 1 negative 1 for our odds even this one or missing 0 0 on that we don't have negative 1 anything for our square root I need you to memorize key points I need you to memorize the shapes of these graphs that's really important I hope I've done a good job of explaining to you why they are shaped the way that they are how do you kind of view some of our awkward functions in terms of our previous functions where we're increasing where we're decreasing and whether we're even or odd get that down before the next video because the next video I'm going to show you how to transform things how to shift them up and down and left right are key points and our shapes are crucial for that so I'll see you for the next video you
