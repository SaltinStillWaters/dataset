Transcript for: Introduction to Radians (Precalculus - Trigonometry 3)
hey welcome to another video so in this video you're going to learn about radians so we're going to learn about radians and how they're different from degrees where they come from where they see what the foundation of them is and how to convert between them actually it's probably the next video but we're going to have a very good foundation when we get there about why in the world they are different how they're different how to how to use them so here's where radian stems from a radian is an angular relationship between a radius and an arc length that's equal to that radius in other words if you take a radius of a circle a central angle that cuts an arc and compare them a radian is the angle that makes the arc equal to the radius and that's what that statement says it's kind of kind of wordy but a radian is a central a angle needed on any circle and that's a big point it doesn't matter whether the circle is small or large one radian is the same relationship on any circle that we have very much like one degree it doesn't matter the size of the circle one degree represents a swept out angle well a radian does the same thing but it's measured differently it's a relationship between a radius and an arc length being equal and so the radian on a central angle a radian is a central angle needed on any circle to make the arc subtended which basically just means this arc that's cut by two radii equal to the radius so how's it look if we really wrap your heads around what the idea is it's kind of a simple idea the idea is hey take a circle and cut an arc with two radii that's equal to the radius that's what it says it says if your radius is one or your radius is four i'm going to put that up there in a minute if your radius is one or four or 20 or 0.5 it doesn't matter if you take those radii they're going to be the same from the center of a circle that's what a radius is it's the distance from the center to the edge of your circle and you start opening that well your arc length that portion of the circle that you're cutting is growing and growing and growing and growing if you make it so that the arc length is equal to each of the radii which have to be equal almost looks like an equilateral triangle except one side is the arc well then once you have that angle that central angle that's at the center of the circle is called one radian that's that's the unit of measurement that we use for radiance it's what it means it's not some magic thing it's very much like a degree but measured differently so the size of one radian never changes it's just the relationship that makes the radii equal to the arc length that they are cutting and so i'm going to show that to you so let's suppose that we have a unit circle what a unit circle is is a circle with a radius of one i don't even care what the unit is notice how those radii are creating a central angle and also how those radii once they're they're opening that arc length if that's equal to the radius whatever units they are then the angle around the center of that circle right here that is one radian let's call that alpha for now we would say that alpha is one radian that's where that comes from now what if the radius is four it doesn't really matter as long as or 14 whatever as long as the arc that's cut by two radii equals the radius itself well then the angle swept out the central angle that central angle is just an angle that has its vertex at the center of a circle let's call that alpha as well alpha is also equal to right one radian we can sort of abbreviate that rad sometimes you'll see that which is kind of rad uh anyhow that that's all the radian is so if you really want the long story you're basically just opening up two radii and cutting a portion of the circle that's a subtended arc that's equal to the radius and on any circle you do that the angle that you get is one radian i hope that makes sense i hope that it's kind of taking away some of the confusion maybe you heard this word rating i have no idea what that means well this is exactly what that means now on the on the other hand what if we open up an angle of 1 radian could you tell what the arc was very easily it would be equal to a radius well what happens if the angle isn't exactly 1 radian well then we can use a proportion to find it i'm going to walk you through that right now so let's suppose that we have a radius r and r and we're going to open this up exactly one radian where alpha is equal to one radian now do you know the alpha is one radian right now you kind of have to because if this is r and that is r and the arc that's subtended or cut by those radii is also r we understand that's the definition of what a radian is and so we we would know right now it looks kind of like an equilateral triangle of course it's not because we have an arc but if radius equals radius which it has to that's the center so that has to be that way but if this is also equal to r that arc that is one radian in the middle you have to trust that because that's the definition of what a gradient is so what happens if we have a smaller or larger angle can we figure out the arc length from that i'm going to walk you through how to do that hopefully it's obvious to you that this would still be r and this would still be r but this right here would not let's call this arc length s and let's call this angle here theta in your head right now i want you thinking is theta 1 radian is it more or less well it kind of looks less we don't really know it's not really down on the scale but we do know a few things about this we know that this would all be one radius or the whatever the radius is because they all stem from the center of the circle we do know that if this arc length is r that that is one radian if this is less than r this would be less than one radian by a predictable amount on the other hand we know that if this is one radian that creates an arc that's equal to radius if this angle is less than one radian it's going to create an arc that's less than your radius and by a predictable amount by a proportion and so we can find a very nice formula for arc length right now i'm going to show you how to do that if we have this proportion where the radius compared to the angle or the i should say the arc length the arc length compared to the angle that cuts it has to be in the same proportion as the arc length compared to its respective angle that cuts it or subtends that arc length so let's look real careful make sure we understand it make sure we understand that hey r this arc length compared to alpha which is when radian we'll get to that in just a second must be the same proportion as a smaller arc length cut by a smaller angle those have to be equal i hope you're seeing i hope you've seen the proportion r sort of equals s yeah they're the arc length idea and alpha sort of equals or corresponds to corresponds to that theta we can put that in the same relationship now one thing that i just said please remember that in order for this r to be the radius and the arc length this angle has to be one radian now this is a big deal because what it means is that the formula we're creating will not work for degrees it will only work for radians why because it's built into our proportion and so we're going to say that this is 1 radian now if we hadn't done that then we can use some some things with degrees but we do do that and we see this formula very often in math where s is going to equal r times theta and a lot of people try to use that for degrees you can probably see it's going to happen and that's wrong because we're making this assumption that we're dealing with one radian to get that arc length of r so if r divided by one rating the arc length that's created by one radian well okay that we have that's gonna be equal to the radius has to still be in the same proportion as a smaller arc length compared or a different arc length compared to a different angle if we multiply both sides by theta if we multiply both sides by theta check this out what we really have multiply both sides by theta this is going to say all right theta cancels here we got theta we got all r times theta but notice something what happens of that that really would be down here now now use your unit conversions to think about what it would take in order to cancel out that idea of a radium that unit well that's a unit of length r is an arc length and it equals the radius because we had chosen an angle of one radian but that's a unit of length it'd be like centimeters or meters or feet or whatever well this is a radian that's one unit one rate one of that particular unit of a radian in order for that to be cancelled this has to be measured in radians do you see it are you seeing that your angle would have to be radians to get rid of that unit so that your arc length matches the units here that's very important if you try to plug in into degrees sorry plug in degrees to the formula we're about to get you're going to run into some very major issues now if we hadn't put one rate in there it would be okay but we'd have to have a degree a degree for that particular relationship between radius and arc length that are equal so going back to here just making a note on this this only works for radians because of what we did right there and so their units simplify so our length is always equal to r times theta the central angle that's creating that or subtending that arc but it only works for radians i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing the why why that is so if you want to do a little recap we're going to do some convergence here in just a little bit uh finding arc length and finding some angles from this but if you want a little recap here here it is a little 20 second recap radians are different than degrees in how they are measured so a degree is 1 360 of a circle or a rotation around stopping where you start a radian is is different from that a radian comes from a circle idea and it says what a reading is is if you have a radius one radian is a central angle that's needed in order to create an arc length that's cut by two radii that equals the radii so basically open it up and tell the arc length equals the radius and you have a radian now we work a lot with radians and this is the first formula that we really get with it and you can see it only works with radians and this happens very frequently in math where we get some formulas that only work with a certain type of angle in this case that angle is radians and it has to be there in order for our units to cancel right here in fact everyone knows us so much they don't even put over 1 radian because we understand it only works for radians and that's why we don't put that but can you see how a lot of students who don't grasp this you've never seen this before they go radiant i don't know just whatever let's put anything in there it doesn't work it does not work and so make sure that you understand that this only works for ratings because the reasons i've said don't plug in degrees like some students are prone to do don't be one of those students now let's go ahead and see if we can find arc length from angles and angles from arc length so let's suppose we have a couple examples we have a circle with a radius of 6 feet and we have a central angle of 1 3 radians notice how i have to put that radians there otherwise we have no idea that we're dealing with any sort of angle whatsoever it's definitely not degrees so what that means is that we have this idea of oh right well what if this angle isn't one radian one full radian it's just a third of a radian well we should understand what that means now we understand that that arc length should be well not as big as the radius it should be a actually a third of that and that's exactly what this formula does it's very very nice so we can use it but it's kind of an intuitive idea it's just a proportion so let's set it up 4 radians because of that right there you got to cancel that out that you know our arc length is always equal to the radius times the central angle that's creating the arc length now it appears here that we have a unit issue it appears that we we're looking to go okay 6 feet times 1 3 radians would be let's see two feet radians but because of where the formula comes from assuming that we're dealing with a uh first subtended arc length that's created by one radian this really has this over one rating idea we normally don't put that radian because of that reason because i explained to you that this only works for radians we only try to plug in radians and we rarely show that but it is there and we would get just six feet times one-third that's two two feet so if you have a radius of six feet and you have this arc that's subtended by an angle of one-third radians a central angle one-third radians that arc length is going to be exactly two feet it's kind of cool that we we can measure around a circle we use this for some very valuable things in fact in a little while we're going to use it on how to convert between degrees and radians radians and degrees now let's do the next one what if we had a radius of 12 meters an arc length of 16 meters could we figure out the central angle that's needed to create that that situation now now think about it if this arc length is more than the radius your central angle should certainly be more than one radian and that's what's going to bear out for us we can still set up the same way and when we put this in here we understand that when we when we substitute and evaluate this we'd have 16 meters as our arc length we got a radius of 12 meters times whatever our angle is now keep in mind because this only works for radians when you divide 16 meters by 12 meters and you get four thirds the meters cancel and it appears that theta is a unitless measurement it's not radians are built in it's right here we just don't write it so just keep that in mind when we get an angle out of formulas that only work with radians they're in terms of radians so four thirds of a radian or one and one thirds radians or one point three three three three radians i'm really hoping i explained it well enough for you for you to understand what a rating is where it comes from the relationship i know i've repeated myself several times i'm doing it on purpose so that we understand what it really comes from because we're about to start converting between degrees and radians and we need to understand several things about them number one that while they measure differently they can do very similar things tell you the size of an angle that sweeps out an arc or a portion of x y axis we need to be very comfortable going back and forth between them but we also need to understand that a lot of the formulas that we deal with only work with one type of unit measurement or you have to convert or go back and redevelop the formula so be careful with that most of our our trigonometry as we deal with calculus is in radians almost all of it there's a few times when that's not the case but almost all of it deals with this radiance it's just the general way that the people go it's a little bit nicer you're going to get a lot of pies like 3 pi over 2 and things like that and so we're gonna we're going to get into that next video i'm going to show you how to convert between degrees radians radians and degrees so i'll see you for that you
