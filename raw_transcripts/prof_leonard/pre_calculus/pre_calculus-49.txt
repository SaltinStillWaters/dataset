Transcript for: Finding Domain of Composite Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 49)
hey there now that we have a good idea about what a composition of functions actually means we're going to practice that but at the same time we're going to explore what the domain of a composite function or when you compose two functions for composition functions how do you find that like what that is because it's really important sometimes when we compose functions they end up losing some pieces that we need to know for the domain and so i'm going to give you a very good technique on how you deal with the domain of composite functions which is important to know especially when we get into exponentials and logarithms and calculus so let's take a look at an easy example that we have done in the last video and i'll tell you what all this stuff means so let's let's start learning about it if i give you two functions f and g and i ask you to compose them f of g or any sort of permutation of those two functions we know that we take the first function open up with a blank space and put the second entire function inside of it so i'm going to call this the inside function the function you're composing and the function you're composing upon so this g of x this inside function that's really important we need to understand the domain of that inside function that is the most important thing that i can get you to know is find that first and don't lose it you see when we find a composition of two functions or a composite function we'd say the domain's a combination of two pieces it's the domain of the inside function and the domain of the simplified composition that we get so the whole idea it's not hard you just need to know it the whole idea is you find the domain of really both functions because we most of the time compose f of g and g of f at the both of them almost all the time and so it's really useful to find your domains first but in general you find the domain of the inside function first so we look at this and say that's my inside function that's my inside function find your domain do the composition simplify the composition find the domain of the simplified composition and then combine those two that's all there is to it so here's what we would do here's a process these domains are going to be all real numbers i talked about in the last video but here's what we would do i'm going to find f of g of x and i know it's already done so and i've actually erased some of it uh there doesn't really matter so i know it's already done here's the thought process here's my inside function it's g of x i know this is going to go inside f of x so i'm going to look at g of x i'm going to find my domain so my head i'm thinking okay well what's the domain i don't see any square roots good news i don't see any denominators with fraction with variables in them that's good news now let's see logarithms that's good news that means the domain and the absence of those three things is all real numbers we also can use interval notation negative infinity to positive infinity so i know that that's in the back of my head that the domain of the inside function is right there then i do my composition okay i've already done it i get down to here this i sort of i erased it's three and we would take a look at it and say okay now that we have a simplified composition of these functions what's the domain of this well i haven't added any fractions i've already gained any fraction of the denominators that have variables in them i don't have any square roots still and i don't have any logarithms still so the domain here is all real numbers the domain of your composition is a combination of your inside domain and the final domain that you get so this domain is all real numbers what we got domain is still all real numbers we combine those you get all real numbers you don't get double all real numbers but you get all real numbers negative infinity to positive infinity that is how you find domain the same thing would happen here i'm just going to talk through it real quick the domain of our inside function f is all real numbers the domain of our final simplified version of our composition is all real numbers we combine those two you still have all real numbers remember you're only looking for really three things and one of which we haven't talked about yet so you're looking for any sort of radicals that have even powers even fractional powers so like one half powers one fourth powers or square roots fourth sixth roots you're looking for radicals you're also looking for fractions that have denominators that could possibly equal zero so any sort of denominator with a variable you check that we're looking for those two things do we have them originally are we creating them those things are important to know logarithms come later we just we haven't covered them so you're not going to see them yet that's the main idea here so we're going to move on to some more complicated examples that don't have domains that are all real numbers but again this is what we're checking for all right let's get after it we've got an example here where i'd like to find the composition f of g of x and g of f of x with the domains of these things so keep in mind we can still do f of f and g of g i'm just not going to get into it because these are the most common and if you understand these you can do those as well we've already talked about last video so let's find f of g of x the first thing we want to do before we start this if we are required to know the domain which you are almost all of the time we're going to take the time to find the domain of both of these functions first why so we won't forget about it and that way we don't think that our domain is something that it's not so i'm going to take a look at this and i'm going to firstly find the domain of both of these functions so on f of x i know that this has a fraction the variable has as a denominator has some variables in it and if we have a denominator that equals zero we've got a problem it's going to create a vertical asymptote but in general you have something that creates an undefined output and so we know that x plus three if that equals zero we get some problems so i know that our domain in simple form here is x cannot equal negative three that would create a problem for us that's an issue g of x i'm going to take the time to find that domain as well if x equals 0 we have a problem so the domain of g of x is x cannot equal zero f of x is x cannot equal negative one all real numbers besides those two values work just fine in those two functions now we're going to find f of g of x in your head right now i want you thinking what's my inside function what's the function i'm not composing into that i'm using to compose onto another function the inside function here is g of x you'll see it as we write it but our inside function is g what's going to happen we're going to compose this we're going to simplify it and then we're going to take the combination of two different domains what we get when we're done combined with what was inside when we started so for sure for sure our domain is going to have whatever the domain of the inside function is in there somewhere x cannot equal 0. we know that it's going to be a combination of domain inside and the end so here's our inside domain that is why we find it first because this will not leave us now i warn you as we get through here that domain may or may not show up in the final composition we might simplify the way it might move from a numerator to a denominator which is why we find it first because if you don't find that first it's very very common for students to do this without doing that and then lose that piece because they think well oh you can plug in 0 which is fine now remember something about domain you can't ever really make it better it always carries its baggage with it so because this came from here it's always going to have that condition it's always going to not be able to it's never going to be able to let you plug in zero no matter how much it looks like it so now let's continue with our with our composition so this composition says take a look at the function f hey here's a function f replace all of the variables so if you have a polynomial with many variables it's averaging one of those variables replace all of the variables with a parenthesis that's a blank spot for us so x hey blank space x blank space that's what x's mean anyway this thing that you can plug into and then plus three so we replace all of the variables in our first function with blank spaces now take your second function in its entirety and plug it in so i'm going to plug in 2 over x and 2 over x that is the second function that we're composing into the first function and now we simplify it notice this is where you can identify easily if you hadn't been able to before what your inside function is the function you're composing so that's going to be 2 of x or 2 over x and 2 over x and that's where we get our domain from and then we have to simplify this and yes you do have to simplify it so how do we simplify this well because the parentheses really aren't super relevant right now just give us a place to put that function we have 2 over x divided by 2 over x plus 3 this is a complex fraction how we deal with complex fractions is multiplied by the lcd on both the numerator and the denominator so our lcd here is x let's take x let's multiply it by x over x now stop right now and watch what we've done please get this what you've just done think about it this will make this make sense what you've just done is you've multiplied by one right right follow me here you've multiplied by one but only if x is not zero because if x is zero zero divided by zero is not one what is it it's undefined you can't do this if x is zero this condition allows you to even do this thing if this is not here then you cannot do that if x is zero that needs to make sense to you this is not one if x is equal to zero it's undefined if x is equal to zero it's undefined you can't do what you're doing if x is allowed to be zero which is why we have that restriction and why it maintains in this problem even though it looks like it's going to disappear you need it watch that a couple times if that does not make sense i've explained it but it's got to sink in that you wouldn't even be able to do this without that restriction so we've done it now we're going to simplify remember that we do distribute 2 over x times x your x's are going to cancel you're going to get 2. here we distribute 2 over x times x is going to cancel you're going to get 2 but here nothing cancels you get plus 3x so our simplified composition is two over three x plus two notice something does it look like you can plug in zero here yeah no doubt like if you were to plug in zero right now it'd be just fine if you were allowed to do it this is why we write down the domain of our inside function and the domain of that inside function first before i did any work i do this every time i look at my inside function i identify my domain i write it down because i know that a lot of times it disappears so i don't want to lose that so we've done that we have it simplified and now we've also developed another domain problem check it out it's not the same domain problem as this one it's new and this happens when we start dividing functions or composing functions sometimes we get additional domain restrictions you've seen that a long time ago we just get it again in a different context so we have two over three x plus two oh my gosh as a fraction i've got some variables on the denominator i know that if my denominator equals 0 i have some problems so when we subtract 2 and divide by 3 this creates another issue for us something else that's undefined so any sort of value that causes this to be undefined is a problem i'm going to take this i'm going to also add this to my domain so i already knew from the inside function x to not equal 0. we explored that a lot right here but now i also can't allow x equals negative two-thirds any other values besides those are going to be just fine but those things themselves those are problems i hope that makes sense to you you take your inside domain you put it down first because it can sometimes disappear and you don't want to lose it but for the reasons i've already mentioned you cannot plug in zero even though it looks like it we also gain some other domain restrictions so take the combination of those two ideas that is your domain okay let's move on to the next one so g of f of x well our inside function changes we're still going to do the same technique but before i even start this i'm going to say all right my inside function is f of x if i can't identify it now i write g of f of x and this way i look at g my first function i notice that's 2 over x i'm going to create 2 over a blank space so that's my first function g written in such a way that i can compose into it i look at my second function f okay f says x over x plus 3. i'm going to take that x over x 3 and i'm going to put it inside this blank space this variable this has taken f of x and put it inside the variable of g of x is exactly what we want now i can really easily identify what my inside function is my inside function is f of x it's the second function so i'm gonna start building my domain now because i already have this domain i know that no matter what happens i'm going to take this domain and i'm going to have that inside the domain of my final composition so i know for sure that x cannot equal negative 3 i'm going to write it down now so i don't lose it and i'm probably going to get some other restriction out of this well we do have a complex fraction again we know that the lcd is x plus 3 and how we deal with the x plus 3 is we multiply both the numerator and denominator by whatever the lcd is in this case x plus three now notice again for the same thing here if you allow x to be negative 3 this doesn't work if x is negative 3 then this becomes 0 over 0 and that is a problem for it it's undefined and so we have to restrict that to let this even work that's why finding the domain of a composition of functions is so important because you have to tell it when it's going to work it's only going to work if you don't allow x to be negative 3 you can't even do this if x is negative 3. so we're going to go ahead and multiply this is going to distribute but this is going to cancel you're multiplying x plus 3 on a numerator and denominator it's going to cancel even one but we're left with just x this right here is the composition g of f of x so we get 2x plus 6 over x and then we find the domain again this one's pretty nice we look at this and say hey if x equals zero if our denominator equals zero that's a problem that would create something that's undefined so i'm going to combine that with the domain already have notice how the it looks like you can plug in negative three just fine the only reason we have that is because this came from inside of the inside of our composition and we can see that we need that to be the case to even simplify this composition and so we're going to add something else to it we say hey we had that but we also can't allow 0. but those are the only two restrictions we have any other number in the world is going to be just fine in this composition if you want to see why this is true why you need this one try to evaluate if we try to evaluate negative three first we run negative three through f then you go okay if i evaluate for negative three that would be uh zero wait oh right there we can't we can't do it now try to do zero if we did zero so evaluate for zero because this is coming from n right makes maybe it doesn't make sense that we'd uh we couldn't evaluate that but evaluate for zero if we put zero into f first we get zero over three now that would be zero but when i take the output zero and put it in here to my first function g two over the output which was zero is undefined so even this one does not work if you try to evaluate it the the way that i showed you in the last video by taking 0 plugging into f that's 0 then plugging in that output into g 2 over 0 is undefined that's why these are both problems and that's how we deal with domain inside plus and gives you domain and composition all right this is the last example that we're going to do there are some that are a little more complicated but the idea is what i'm teaching right now on how to find this the reason why we're not getting more complicated with the structure of the problems is because that's not what this is about um what this is about is me teaching you how to find the domain now we have dealt with simplifying the algebra of tougher problems uh what we haven't done is found the domain yet that's why we're focused on that so we're going to compose this f of g of x and g of f of x we're focused on finding the domain and the aspects that pertain to us so how we do that is really important number one thing we're going to do is we're going we're going to find the domain of both of these functions y both because we're composing them in two different ways if we didn't if we just had this one i would only be focused on finding the domain of g of x i won't even care about f because i take the domain of my second function inside function and whatever i get at the end f really doesn't play into it in terms of finding the domain first here it does and so that's really important so composing two different ways affects what what domains we want to find in this case we're finding both so i'm going to start with f of x i'm looking at f of x i'm thinking does it have square roots no does it have denominators that have fractions in them no logarithms no the domain here is all real numbers now we go ahead we look at g of x we say oh that's a square root that has to have some domain issues if we have x minus 1 inside of it so we find the domain of g of x and say oh man i put anything back to it what is the domain of a square root what we know is that the inside of our square root has to be greater than or equal to zero we can't allow negatives inside of square roots in the real number system that is the way that you don't allow negatives what you don't do you don't set this thing equal to zero it's not a denominator don't do that that shows me that you don't understand the concept if you do it if you're doing that the concept here is inside not negative that's what that means when we solve this get our domain we know that x has to be greater than or equal to one in order to create non-negative numbers that's zero and positive inside of that square root and so we found our domain here's what's going to happen when we take care of f of g of x because g of x is our inside function in this composition our domain is going to have that no matter what happens it's going to have that so i'm going to do a couple things i'm going to show the composition i'm going to identify that g is actually the inside function i'm going to write the domain and then we're going to simplify so our composition says the first thing i want to do is i want to look at the first function f i want to replace the variables inside of it with some blank spaces so f is x squared plus 1. i'm going to replace the variables with blank spaces however many variables there are you replace them from with blank space so we can get some complicated things now i take a look at my second function i say all right my second function is g of x that is going to that's going to go inside the blank space so f is x squared plus one g is square root of x minus one i'm going to stop right now and if i haven't done it already i'm going to write out the domain right now the pieces i understand my inside function is g of x i should know it here but i can really see it here i'm going to take the domain of this which i've already found and then i'm going to simplify it and if i have to i'll add additional restrictions in there so let's go ahead uh wait a minute square root squared we know that every time a power matches a radical we simplify that but x minus 1 plus 1 is just x so f of g of x gave me x well that's interesting i'm going to tell you something right now that we're going to explore when we get to inverses in a few videos if you compose two functions and you end up getting x the two functions you compose are inverses they're going to undo each other if you compose them and i can prove it to you right now if you take any any number that you want that's in this domain that's a key feature right it's going to be in the domain for these should be inverse you'll talk about that in a minute but if you take any number leg let's say 10 if i if i take 10 i plug it into here take the output plug in here i'm going to get 10 back that's inverses 2. they undo everything about one another so just so work with me here if i take 10 10 minus 1 is 9 the number 9 and the square root of nine is three so that's the output right i plugged in ten i got out three take three the output plug it in here now three squared is nine nine plus one is ten wait a minute i plugged in ten i got the output pick that would plug in here and i gave it back ten it undid all the math i plugged in 10 i ran it through both functions i got out 10. that's what inverses do they undo each other that's exactly what this is saying it says what are you plugging in x what are you getting out x nothing's happening right because they und each other look at the math this under this this under this you have x remaining inverses undo one another and that is why when you compose two inverses you will always get x you're plugging in this you're getting out the same thing it's i've done all the math around it and that will happen every time with inverses now i said something very specific i said these are inverses and that's true but only on a certain section of the domain of the x-axis because it doesn't exist other places and so these are inverses under your domain that you already identified that's pretty neat you've already seen where these two things are inverses so as long as x is greater than or equal to 1 this function and that function are inverses because it matches up with our domain now uh well let's look back here let's finish this up does f of g of x have any of the domain issues well that doesn't have any square roots that is a radicals in general that are even this does not have any fractions and variables in the denominator no logarithms so this domain is all real numbers but it does not trump the fact that you have a domain issue already so we say all real numbers as long as x is greater than or equal to one this is there no matter what why because it had some baggage that we saw the inside function had a domain issue we have to we have to have that and if we don't then we are wrong on the fact that these two are inverses because if we don't have them we say oh they're inverses all the time no they're not no they're not they're only inverses on that domain that's why we need it all right let's talk about the last one if you've done it already awesome if not you can pause the video and see it at least if you can do the composition so g of f of x says let's take a look at our first function the first function is g so i'm going to replace my variables with some sort of blank space uh something i can plug into and evaluate that holds everything together that's what parentheses do for us then i take a look at my second function f of x okay f of x is x squared plus one i put the entire function in all the parentheses i've created there's only one in this case and before i simplify i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to start writing out my domain the domain domain's a combination it's a combination of the first function that you're sorry i'm sorry the inside function the inside function and the final composition after you simplify so the inside function is f of x from here and we can see x squared plus one and we know that that domain because we wrote down already is all real numbers so i'm going to write that down and if i have any domain restrictions i'll write that along with i'll say all real numbers except x can't equal whatever or all real numbers as long as they're greater than one but let's see what happens okay so i have square root of x squared plus one minus one well these ones are going to give me x squared minus 1 or plus 1 minus 1 is 0 square root of x squared gives me x well that's interesting i get the same thing as here and that is exactly true if you compose two inverses no matter which way you compose them you have to get the same thing and that same thing will always be x we talked about why here we said with inverses inverses undo each other then do everything about themselves so that what you plug in is what you get out in an inverse well if i if i undo them in the opposite way what you plug in is still what you get out in an inverse it's just done differently and you can see that here plus 1 minus 1. those those are inverses square root power 2. those are also inverses in certain domains so g of f of x is still equal to x now what's interesting is this does not gain me any additional domain issues so my domain there's no modification that the domain of the inside all real numbers the domain of the final final composition all real numbers our domain here is all real numbers now why are they different why is that domain restricted and this domain is not restricted why is that the answer is because when we take a look at what f of x does take a look at this take any number and plug it in you're going to get one or more take a look at it plug in anything you're going to get one or more that's your output right that's the range of this so the range of this is one or more the range of your inside function is the input of your uh the compose upon function so this has to give you one or more this works as long as your numbers that you're plugging in are one or more since the outputs here are one or more it matches perfectly with our domain there's never an issue which is why we don't have a domain restriction it's impossible to get something that would give you a negative inside of there with that particular function i hope that makes sense to you i hope you're seeing the value in finding domain that we're not even allowed to really work with these functions unless we need our domain which is why we need to know it so those that's how we compose functions um i hope it made it make sense i hope you understand the blank space and plug it in and now find a domain take the inside take the final put them together sometimes we don't have issues even when you might expect them sometimes we do when you don't expect them so i'll see you for another video we're going to start talking about one-to-one functions next and then inverses and eventually we be matching all these ideas together composition with inverses one-to-one functions exponentials and logarithms and getting something pretty fantastic on how we solve exponential and logarithmic functions i'll see you for that you
