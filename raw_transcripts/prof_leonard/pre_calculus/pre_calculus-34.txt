Transcript for: How to Use the Rational Zeros Theorem (Precalculus - College Algebra 34)
welcome to another video i hope that you are ready to learn one of the most powerful powerful things that i teach you in in this course uh which is the rational zeros theorem while i won't be going over a proof of the rational zeros theorem uh man this stuff is so useful it's kind of like a culmination of the last several videos where we put decarteural science we put long division of polynomials or synthetic division we put degree we put not necessarily rational number of turning points but we put the multiplicity together this idea of how to factor things when you don't have a general form it is extremely powerful so i'm going to talk a lot about factoring i'm going to talk about how the rational zeros theorem works uh what you do with it how it can help you and then we'll be doing a lot of synthetic division i'm not going to show you long division any longer i said i would do it every time for the video that we were in but at this point i'm going to do synthetic division when we're factoring out linears i will refresh your memory from time to time on long division polynomials because we'll need it later but i'll show you i'll show you some big division time and time again because it's so much faster and you're going to really appreciate it as we're going through this so let's get right into it what are you supposed to learn with this what you're supposed to learn with the rational zeros theorem is that if you know your coefficients from an ordered polynomial where you have a leading term and you have a constant term you can come up with a list of all the possible rational x-intercepts for that function and that is incredible now there's a couple pros and just a few cons that you have had to deal with number one the pros the pros are that this is going to give you factors without you knowing how to factor it that's awesome because factor means you can divide by it and so we can start dividing our function by factors so that we can factor the function and therefore graph it find x-intercepts do a lot of the things with it that's the major pro the cons are is that it can be quite tedious because you have a list of numbers it can be like 30 numbers long and you don't know what your x-intercepts are but they're on the list somewhere and so there's a lot of guessing and checking of course on this video this is going to be a long video firstly but on this video i'm going to know what those those zeroes are so it's going to seem like it's easier than it is because i'm not going to be checking 10 numbers before i get to one and that could potentially be the case uh the other drawback of the con is that this only gives you a list of possible rational zeros this does not give you square roots like radical zeros it doesn't give that to you so or complex zeros so if you have any complex zeros this list is not going to contain it if you have a zero like hey you cross out the square root of five this list is not going to contain it so those are the drawbacks but it's a great starting spot for us it's very very useful very very important um the other thing that i want to mention right before we get going is that oh my goodness remember your goals your goals here are to factor this polynomial that's the goal that's what we'll be getting to we started with factory polynomials we said oh multiplicity this multiplicity that we know end behavior we know how to graph it that's great but what if it's not factored that was the main question do you remember like that was the main question like what if it's not factored that's what we're answering so if your main goal is to factor this polynomial and i'm giving you a great technique for it if that's your main goal you should always try to factor this first i get this question a lot like well wait a minute what if i don't have a constant ha this technique doesn't work then well you're right because if you don't have a constant then you end with x and that means you automatically have a c f and you can factor out x therefore you should always always try to factor out x first every single time or factor something first or grouping or some other factor technique that's your goal your goal here is to get a factored polynomial completely factored so that you can find x-intercepts so that you can graph it with multiplicity and behavior and things that i've talked about already that's your goal so that's your goal try to factor first so here's the way the rational zeros theorem works firstly we got an ordered polynomial that's always an important thing and then we're going to do is we're going to find the factors of your constant term remember you should have one if you don't have one then you can factor it and your resultant polynomial that you get in parentheses that will have one and then you treat that as what you're dealing with so this works after you factor something that there's a correlator there if you factor out like a linear factor the rest of your polynomial can be redone with this that's pretty cool so we're always going to try factoring first we have an ordered polynomial find the factors of your constant that's it find the factors of your leading coefficient that's it and make a list of possible fractions from that your constant factors over your leading coefficient factors that's basically what this says in a nutshell here is a little more specifically if you have your your polynomial in order you have a constant uh that constant term will be last we typically call the the factors of the constant term this letter p why i don't know just sounded cool i guess so we we uh we write out that list of factors of our constants and then we have a leading coefficient you have to have one of those and you're going to find the factors of that leading coefficient remember a sub n just means the lead coefficient a sub 0 is just your constant then we typically call that list of factors q and then we say all right we've got this whole long list of numbers for p we have hopefully less numbers for q and then we take every sort of permutation of p divided by q so one divided by one one divided by whatever it is and we come up with this a list of this list of numbers and this list of numbers of p over q both positive and negative is a list of all the possible rational zeros that's basically it so let's go ahead and let's start i'm gonna go slowly through the first one i'm gonna remember why it's important to factor for the second one and then i'll have two more examples one of which uh both of which are long the last one i'm gonna do two different ways so you see there's sort of not multiple outcomes but multiple looks for an outcome every polynomial is uniquely factorable over linears and irreducible quadratics so there's no hey i got a different answer it might look a little different and i'll explain that when we get there so let's take a look at it uh f of x is 2x cubed plus 11x squared minus 7x minus 6 and you go all right the first thing i want to check is just a general overview of a couple things that i want you to know number one is it in order answers yeah that's an order could you tell me what the degree is you should be able to you should say yeah the degree's three okay cool could you tell me the end behavior could you tell me because the leading term is 2x to the third that that's an ah that's an odd power function that's positive it should look like that could you tell me your y-intercept y-intercept if you plug in zero would just be negative 6 your constant so we should have those things in the back of our head this is odd now what's that mean that means that you have to cross the x axis at least one time have to cross it not just bounce it you have to cross it at least one time that's interesting because odds have to end like this or like that you're going to have to cross it the next thing we'd say is that because the degree is 3 i will have at most 3 x-intercepts not 2 well sorry i could have two but not four not five i have at most three x intercepts that's it now i will have three solutions if i include complex numbers but at most three x-intercepts i don't have to have all three but at most three so i want to check those things the last thing i want to check before we get into rational zeros theorem is a way to save us work it's called the descartes rule of science and we studied it in the last video i do that every time because it can save us work is it imperative i said that last video that it's not necessarily imperative to do but if you want to save a lot of time it's very helpful so i start thinking about it the way it is in order the number of sign changes so this is positive positive to positive is not a sign change positive to negative is one sign change negative to negative is not a sign change there is only one sign change in this polynomial i hope that you see that there's only one sign change descartes rule of sign says that i am going to have exactly one positive x intercept had it been like five sign changes i'd write well i could have five positive x intercepts or three i subscribed to or one positive x intercept that that list was talked about in the last video so i would have five or three or one but that's the only options since i have only one sign change i can't subtract 2 from that that means that that's it that's the only positive x-intercept that i'm going to get and there's going to be one of them so there's one positive x-intercept 100 guarantee that's going to be there then i go through the process of evaluating for negative x again this is just the car to assign in motion what that lets us do is just change the the signs of your odd power terms so negative 2x cubed leave your evens alone 11x squared plus 7x leave your constants alone so change your odds leave your evens change your odds leave your constants and then we do the same thing how many sign changes negative to a positive is one positive to a positive is not a change positive negative is two there are two sign changes here what that means is that i will have either two or zero negative x-intercepts now let's see how this works out does it make sense with your degree i'm going to take a look at it does it make sense with your degree let's take a look how many can i possibly have for positives oh wait i'm going to have one how many could i possibly have for negatives either zero or two both of those would work one plus two is three that's the max one plus zero is one hey that's under our degree of three that actually makes sense now what we're going to do we're going to come up with our list and we're going to start finding out what our potential x-intercepts are so let's go ahead and do that here's the whole whole process do not do it from here it doesn't really you can it's not going to make a difference but do it from up here i want to always be looking at our original function we're doing most of this stuff so our original function says our constant term our a sub 0 is negative 6. let's find all the factors for a sub 0. so basically 4 negative 6. now does it matter if you have negative 6 or positive 6 no you're going to get the same list of numbers why well because if i tell you 6 both 1 and negative 1 divide that what else divides 6 well we know they come in in pairs so 1 times 6 gives us 6. think of the next number is 2 a factor of 6. yes and because we can divide six by two and get three three is also a factor of six that's the only factors that we have for six uh plus and minus one plus or minus two positive negative three positive negative six you go well one i know the constant's negative six it doesn't matter one still divides negative six and negative one also divides negative six so the signs aren't that important that's why it doesn't matter which one you use but we always just wanna make sure we're going back to the original so 6 or negative 6 does not matter you get the same list of numbers now how about uh how would our leading coefficient that would be 2. so this stands for your p and this stands for your q that's what that is if you're going out of a textbook they oftentimes will call the factors of your constant p and the factors of your leading coefficient q and then you make your list of p's over q's mind your p and q's my dad you should always say that to me i have no idea what that meant i guess i do now makes sense get your p's in order get your keys in order now for two this is positive two but it doesn't really matter because the factors are both positive and negative so what divides two well only one or two those are all the factors of negative six all the factors of positive two p and q and now we make our lists so our p over q the list of all the possible uh rational zeros rational means integer or whole numbers or well positive negative whole numbers or fractions that's what rationals mean so they wouldn't include square roots there are no square roots up there it wouldn't include complex there's not complex up there it's just positive negative whole numbers or fractions so let's go ahead and write it here's the way that we do this we start taking a combination of every p divided by every q so one divided by one two divided by one three divided by one and six divided by one that will give us a list of the first four uh possible numbers now when you see positives and negatives divided by positive negatives and that can be a little confused in our heads like wow what do i put just remember that a positive divided by positive is a positive as is a negative divided by negative and a positive divided by negative or a negative divided by a positive is negative so you don't need like four different signs just understand that this divided by this is either going to be positive or negative one two dividing positive negative two divided by positive negative one is either going to be positive or negative two and the same thing for three and the same thing for six i often get asked this question um are you always going to get just a repeat of this list down here the answer is yes because you're always going to have one as a factor for any number aren't you always one divides every number so one divides every leading coefficient so all of this list gets divided by one and basically just repeats where it gets a little bit more challenging is if you have a coefficient that's not one you'll have additional factors and this is where our fractions come in so we're going to start taking remember it's p over q one over two two over two three over two and six over two so we divide all of that so we took one divided by two two divided by two three divided by two and six divided by two if you um if you have a long a long list of factors this can get really tedious the way that i check my work is i look at how many factors i have so here's four here's two four times two is eight one two three four five six seven eight i haven't missed any so i take every combination every permutation of p divided by q and then we simplify them and we're going to get a little bit more of a truncated list because you oftentimes have some that are repeated for instance 2 divided by 2 is 1. we already have 1. 6 divided by 2 is 3. you already have 3 so you don't need to repeat that all we get is this positive negative one two three six one half and three halves what this is is a list of 12 numbers 1 and negative 1 2 and negative 2 3 negative 3 6 negative 6 and so forth and so on that contains all of the rational zeros if you have any and that is the biggest issue that students kind of get confused on they go that's all my zeros no that's a list that contains your zeros how many zeros could you possibly have in the real number system three that's it that's your degree you can only have at most three at most three not twelve that's just a list of what they are so if we know nothing about our function this gives us what is called a starting place so the starting place where you check to see if you have zeros or not so here's the process going forward and it is tedious i'm not lying to you about it and i don't want to sugarcoat it that it's easy it's not here's the process that i go through if i'm trying to find zeros the first thing i do is i check my departure real signs why because my decontroller signs might eliminate some positives or negatives so i have one positive i gotta keep the positives i have two or zero negatives okay i could have two negative x-intercepts that means that i can't eliminate anything from this list right now so then i go and i start checking values i see what which of these actually creates a zero in my function remember it's this one it's not this one check this one so i don't really want to be looking at this anymore i just want to be looking at that that's why i always teach hey go back to your original focus on doing that practice that that way you don't make a mistake and start putting values into your your negative x evaluated function so we're going to start with well what would you start with i'd start with one and if one does not evaluate and give me zero then it's not an x intercept i don't want to mess with that i just check negative one after that then i check two then negative two then three to the negative three and then six then negative six i won't check four it's not in my list or fives on my list then i'd start going to my fractions because often times especially out of textbooks um it's usually one or negative one if it's not it's some it's typically a whole number uh an integer sorry an integer a whole number integer and then you you rarely get to fractions hopefully if you do then you spend a lot of time doing that and it's kind of frustrating so that's the way that we go through this so i'm going to start by evaluating one remember the whole principle of the is called the remainder theorem and the factor theorem basically if you plug in a number and it gives you zero it's an x intercept and it creates a factor that's the whole point so we're gonna start with the easiest numbers to plug in let's start with one so i'm gonna evaluate f of one is one always going to be on your list yes yes it is because you always have a constant that's divisible by one and a coefficient that's divisible by one so one is always on your list unless it says you have no positive x intercepts and then negative one would be on your list one of those is going to be under this so let's evaluate if i plug in negative oh sorry if i plug in positive one let's see uh this would be two so two plus eleven is thirteen thirteen minus seven minus six is zero oh hey we win we win because it's convenient because they gave you an easy problem this is zero and here's what this says it says x equals one is an x-intercept that's fantastic don't check the rest of them use this one because 95 of the time what happens is if you factor out x minus 1 if you do that well then what that does is creates another polynomial that's typically factorable if not you might have to do this one more time but then what's left is almost certainly factorable like oh nearly all the examples that we work with because otherwise this takes forever to do this is too much guessing and checking so there's a lot i really want to say about this as we go through and am i going to forget about it but i'm going to sort of give you pieces of information as we go through that i really need you to glean i i need you to get that this list not all of these are x intercepts we start with the easy ones to plug in like positive one and we evaluate that and see if it equals zero if this equals zero that means that x equals one is an x-intercept it is an x-intercept for sure now pause here's one of the things i need you to get now really focus here i need you to understand this how many positive x-intercepts do we have in the entirety of this function one did we find a positive x intercept yes we found the only one that exists so what's the next numbers you would check after we do our long division if it doesn't factor the rest of time after we do that what would you check not positives not positives because you're not going to have any more that's where the cartoon of science is very important so you go hey i checked one it worked great i only had one positive x-intercept i just found it the rest of the values i would check would be negatives no more positives i don't need to do that i just found it i hope that makes sense to you i really hope that makes sense to you so we have done oh man we have our list we checked one it actually gave us zero if we checked one and it hadn't given us zero we don't ever check positive one again we go into negative one and we see if that gives us zero if that's an x intercept and then if that creates a factor so we evaluated for one it gave us zero x equals 1 is an x intercept therefore x minus 1 is a factor do you remember that if x equals 1 is an x intercept x minus 1 equals 0 that gives us a factor now what do we do with that we either choose to do long division in which case we take this polynomial and divide out x minus 1 or reduce synthetic division i'm going to really push you to synthetic division when you're dividing by linears like we are right now like x to the first power equals a constant do that it's so much faster so i'm going to go over here and i'm going to write out my original polynomial as far as the coefficients are concerned and i'm going to write out the x-intercept that i just found which is positive one the way that synthetic division works if you don't remember you should like two videos ago is you bring down your first coefficient you multiply you multiply correctly and you add you multiply and you add you multiply and you add now if you have checked this correctly and this is an x-intercept this always has to be zero if that's not zero you've either done this wrong or you've done that wrong it has to work so what this does for us is this says okay i've just divided by x to the first power basically or at least a factor that contains x to the first power i've lowered my degree by one so we already knew that x minus one is a factor for sure this positive one would create a factor that's x minus 1. but the quotient is the the the factor that's remaining that's 2x to the second power not third we reduced it by a degree positive means plus 13x and then plus 6 that's what we get now we're not done so here's your options and listen carefully this is the other piece of information i need you to understand you're not done you need to factor this completely into linears or irreducible quadratics not every quadratic is irreducible you spend an entire class in intermediate algebra basically working with quadratics and factoring the heck out of them which means that not every one of them is irreducible that's not irreducible so you have an option here's the appropriate choice as you determine what which option to pick you can either factor or you can use this list of numbers again to keep going on this polynomial so what do i mean by that you'd start by plugging in more numbers now now using everything that you just learned would you start by plugging in 1 again no but not because you found it already because you don't have any more positive x-intercepts listen very carefully this is the next piece of information i need you to get is that if you plug in one and it gave you an x-intercept you have to check to plug that in again because it could work twice wait how that's how we get multiple roots x minus one squared or three times to the third or four times to the fourth that's where multiplicity comes from is repeated roots and so you have to check it again you don't cross off your list the only time you ever cross a number off your list is one of two cases number one you exhaust your possible x entered positive or negative x intercepts then you cross off positives or negatives or if you try a number once and it doesn't work it will never work again so if i try one so like let's let's just try one because i know it's not going to work let's try it uh 2 plus 13 plus 6 that's not 0. so i know that x equals 1 is no longer an x-intercept for this part of the that function that means it's not a repeated 0. i will not be getting x minus 1 squared i hope you're following me on that so you have a choice you can either factor or you can start trying other numbers since i've exhausted all my positives i'd start with negatives they'd be like ah negative 1 maybe negative 2 negative 3 negative 6 negative 1 half negative 3 halves and i'd go in that order what's the appropriate choice factoring if you can the list if you can't or quadratic formula if you can't probably in this work factoring then quadratic formula then list that's the way i would do it so i'm going to try to factor this uh 13 and 12 hey that looks like 12 and 1 because that adds a 13 that multiplies to 12. if i use my sort of quick factoring i would divide both by a that would give us 6 over 1 and 1 over 2 and that creates two additional factors for us that's x minus one that's what we found already but then we have one x plus six and two x's plus one that's completely factored that's it now if you're thinking well wait wait a minute what about all these this list of numbers oh does this list of numbers play into this somehow check this out if i set this equal to zero and i solve it this is all of my x-intercepts x would equal one multiplicity one that's across x would equal negative six multiplicity one that's across x would equal let's see if i subtract one and divide by two that's negative one-half that's x equals negative one-half that's multiplicity one that's across wait a second here's x equals one that's on my list here's x equals negative six that's on my list here's x equals negative one half that's on my list here's one positive x intercept right there here's two negative x intercepts right there what here's degree three one two three it all needs to work you should be like math chills on that that's freaking awesome that really is cool all this stuff should work together so the long story i made sure before we go on to the next example here um is put this in order try to factor first if it does you're set you're set if it doesn't it's going to be some work due to cultural sciences see what you're working with have the degree in the back of your head then what you do create your list of potential x-intercepts hopefully you can eliminate some or at least think about what you're going to be doing if you find a positive or negative x-intercept what that means if i find a positive in this case i'm done with the rest of the positives if i find a negative in this case that means i have another one i'd have to find because you can't just have one in this particular case then what you do is once you find one x-intercept you stop you don't check anymore once you find one x-intercept you use that with synthetic division to factor it after that you kind of restart the idea you write it down and you try to factor what's left if you factor what's left you're good to go if this hadn't have worked do you realize what we would have done we would have had to check this because we would have been done with the one if you have to check more numbers you don't check it here again you check it just in this part and you start and you go okay what would i check next i wouldn't check positives unless you didn't use the cultural science and then you'd waste a lot of time i wouldn't check positives i'd check negative one you know what it's not going to work then i check negative two you know what it's not gonna work i check negative three it's not gonna work i check negative six that would be the first one that would work so i'd have to check one two three four numbers before i actually found one that would divide the rest of this polynomial that can be kind of frustrating would i honestly do that no i wouldn't what i would do is i'd factor this first if it didn't factor because it's a quadratic i'd use quadratic formula and then i would determine what my factors would be from that remember this list does not give you radicals quadratic formula will and so that would be a better way to go so i hope that makes sense i hope that i'm starting to put this in this sort of bubble that you understand that is combining the ideas of descartes and degree and factoring and rational zeros theorem and using this stuff because if you can do that together this is so effective uh like really really a lot quicker than not understanding that stuff hope makes sense going to go into the next example okay now i gave you this example for only one reason and it's to point out that my goodness you really should check factoring before you do any of this stuff please your main goal remember your goal your idea behind this is you want to factor stuff like you want to get this factorable so that we can do what we just did which is solve it for our three x intercepts multiplicity one which are all crossy that's great so we're trying to just factor stuff now this is going to give us a lot of information about um a piece of information that i haven't shown you more than twice before so we have this in order it looks good all polynomials should be especially polynomial function polynomial functions we should have in our head that this is an odd degree three odd and it's positive should look like this it should cross the x axis at least one time because it is odd we we could do the cartridge signs and say positive to positive no sign change positive negative one sign change negative to negative no sign change this has exactly one positive x-intercept for sure if we changed our odd power terms we have negative and positive that'd be negative to positive one uh positive positive no positive to negative let's see i lost track i should write it down one no two so this is it's kind of the same exact situation is here we'd have one positive for sure and either zero or two negative x-intercepts let's go ahead and see if that plays out now what i mentioned to you was that you should always try to factor things first here you do have a constant so you can't factor out just an x but look at your coefficient 3 6 negative 15 negative 30 you can factor out three i'm going to say something to you right now that's really important to understand the list of numbers that you get is not dependent on whether you factor or not here's what i mean if you get all the factors of 30 and start dividing by all the factors of 3 you're going to get the same list if you factor out the 3 first and do the list from there this has fewer factors and it's going to give you the same list do that factor if you can first i'm not lying to it every single time this is easier to find a list than that one is why they're smaller they're smaller numbers and that is actually true so that will work for you believe me now the next thing that you would would try is before you can find a list try to factor it why wouldn't we do something like grouping so if we factor out x squared from the first two terms and we factor out minus 5 or negative 5 for the last two terms we do it correctly we get x plus 2 and we get x squared minus 5 and we bring down our 3 this is a factored version of h of x now is it completely factored no now be careful this last thing i really need to talk to you about before we move on and really start getting into rational zeros there are some pretty hectic polynomials this is not completely factory wait a minute that's not a difference of squares that's a quadratic that's an irreducible quadratic because i can't factor it no no it's it is a reducible quadratic because you can factor it had this been x plus five yeah you'd be done that's that's irreducible that's not a difference of squares but there's something i brought up twice before that even if you don't have a perfect square here you can factor this i'm going to show you right now i know that if i gave this to you you all would say yeah you can factor that that's x minus five and x plus five but how did you get it you got it by saying okay what i really do is i take the square root of x and i put it here and i take the square root of 25 and i put it here that's where that comes from and you see oh that's x minus 5 and x plus 5 because the square root of 25 is 5 and so you have plus and minus 5. you do the same thing with things that aren't perfect squares so with x squared minus 5 we're going to repeat this process we're going to say oh hey x squared minus 5 can i treat that like a difference of squares yes x minus the square root of 5 and x plus the square root of 5. and if you want to look at it this is x squared plus x root 5 minus x root 5 and then minus square root of 5 times square root of 5 is 5 minus 5. it's the same exact thing i need you to be able to factor that so this is not your additional quadratic this does give us x-intercepts and this is completely factored how do we know that well they're all linear that's the power 1 power 1 and power one you cannot factor linears any more than a gcf which we've already took care of so you're done so let's see if this beared out to the cartridge rule of signs and then we'll find the list of numbers we're gonna do it anyway just so you can see what i was talking about as far as these not being on it so what are x intercepts well we have by the zero product property three little equations it would say x equals negative two and the square root of five and the negative square root of five wait a second that's one sign change one positive two sine when we did the issue of negative x that was two sine changes that was two or zero here's our one positive x intercept here's our two negative x intercepts interesting now what about the list had you done this by the list that p over q the p's would have been factors of 10 negative 10 but it doesn't really matter so you get 1 and 10 and 2 and 5. for our cues you would just get one that does my factor of one is plus and minus one so basically one over one two over one five over one ten over one gives you this list of numbers again if we had had to check this we'd start with one it wouldn't have worked we would have tried negative one because we knew we had a positive x intercept and we possibly had negatives so you would try your negatives you try one and negative one then you try two then you get to negative two and that would have finally worked then you would have factored that out then you would end up with this this is exactly what you would have had you might have a fraction here but this is exactly what you would have over here you'd have x squared minus 5. now check it out if you try any of these numbers you know what it's not going to work in there why because this list does not contain square roots do you see it we have two x-intercepts that are square roots it's not here it would never will be there that's why it's so important for you to understand how to factor this or to use quadratic formula because your quadratic formula will factor all of the quadratics that you get so if it's reducible quadratic formula if it's not quadratic formula will show you that it's kind of a nice little trick of difference of squares great use it but do not count on this list to give you everything it gives you a starting spot it can give you two starting spots if you have to use it twice that's fine but at some point when you get quadratics at the end then you need something beyond that and that would be factorization like this or quadratic formula i hope that makes sense i hope you see what i'm talking about put in order due to cultural signs but certainly try to factor it's going to save you a ton of time like it did right here and that factoring is uh much more relevant when our list is exhausted and we can't we can't use it for anything else so i'm going to come back with a few more examples we're going to start getting into it it's going to take a little while but i'm gonna show you um some pretty cool stuff all right here we go uh that's a long problem and it's gonna take us a while uh there's something you probably know about me that i do not like to shy away from the hard problems why because that happened to me when i was going through school i'd have these these professors who would just give the idea and a really easy problem to go i'm gonna do it i'd run that and go this doesn't look anything like what we did in class and it was very frustrating so i sometimes get comments like your videos are too long i understand that but i'm also trying to get you to see the main things and and not shy away from doing hard stuff so that you are able to and you gain some confidence in it so that you can because you can you are able to do this stuff it's not all that bad but you do need to see it right in order to be able to uh to learn from it so here it is this is the second longest example that we're probably going to do in this class because it takes a long time to do we're going to walk through everything like descartes will assign how it works with this example why we would use it here we're going to come with our list of numbers because i cannot factor that neither can you because it's degree five and there's no general way to do it we need to know an x-intercept in order to factor them so we'll talk about that uh we're going to go through and uh and use synthetic division twice and the the final quotient that we get there is going to be factorable so we're going to do everything that i'd expect you to be able to do like on a test or something so let's take a look g of x the first thing to check is is it order and it is looks really good in your head you'd say that's a degree five that's a positive degree five that's an odd power function the end behavior looks like this and you are going to cross the x-axis because all odds with at least a power function leading term of 5 is going to have degree 5 is going to have that so we think this is degree 5 it's odd looks like this it's gonna cross at least one time next thing we'd say is that is degree five i can have at most five x intercepts at most i will have no more than that do i have to have all five no those things should run in your head every time you interact with one of these problems the next thing we would try to do is we would try to factor it so we'd say hey is there a gcf nope uh is there like an x or a number i could factor out no can i use grouping now there's too many terms there's uh one two three four six terms i can only group four terms can i do quadratic formula or no it's not quadratic so we're out of options the only thing we can do at this point is find an x-intercept so the way we start that is with descartes rule of signs to see what our list of numbers uh or well to see how we can use our listed list of numbers appropriately that we're about to get so to cartridge the signs we start by just counting the number of sign changes let's see one two three four there's five sign changes what that means is there will be five four three four one x positive x intercepts five or three or one y pairs of two or why subtract two well because complex solutions from irreducible quadratics always come in pairs always so um if i have one complex i have another if i have an irreducible quadratic that's a power two so we would have five x-intercepts positive x-intercepts if we have no negatives and no irreducible quadratic factors we have all five but what if we have an irreducible quadratic well then we'd have three and then what if we had another one then we'd have one that's it so we know there's at least one positive there could be three that could be five positive x-intercepts now we're going to evaluate this for negative x essentially what that does just change the signs of your odd power terms don't change the evens don't change the constants so negative don't change the evens minus 19x cubed don't change evens minus 60x don't change the constants and do the same thing so how many sine chains do we have uh no no no no zero zero sign changes when you evaluated for negative x that means there are zero negative x intercepts so if i don't have positives i don't have the x-intercepts that also means one more thing when we do the list of rational potential rational zeros that we get we don't have to do any negatives yay why because you know there's not any that's why descartes will assign is very important because that eliminates half of your list of numbers that's fantastic that's going to save you so much time so now we do is we take our constant from our original we don't have to look at this anymore we don't really want it we're going to take our constant and our leading coefficient that's 36 don't even worry about the negative it doesn't really matter as far as finding your factors you're going to pick positive factors anyway right because you don't have any negatives so you're just going to pick positive factors of 36 and 1. so our p is 1 and 36 2 and 18 3 and 12 ran out of space four and nine and then six one thirty six two and eighteen three and twelve uh all of those pairs multiply 36 and then six is the last 6 times 6 we want to list it twice why i'm not including negatives here is because the cultural signs told us we will have no negative x-intercepts we don't have to worry about it the negative divided by negative if you thought about that would give you positive anyway as far as our q well that's coming from one we don't need the positive or negative again for the same reason but our coefficient's one there's only one factor one it's one so our list of p's over q is just this list of numbers again it's just that list of numbers again so we have 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 and 36 for the last time this is all these are all the potential rational x-intercepts that we could have for that function now we already know there's at most five of them and they'd all be positive so there's at most five or maybe three or one positive x-intercept that would be on this list why do we have negatives it says we don't have any so we don't check things that we don't have why do that that's a waste of time that's why the cartoon signs is used for for that and the other reason that if you had one you know you don't check them again if you had one or three and you found two you'd have another one so that that's why we do it to to guide where we focus our attention that's what it's mainly used for now we all obviously know that not all these work because we have at most five so that's that's something interesting to know as well so where do we start once we've done all of this stuff and we have our potential list of numbers no natives don't have any start with one and just plug it in see if it works so let's evaluate let's evaluate g of 1. so when we evaluate g of 1 we plug it into this so we evaluate it there one minus seven let's see that's uh that's negative six plus 19 is 13 minus 37 is negative 24 plus 60 is 36 36 minus 36 is zero hey look it works zero now what's that mean what that mean and by the way uh lots of teachers i've seen make it so that's either one or negative one and at most like two or three something like that rarely do you get to 36 uh so just keep that in mind check the small numbers it's probably going to be one of the first couple that's not you had to cheat at your test uh so anyway what that means is that if i evaluated for x equals one and x equals one equals zero when i evaluate it that means x equals one is an x-intercept this graph is going to hit x equals one on the x-axis hey that's positive look at that it works we have no negatives anyway it's gotta be what that also means is that x minus one because x equals one would yield x minus one equals zero x minus one is a factor so now you have a choice to make you have to divide you have no other way to factor besides using long division of this polynomial that point by that factor or doing synthetic division which gives us the same result so you pick whichever one is fine it doesn't really matter i'm going to do synthetic because it's way faster and because we're dealing with linears for quadratics we have to do long division i'll refer to that when we get there but for right now man let's do synthetic division so synthetic division takes this polynomial as far as the coefficients are concerned and and uses one not negative one that's a real big point of confusion for a lot of students with long division you use the whole factor x minus one with synthetic you use one the x-intercept and one so we bring down the first coefficient we multiply and we add we multiply and we add we multiply and we add we multiply and we add we multiply and we add and that last value is your remainder you must end with a remainder of zero or you have made a mistake somewhere either that's not an x-intercept you messed up in your evaluation or you did that wrong probably the evaluation because sometimes it can get pretty tricky especially when you're not just plugging in one but like negative one-half that can happen a lot so what's that mean what that means is that this right here represents the quotient upon division by this factor of that polynomial in other words it says that we already knew that we got one factor x minus one by the way i'm about to rewrite this polynomial as a semi factor form do that every time please do that every time i've seen a lot of teachers even say well now just find another number and do this again well you start losing track of your factors that way so every time we do a division you're going to write the factors so the factor is x minus some of you right now are like no i'm not can't make me you're right i can't make you but it's a good idea so x minus one not x plus one that's why we do it to focus on the factor that we just factored out because i've seen x plus one too many times with other method uh then x to the fourth minus six x to the third plus 13 x squared and so forth and the reason why i want you to do this part of it because you know what's there right you know you know that is so that you can evaluate the rest of your list now listen carefully please the same list that you used for this will work for this don't recreate your list you don't have to that's way too much work you don't have to this is the list for the polynomial it's all of them so don't redo it in fact if you look you're going to get the same exact values don't redo it also make sure you check the number the last number that you were that worked that came out bad but here's what i what i mean by it so if we checked one and it worked you need to check it again over here it very well might work that would give you x minus one to the second power a repeated factor a repeated zero so you you don't just it's not one and done you always check it until it doesn't work now on the on the other hand if you check one and it doesn't work don't bother checking it here because it won't work ever so once you exhaust a number it never comes back into play if you use a number and it gives you a zero it might be another zero it might be a repeated zero so you have to check it so once we factored once we go okay can i factor this with another technique can i do grouping uh no no i can't does it factor in either way no it doesn't refer back to your list and try the last number that worked so try one all right well how about one uh one minus six that's negative five plus thirteen that's um eight minus twenty four that's no no that's not going to work that doesn't give me zero so i know that one is off the table so i'm going to cross that off my list one is no longer going to work for us i tried two i've already done this so two does not work for us but you would try it you say okay plug in two two to the fourth power 16 minus 6 times 8 plus 13 times 4 minus 24 times 2 plus 36 and it's not going to give you zero so you would say hey this if i evaluate for 2 kind of g it's not really g but g ish is not going to give me zero that's not going to work so let's say all right two doesn't work crossed off my list i try three g of 3 this isn't going to be 0 but if i plug in 3 here this actually is you might want to try it take your calculator out and evaluate this part of it for 3. it is going to give you zero and since this if i evaluate three is zero zero times two if you evaluate three is still going to be zero so g of three does give you zero g of 2 did not that's why we crossed it off g of 3 does and so we're going to say all right since g of 3 is 0 i am now going to say two things about it i'm going to say that x equals 3 is another x-intercept because when i evaluate it it gave us 0 that's what x-intercepts do and therefore x minus 3 is another one of our factors so i always do that every time i say what the x-intercept is i say what the factor is because when i continue to factor this i will have a factor of x minus 1 and then i'll also have a factor of x minus 3 not x plus three x minus three and then we do synthetic division again so we take the quotient from our last synthetic division and we use our x-intercept that would be positive three remember all of our x-intercepts have to be positive oh wait here's a good check for understanding see if you understand this because i found let's see one positive x-intercept and i just found another one that's two positive x-intercepts are there necessarily at least one more and you should be not a yes because i know i have one or three not two so i found one of them i found another one of them there's gotta be at least one more maybe even three more could be and then we do our synthetic division so bring down your first coefficient multiply and add multiply and add multiply and add multiply and add and you must get a zero and here's what it says our g of x is now factored as we had an x minus 1 factor we now have an x minus 3 not plus 3 and the resultant factor that we get this quotient here says remember i used reduce my power again this is the other reason why we write this out every time so you can keep track of your degree of that factor now we'd say this is 1x to the third minus 3x squared plus 4x minus 12. so what now what would you do now well you do one of two things you'd start over with your list now i'm gonna go through that right now so you see what you would do would you have to check one here no because you tried it here and it didn't work would you check 2 again no because you tried here it didn't work would you try 3 again yes you would it's not going to work but you would it might work actually you try 3 again and if it works you'd factor out again what would i do before that though i would try to factor the remaining polynomials so i would try to factor this by grouping if we factor out x squared and four we get x minus three and x squared plus four i'm gonna talk i gotta talk about that i gotta show you i gotta show you um i'm gonna write down the the result of this because this is what we're gonna be ending with but i really need to talk about this for a second so if we factor that we go okay we had one factor of x minus one one factor of x minus three check this out this is what i want to talk about we factored another factor we got x minus 3. get the same factor twice what do you do with that well you should write it as x minus 3 squared that's repeated 0. here's what this says what this says is that if i tried one here no it wouldn't work if i tried two here no it wouldn't work if i evaluated for three here yes it would have worked so let's see three cubed is 27 minus 27 is zero plus 4 times 3 is 12 minus 12 is 0. oh that's an x-intercept that would say that g of 3 gives me 0 again x equals 3 is a fact is a x-intercept again x minus three equals zero again for this part of the polynomial x minus three would be another factor and if we had done synthetic division yet again with uh one negative three four and negative twelve thank goodness is fast and i i used my positive three x-intercept again that we know is gonna work one three zero zero four twelve zero bring it down multiply add multiply add multiply add and you get x squared plus zero x plus four that's where that factor comes from this is the reason that you don't just check once and you're done we checked one it worked we checked again it didn't work then we're done check two it didn't work it's never gonna work check three it worked we used it it worked again we used it again that's why we don't just check it once and and say we're done with it because it can possibly give us another factor so what's that mean what's it mean well we look at it and go this is that's linear that's linear that's linear can you factor x squared plus 4 x squared plus a number no that's an irreducible quadratic even quadratic formula here would show us that our discriminant is negative saying you don't have any x-intercepts this is going to be a complex solution that power 2 is the reason why we have 3 and not 5 positive x-intercepts that degree is 5. we could potentially have 5 but this screws it up this power 2 takes away 2 and says ah that's going to be complex so i have 1 2 3. i kinda have i really only have two um but one of them is repeated that's giving us a balance so the way we write this completely factored into linears and irreducible quadratics is like that and here's what it says x equals 1 is an x-intercept and it's a crossy due to that multiplicity 1. cross c's not really a math word it's just my word we have another one at x equals three and that's a bouncy due to the multiplicity of two that would be that even multiplicity so we cross at one come back down bounce at three and have still this sort of end behavior what we don't do is we don't have any additional x-intercepts so we have three x-intercepts they're both positive one of them is repeated though so that kind of wraps it up into this bounce instead of a two crosses so i hope that you're with me on that one i'm going to come back with one last example we're going to do it twice because i want to show you two different approaches to it so that you can see that the way in which you pick some of these some of these numbers to choose can impact uh the amount of work you have to do so i'll show you that in just a minute all right let's get into the last example i know i have it written twice because we're going to do it two different ways so i can show you the choice actually matters not that your process really should change but just that it matters um as far as what you're checking in your evaluation for your rational zeros theorem or rational roots theorem so we're going to do the whole thing but i'm going to be pretty quick about it we're going to do cartoon signs we're going to get our list but we're going to pretty much fly through the rest of it so here's the deal the first thing we check every time is order then we get an idea of degree and end behavior this is in order and the end behavior is going to be a positive odd like most of the ones we've done today in this video then we're going to check the cultural signs and see what we're working with so the cartridge sign says 1 two three no four sign changes so we have four sign changes here that's going to be four or two or zero positive x-intercept intercepts we change our odd powered terms by evaluating with negative x so change this one leave this one change this one leave this one change this one leave that one that would be no sign chain one sign change and then not another one so that's going to be one negative x intercept hundred percent guaranteed we have one and only one negative x-intercept we could have zero or we could have two or we could have four positives now does that make sense yeah degrees five we have at most five x-intercepts in total we have at most four plus one that would be five total are we going to get all 5 no we're not because i designed the problem that way but we could get 5 potentially i think we get 3. so anyhow we use that though to limit our our work so we know we're going to have a negative we're going to have to check negatives we know we might have positives we're going to check positives on the list of p's over q's that we're going to get right now so the next thing we do because we're in order we look at our constant term and we start factoring it so our list of factors for 25 1 and 25 let's see two doesn't work three no four no five yes but that's it so 1 5 and 25 both positive and negative for our cues we have just one and two because two that coefficient has just two factors prime number so p is over q we take one over one five over one twenty-five over one we'd also take one over two five over two and twenty-five over two none of which simplify it this is very rare that that happens most of the time we get something to simplify so we have one two three times two is six one two three four five six you should have six expressions of fractions or whole numbers before you start simplifying you can't eliminate some of those but here we can't do that so we have a list of numbers that are the potential this contains all of the rational x-intercepts for that function now are all of them x-intercepts no we know there's at most five but if they're if we have any rational x-intercepts they're there do you have to have rational x-intercepts no you don't like x squared plus 5 is a parabola that floats above the x axis it's a degree is 2 but it has no x intercepts so what that means is that this does not include any square root x intercepts or any complex intercepts that we might have so just keep that in mind it's just a starting spot for us okay so what do we check first well the first thing we're gonna do is reject one that that's where we always start if we have any positive x intercepts or potential positive x intercepts we check one so let's try that if we evaluate for one let's see that's two uh two minus one that's one one plus 48 is 49 49 minus 24 is 25 25 minus 50 is negative 25 and negative 25 plus 25 0. hey that worked good that means that x equals 1 is an x-intercept that also means that x minus 1 is a factor so you kind of a choice right now you choose to either use x minus 1 and do long division of polynomial or you choose positive 1 and do synthetic division we're going to choose that so the way this works we tried one it worked as if x is an x-intercept we know that that's an x-intercept this is the coefficients of our polynomial we bring down the first one we multiply we add we multiply we add multiply and add multiply and add multiply and you must get zero there if you don't something went wrong and we're also gonna do one more thing we know that we have a factor of x minus one not x plus one oh man x minus one now we have this resultant polynomial as a factor and we reduced it by one degree so what's the next step well the next step is you try to factor that that's a degree for we're not going to factor it but we would try it so well there's no gcf there's nothing i really do there's no grouping no general formula that i know no quadratic formula if that had been a power two and you didn't see the factorization you just do quadratic and you end with a rash a radical zero that would not be on that list so what we do now is hopefully you know you start back with your list now should we check one again yes we should we should try one again so try one uh two plus one well i can tell you right now that all of these numbers are way more than twenty-five so two plus one plus forty-nine plus twenty-five minus twenty-five and that's not gonna be zero so one worked once but it's not going to work again we never tried positive 1 again for this problem should we try negative 1 yes we should because we potentially or we definitely have at least one negative x intercept now i don't know if it's negative 1 but we would try it so we evaluate for negative one and all we have to do is evaluate here it's not going to be zero here it doesn't matter evaluate here so with negative one that would be 2 minus 1 that's 1 plus 49 is 50 minus 25 is 25 minus 25 is 0. so x equals negative 1 that's great that's another x-intercept that means x plus 1 is another factor again long division or synthetic division and we're just using this part of our polynomial now and we're using negative one be careful with synthetic you have to use the x-intercept so we're gonna bring down the first coefficient we're gonna multiply and add multiply and add multiply and add multiply appropriate remember negative 1 times negative 25 is positive 25 and add hey that looks great and that gives us another factoring so we keep on writing this every time we write the entire polynomial we had an x minus one we just gained a factor of x plus one and now we have reduced the power one more time now what should you do should you go back to your list you can if you don't see how to factor it you can you would not try one you would try negative one again it's not going to work well i don't think it's going to work we should try it though uh so 2 let's see that would be negative 2 minus 1 is negative 3 minus 50 remember trying negative 1 again that's negative 53 no it's not going to work there's no way that's going to give us a zero but you try it so negative one wouldn't work you'd try five next and then if that didn't work negative five then you tried 25 that didn't work negative 25 then you'd go to your fractions the better idea is to see if you can factor that so if we try to factor by grouping that works that's great would that mean if you do it right that's great now i'm a double check so 2x to the third minus x squared this would be 50x minus 25. if we continue to factor that that's 2x minus 1 and then x squared plus 25. so what's that mean that means that we have factored this as x minus 1 x plus one two x minus one and x squared plus twenty five let's see if this matches what we thought would happen this factor would give us a positive x-intercept at multiplicity one that'd be across at x equals one this would be a negative one that's across the at x equals negative one that's our one negative x-intercept there can be no more this would be positive one-half add one divided by two positive one-half so a crossing and a crossing those are our two positive x-intercepts there's zero there's not zero there would have to be two or four here's one here's another one here's our one negative can you simplify that anymore no that's an irreducible quadratic that right there would be complex solutions we get to in the next video what if it had been negative what if it had been x squared minus 25 then you would factor that again and you would get x minus five and x plus five now by doing that you change some of these signs and this would no longer hold true but that's what would happen so if that was the case then you'd continue to factor it you have x minus 5 and you have x plus 5. i hope that makes sense you hope you're seeing i'm going to change it back but i want to reference that so that would be completely factored over linears and irreducible quadratics we have one two three x-intercepts and it fits what the cartridge sign says about that now let's do the last this example again but do it sort of differently i've never shown that i've never really seen a lot of people show how to do synthetic division with fractions so i'm going to show you that it actually works i'm going to leave that and believe it for one reason i believe it for that reason you see i know that that's an x-intercept and i'm going to show you with synthetic division that you can divide that out and get this the same thing and in fact it's a lot quicker so i'm going to show you that and i'm also going to show you that you might get a different look for your solution so let's say that we uh we somehow know that there's an x-intercept of one-half can you do synthetic division with one half the answer is yes now here's the deal that factor you would have to solve for one half to be able to do it remember synthetic division does not work if your factor has a 2 in front of it so what you'd have to do is say hey 2x minus 1 equals 0 add your 1 divided by your 2 x is one half that's what you would use there to factor this out that's what you have to do so here's how it works we bring down our first coefficient cool we'd multiply two times one-half is one then you add wait negative one plus one is zero that's okay one half times zero is zero then you'd add that's 48 one half times 48 is 24 then you add negative 24 plus 24 is zero that's okay one half times zero is zero you add that's negative 50 one half times negative 50 is negative 25 and sure enough you get zero just be careful what your exponents are you see what this does is this says that this factor is x minus one half notice that this factor is now x minus one half would equal zero can you have two different ways to represent the same factor yes two x minus one and x minus one half is identical it doesn't matter so this represents the factor as x minus whatever your x intercept is and this one doesn't who cares it doesn't who cares it does not matter what does matter is we get our exponents right so this would be 2x to the fourth we reduce by 1. 0x cubed don't write it 48x squared cool minus 50. now i'm going to show you what the difference would be between these these results here it is if you continue to factor the first thing you do is you would try to factor that what factors oh wait a minute 2 2 and 2 go into all three of those terms factor the 2 out and where we put it is all the way in the front so you'd have a 2 you'd still have a factor of x minus one half but when you factor out that 2 and you put it here you get x to the fourth 24 x squared minus 25. now can you factor this yeah that's a very special form of a quartic you could do a substitution if you want you could say hey let's call u equals x squared and you do u squared plus 24u minus 25 you could just straight up say hey that's a three term polynomial and i know that factors as negative 1 and 25 that adds to 24 that multiplies the negative 25 and because i'm familiar with my exponents i know that we can put this as 2 x minus one half and then x squared minus 1 and x squared plus 25. you could show grouping with that you could do anything you want we've covered all of those things before and you can see it works x to the fourth uh 25x squared minus 1 is 24x squared minus 25. that doesn't factor that's an irreducible quadratic this one does factor that's a difference of squares now here's the question do you get the same x-intercepts well that gives you one that gives you negative one there's those that gives you positive one-half there's that that's the same reducible quadratic why do they look different they look different because we sort of forced a factoring out of two and if you force this to factor out two you get the same thing or if you distributed this so that you don't get fractions when you distribute a factor like that you don't do it everywhere you do it just to one of those factors this would give us 2x minus 1 for that particular factor it's the same thing so which way is better honestly getting to the one half would have been just a random guess so you'd go through like i showed you on the first example but i do want to tell you that choosing a factor can have a bearing on your later factor ability like whether it's easier whether you have to pick another number from a list so i want to make sure you understand that uh last thing i wanted to say is please please don't forget that if this hadn't been x minus 1 but like x minus 7 x squared minus seven that that is technically still factorable that would be x minus the square root of seven times x plus the square root of seven that would be square root of seven and square root of seven so keep that in mind this is not an irreducible quadratic okay i know that's a very long video i hope it made sense i hope that in but you need to see it all at once um hope that you followed it and i hope that you are ready because we we're basically done with everything you need to know about polynomials you know how to graph them you now know how to factor them so that you can find x intercepts with multiplicities all crosses so that you can factor it the next thing we're doing is talking about complex and then we get into graphing with rationals so i hope you're following me i'll see you for another video
