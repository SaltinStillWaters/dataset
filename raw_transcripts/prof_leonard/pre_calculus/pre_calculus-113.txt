Transcript for: How to Convert From Polar Equations to Rectangular Equations (Precalculus - Trigonometry 40)
hey there we're going to talk about one more thing before we start graphing some of these polar equations we're going to talk about how to convert from polar equations into rectangular sometimes it's very valuable to get a better picture of what we're dealing with when we're not too familiar with this sometimes it's nice because they're easier and rectangular sometimes they're not but we want to practice to be prepared when they are so here's the deal this is the same exact thing that we're dealing with from the last video we have x squared plus y squared equals r squared we have x equals r cosine theta and y equals r sine theta we're just going to be going in the reverse order if you remember from the last video every time we saw x squared plus y squared we replace this with r squared every time we saw x or y by themselves we replaced it with the appropriate r cosine theta for x or r sine theta for y now we're going backwards whenever we see r squared we can replace that with x squared plus y squared or r cosine theta with x or sine theta with y that's really the three things that we can do to replace polar coordinates with rectangular coordinates we're just replacing the pieces individually there's also one additional helpful hint that you need to know we can always multiply both sides of a polar equation by r that's really helpful especially when we take a look at something like the first couple examples when we look at r cosine theta i don't see an r squared i don't see an r cosine theta i don't see r sine theta i see r equals cosine theta if i subtract it doesn't help if i divide it doesn't help this is really not very doable right now for us so what's allowed is we can multiply both sides of this equation by r now do you see what's going to help us with that if we multiply both sides by r on the left hand side we get r squared on the right hand side we get r cosine theta now this is super nice because we see right here hey r squared is equal to x squared plus y squared whenever we saw x over y squared we were able to replace it with r squared now the reverse is true when you see r squared we can certainly replace that with x squared plus y squared and we've just converted this piece of our polar equation into something that's rectangular now r cosine theta that is x so we can replace that piece with x this is oftentimes a really good first thing to do is if you don't see any sort of r squared or any r cosine r sine theta we we can multiply both sides of that equation by r and ultimately get an r squared at least somewhere and typically in either an x or y or both so that's something that's very nice now we're practically done you can subtract x on both sides if you'd like to get this equal to zero that's okay you could factor but it doesn't make it necessarily any any better so this is actually fine for us we've once we've done this we've converted from polar equation into rectangular equation okay let's move on so we have r equals sine theta plus one i do not see r squared i do not see r sine theta all i see is an r on one side a sine theta plus one the other notice how we're missing a couple pieces we either want that we want that to be r squared we want that to be r sine theta we're missing r let's multiply both sides by r however when you do that don't forget that you have to multiply an entire side by something so when we multiply this side by r we really are multiplying that whole side by r it will have to distribute so that's r squared here no problem but r sine theta plus r we're going to have to deal with that r on the left hand side oh we see it we see x squared plus y squared it's wrapped up in r squared but the pythagorean theorem says that this is x squared plus y squared likewise our trigonometry says that we have r sine theta equals y now the plus r how in the world are we going to deal with a plus r we don't want to go multiplying both sides by r again because we're just going to get r here and r there and that's going to be very annoying so what do you do you can use this to solve for r but how would we do it well if r squared equals x squared plus y squared what if we just take a square root of both sides keep r positive like we're used to doing then r would equal the square root of x squared plus y squared so that's something that we can do when we run into a bind if you've exhausted all of your r squareds all of your your sines and cosines our sine are cosines with x's and y's and you still have a r hanging out solve that for r and then you can replace it so if r squared is x squared plus y squared then of course r is the square root of that that's really it besides moving terms around we're done there's not a whole lot of simplifying we can do we're just about there now which one looks better this rectangular equation or the original polar probably the polar probably easier to deal with as well let's move on to the next one so r squared equals cosine theta the first temptation might be to replace that with x squared plus y squared and we're going to however notice that we're missing something over here we're missing that r so so what do you do do you replace this with x squared plus y squared or do you multiply both sides by r there are two options here number one i'm i'm going to multiply both sides by r but what i'm not gonna do i'm not gonna make this r cubed i'm gonna leave this as r squared times r and the reason why is i'm gonna be able to replace the r squared with x squared plus y squared but i'll replace the r next to it with that piece and that's kind of nice so on the left hand side i'm seeing my r squared times my r i don't want to do r cubed for the reasons i just said on the right hand side though i multiplied by r so the right hand side would be nice because r cosine theta is exactly x so i'm going to replace that we're going to convert it right now from polar into rectangular r cosine theta is x r squared is x squared plus y squared now because we're multiplying by something else you have to have parentheses r is just hey we've done that the square root of x squared plus y squared now that might look a little nasty but keep in mind that these are exponents we really have x squared plus y squared to the first power if you remember square roots x squared plus y squared to the one-half power because we can combine these common bases by adding exponents we have two halves plus one half that's three halves that is about as good as i want to make that there's not a whole lot of other simplification that we can do now i did say you had two options what if you didn't see that what if you didn't want to multiply both sides by by r could you get the same thing yes you can but you deal with the denominator so what if i do this a different way and say leonard you told me every time i see r squared to replace it with x squared plus y squared yeah and i actually did that what if i replace it now it's not really a big deal this would be x squared plus y squared what the world are you going to do with that the same logic applies to what we did with our r r squared was x squared plus y squared so r we could take a square root x is r cosine theta so what's cosine theta well it's x over r oh yeah i can solve for cosine theta that's actually just the trigonometric identity for a unit circle so x over r so could you replace cosine theta with x over r yeah of course they're equivalent now that's all well and good for the x but do you notice that this still has a polar piece to it it's about the r you have to take care of that how we can do it that's where that comes in again so in using this the reason why a lot of people don't like to do that is because you get this r on a denominator and you have this square root because x over r you cannot leave that r that's still polar you need all rectangular so we'd have to go and say hey the same way we replace r with square root of x squared plus y squared we're going to do that here as well we'll replace that with the square root of x squared plus y squared and lastly that's an equation but we really don't like denominators especially with square roots let's multiply both sides by the square root of x squared plus y squared if we do we get precisely the same thing we had right there it will work out to exactly the same expression does it matter which one you use no not really as long as you're doing valid operations using valid identities that we've already determined you're going to be fine the one thing that you can do here without worrying about it is multiplying both sides of your equation by r that's good that's okay it allows you to do other things with this so i hope you're seeing that i hope it makes sense we're going to come back with just like two more examples and then be done let's continue with these three they're kind of tricky and then we'll do two easier ones really so let's take a look at r equals sine theta over cosine squared theta what in the world are we going to do with that sometimes it helps to see if there's an identity within there so before we start multiplying things by r if it looks really really crazy i don't know what to do with that let's let's start to see if we can do that so maybe i'm going to write this as sine theta over cosine theta times cosine theta now why would we want to do that well because i'm seeing sine over cosine looks like tangent and tangent is y over x now with the one over cosine theta i don't like fractions with things in the denominator like cosine theta or r so constants are okay but let's get rid of that let's multiply both sides by cosine theta why i'm doing that is i want to avoid multiplying by r right now because there's not a great place to put it an r squared be great here but not necessarily over here so i want to get rid of those fractions before i do that on the left hand side we're going to get r cosine theta that's a beautiful thing on the right hand side we get tangent theta now remember about tangent theta tangent theta is by definition by the identity y over x r cosine theta well that is x if we multiply both sides by x we're going to get x squared equals y or just y equals x squared so this whole thing that whole thing works out to be just a basic parabola interesting so i give to you hopefully find that interesting are there other ways to go about it yeah there are there are if you if you saw this right from the beginning if you multiply both sides by r cosine squared theta equals sine theta now you can multiply both sides by r that'd be fantastic because you'll get r squared equals r sine theta instead of replacing which is why i gave you the first way instead of replacing that with x squared plus y squared which is what i see a lot of please think through this if this is r squared times cosine squared theta then this is r cosine theta quantity squared means this is x squared you don't have to go through all that mess don't replace just these little p t pieces replace this after you've really factored it shown this as something to the second power this is x squared equals that's y and then you're done either way works i just wanted to give you options for that let's talk about the next one so r equals 3 cosecant theta when you see those those functions those reciprocal functions change them so because cosecant theta is one over sine theta we can write this as three over sine theta now we're going to go through the same process let's multiply both sides by sine theta before you start multiplying by r get rid of those fractions typically that works really well so we get r sine theta equals three you're done no multiplying by r no nothing r sine theta is y so we get this horizontal line at 3. that's exactly what that is telling you there what if it had been what r equals 3 secant theta that would in one over cosine multiply by cosine you would have got a vertical line at three so cosecant would relate to a horizontal line secant would relate to a vertical line because of the x and the y relationships that we we've learned for sine and cosine and cosecant secant okay last one r equals sine theta cosine squared theta now we don't have any fractions so we there's nothing get rid of and we're really lacking a lot here i see no r sine theta r cosine theta i see no r squared well wait a second if i can multiply both sides of the equation by r can i multiply it by more than that can i multiply it by as many r's as it would take to create y x and x maybe i multiply this by three r's or r cubed on the left hand side we're going to get r to the fourth power on the right hand side yeah i have r cubed but remember why we did it what we want to do is we want to create y and x how do i do that well i want to make sure that i have an r next to a sine an r next to a cosine or an r squared next to a cosine squared and use exactly what we've done here so i'm trying to create x and y because that's what sine and cosine are trying to give me they just don't have enough r's to do it so i'm making that happen for it so i'm going to do r sine theta that's used up one of my r's i still have r squared left if you wanted to write that as cosine times cosine and put an r for each one that's perfectly appropriate as well on the left hand side i'm also thinking ahead i don't have anything that says r to the fourth but i do have something that says r to the second so what if i wrote this as r squared squared the r sine theta looks really nice that's y this looks a little bit funny so i'm going to make this r times cosine theta quantity squared that's x squared this r squared says hey r squared whenever you see that is x squared plus y squared quantity squared on the right hand side this is y this is x squared and if we take a square root of both sides then what we end up getting is a square root is going to cancel the power 2. you're going to get x squared plus y squared on the right hand side yeah the square root will cancel out that power too but not the y's so remember with with these one-half powers these square roots you can distribute across multiplication and division because of that we'll get x but we have to keep the square root of y that's about as good as we can make that so i know that we're very quick hopefully that makes sense though on on how we deal with some of these more difficult polar equations that don't look readily doable or readily convertible into rectangular we're really looking for not not a trick but getting rid of fractions is oftentimes very helpful whether you do it first or whether you see an identity which i've showed you both ways to solve that that's fine you can have the same thing here change those reciprocal functions into trig functions right away typically right away so that you can see what's really going on then we get rid of fractions and some identities are right there for us which is very nice otherwise if you don't see anything happening right away and you you see missing pieces like hey sign usually needs an r i know i can multiply just give it enough r's to satisfy what it wants to give in the first place which is y's and x's so hopefully i've walked you through those we're coming back with just a few more examples they will be quick and then we'll be done okay last two so first one r equals two i'm giving this example even though it looks pretty easy and it's not too bad to illustrate what this is because we're about to move on to graphing these please think about what r equals 2 actually means if you had a radius of 2 no matter what the angle was based on some pole some origin what would it create it would create a circle with a radius of two now notice what we're going to get out of this we're going to convert this to rectangular for sure because right now it's in polar it's in terms of r and theta but when we convert it it's going to be exactly the same form of an equation for a conic section that we call a circle now how would you do it well because r is equal to 2 i don't see r squared i don't even see a sine or cosine anywhere we could multiply both sides by r but it might be nice to square both sides if we do on the left hand side we get r squared on the right hand side we get 4 but now we see r squared r squared is x squared plus y squared let's substitute that if x if x squared plus y squared equals 4 that is a circle centered at the origin it's not shifted left it's not shifted right it's not just shifted up or down it has a radius of the square root of that number this is a circle centered at the origin with a radius of the square root of four or two exactly what that says now which one's nicer depends on what you're doing really if you're used to rectangular coordinates and rectangular equations that's easier but like physically like looking at this physically that's an easier equation it's just it's a constant if the radius is a constant that's a circle it's exactly what circle is something with a constant radius nothing that's changing okay last one that looks a little crazy because we have this denominator so a couple things that we're going to do number one thing that we're going to do is we're going to get rid of that fraction in doing so we cancel out our denominator here and we have to distribute that's r minus r cosine theta equals 4. now what in the world do we do here the first thing you might see is maybe i should multiply both sides by r if we do that you're going to get an r squared here and that would be fantastic but notice what else you get you'll get an r here that would be tough to deal with because you'd have to use a square root of x squared plus y squared you'd also lose your x because this is just x right now and that's very nice so sometimes the apparent right choice is not a good one if it starts making your equation explode so watch out for that if you're going along and you're man this is this is getting this is getting worse and worse this is not good at all what in the world am i doing wrong you might have you might have made a mistake go back and see if you can do something else so do i want to multiply both sides by r no not really because i lose my x and i make that much much more difficult instead i'm going to keep my 4 change this to an x because r cosine theta is x and i'm just going to deal with r as the square root i would have to have used it anyway here but it would have created a complete mess in other places so let's take that and make it the square root of x squared plus y squared this is just x equal to 4. now can we do a couple other things yeah we certainly can if we add x to both sides we could square it both sides so adding x if we have isolated a square root we can square both sides and distribute that and that gives us some like terms to combine in fact you can move everything to the left-hand side of your equation if you really want to if we subtract x squared our x squareds are gone subtract 8x you're going to get minus 8x and minus 16. y squared minus 8x minus 16 equals zero that's fine for our rectangular equation so we've converted from polar to rectangular now there's a few different ways you can write it we could actually have left it y squared equals 8x plus 16. that can be appropriate you can solve this for x actually so dividing by 8 1 8y squared minus 2 while this is not a function in terms of y this would be a function in terms of x it's actually a type two parabola so it is a conic section which one's easier to deal with here or there kind of depends on your preference really are you better at rectangular are you better at polar i'm just trying to get you comfortable with both i hope that explained it well enough that you can convert between a polar to rectangular by doing basically the exact opposite what we did in the last video using using things appropriately making sure that yes we can multiply both sides of an equation by r but if it starts exploding that's not the right thing to do and then being able to simplify some of these so i hope you've enjoyed it i hope it's made sense given just a few examples to illustrate how to convert from polar equations into rectangular have a great day
