Transcript for: Arithmetic Series (Precalculus - College Algebra 70)
hey there i think i might be going for record for conciseness on how concise i'm going to try to make this video it's not going to be long-winded could be very to the point about arithmetic series i'm going to give you a very straightforward approach to finding the sum it's a partial sum not an infinite sum of an arithmetic series i'll do one very quick example that'll make perfect sense i'm going to do another example that makes sense and i'm going to blow your mind on this example and relate it back to some of the formulas you're like what that's cool you should be like what that's cool because it is cool so arithmetic series what they mean we just talked about arithmetic sequences about how they're these list of numbers that are adding the same number over and over again well if you're adding the same number over over again and i add up all your terms there should be a very very predictable way to add a certain number or finite number of terms of that series that should make sense to us if we're adding the same number over and over again and we know where we start we should be able to find the sum very nicely so here's what this means if you have some sort of arithmetic series so notice the series adds up terms a sub 1 a sub 2 all the way to a sub n this would be what the series looks like notice something about it please get this this is an arithmetic sequence this is the sum of an arithmetic sequence hence an arithmetic series you start at one you need to know where you end so here's what this says to you and basically most of the time i just show from here to here here's how you find in general speaking the sum of an arithmetic series you need to know your first term you need to know your last term and you need to know how many terms you have is this hard to find no this is your first term that's your last term count up how many they are and then put those numbers here so if your first term is 60 and your last term is 120 and you know there's 16 terms which we don't know that yet but we will then you put 60 120 16 and you do the math on it is it hard to find if you have a formula like this no it's not because all you would do is you plug in one that's your first term plug in one to whatever your sequence is that goes here plug in wherever you end let's say that it's 16. so whatever your sequence is that goes there and then you plug in your n itself here it's very easy i'll show you that in this example so what if we wanted to add this but we didn't actually want to list out all the terms because there's 16 of them we only have five listed we missing 11 terms i want to do that let's try to build our sequence so our sequence says all right do you know your first term yeah do you know your last term yeah do you know your common difference i know if i subtract any two terms i get four can i create a sequence from that yeah of course of course we can we can create an arithmetic sequence from that we know arithmetic sequence is our first term n minus 1 times common difference so that would be our 60 plus n minus 1 times 4. well let's simplify that a sub n is 60 minus sorry plus 4 n minus 4 or 4 n plus 56 4 n plus 56. now there is a little issue that we don't know what our final term well we know our products versus 120. but we don't know what term that is this is how you can solve this if you understand that a sub n is 120 we can solve for n if we plug in a sub n hey that is a sub n if we plug in a sub n as 120 this will solve for what term this 120 actually is it has to so if i subtract 56 from that then 64 equals 4n if i divide both sides by 4 it says n is 16. we have found our first term founder common difference and created the arithmetic sequence upon which the series is based then we said all right well we know the last term we know less terms 120 we just don't know what term it is instead of sitting here and adding 4 until we get to 120 we go all right well i know the last term is 120 let's just plug in 120 and figure out what term that has to be plug in 120 subtract 56 divided by 4 we know that a sub 16 is 120 we know that that is the 16th term of this particular series now i'm going to go a little further you could be done right now you would hopefully understand that all you need to know to add this up is the first term we have it the last term we have it and what term that is it's the 16th term so what we're going to end up getting is 16 over 2 60 and 120 and we're going to add that very quickly however i'm going to show you what this would do too okay so if we understand that this is a an arithmetic series then this is the sequence upon which this series is built if you want to write this in series notation which sometimes you're required to do then we would start at one we'd have our sequence notice i'm switching to k i have to switch for k we've talked about why in previous videos but you can't start with n plug in some ends and end at n that doesn't make any sense you start with something different than n and end with whatever term you just found i need you to recognize that this is this thing if i were to take this sequence and put it in a series start at 1 and end at 16 this is exactly what i'm going to get and this is exactly what this would look like once you've found your sequence it's doing the same stuff actually we could prove it plug in one here if you plug in one you get four times one plus 56 that's 60. plug in two that would be eight plus 56 that's 64 and then 68 and plug in 16 you would get 120. so in either way you go find your first term find your last term a sub 1 a sub last that's 16 and then plug in n 16. so if we wanted to do it either way here's the way from kind of a logical standpoint and here's the way from our series i'll do the series first if you are just giving this you can verify its arithmetic series then here's what you do what you can do is you can take your first term plug in 1 that would be 60. plug in your last term a sub n plug in 16. that'd be 120 take whatever that n is and divide by two this will give you the sum of this series now as soon as you found this 16 you could have done it up here so if you wanted to make it even quicker take your first term take your last term take your once you found out that there's 16 total terms and divide by two we have the same math now once we figure that out that would be 8 times 180 1440 which is the sum of those 16 terms i hope it made that make sense to you i hope that you can see the creation of the sequence utilizing that to figure out how many terms are in the sequence and then using the formula that i gave you here as far as the the sum is concerned now what i will tell you is that this is provable by some stuff that we've already done and i'm going to show that to you right now oh man okay i'll believe my twice in this video if you look at this and you see right here can you recognize that this could be separated into a series of 4k plus a series of 56 the four could be moved out front and you have a series with just k in it do you remember that that was n times n minus 1 over 2 because that's exactly where this is coming from and i'll show you that in this example so what happens if you don't have an ending value what happens if you have this this series that goes from 2 plus four plus six all the way to two n but you don't know exactly what your n is then then you would do this you'd say all right what's my first term my first term is 2 my last term is 2n how many terms do i have n n terms not two n terms you have n terms now can we simplify that well sure sure if we distribute actually you know what i would do different i'm going to factor out the 2. i'm doing this on purpose so you see something if i factor out the 2 i get 1 plus n my two simplify i get n times n plus one now i told you i was going to blow your mind here it is firstly i hope that i made this make sense to you hopefully you can see if that's a series that's my first term my last term and you have n terms here since you don't know what n is there are n terms here just keep your n and then divide factor out that and simplify now here's the here's the cool part could we represent this as a sequence in some sort of series well i see 2 as my starting term i see 2 as my common difference i know that my sequence could be represented as 2 plus n minus 1 times 2. if i simplify i get simply 2 n just 2n now this is pretty cool if we write this as an actual series we would get the series of whatever the sequence is you write as a k but this is the sequence upon which that series is built you can see it right here if you start at one you'd have two times one that's two then put put in two two times two is four plug in three two times three is six put in n put in n that's your ending term that's what that is put an n two times n is two n that's why that's an ending term that's why you don't put 2n there it is the nth term it's just you're multiplying it by 2. now watch we did some formula work with some series a little while ago we know we can pull out constants we know there's a formula for this there's a formula for having k inside of our series it's a funny k if we go from 1 to n of k we know that that k is found by n n plus one over two now this would all be multiplied by two so here's our two here's our formula the twos cancel out and show you that this is exactly what we got right there all that formula stuff actually works if we can find a sequence for whatever we are dealing with hopefully it's fascinating to you hopefully you're seeing that that's where this stems from it stems from the idea that you can always break that down check it out this is a constant you could write this as a different series this is a k that relates to here you could write this somehow after factoring out a d you could write this as a series of k that's going to give you n times n n plus one over two that's exactly what we've done it simplifies gives us the same result that is the sum of that particular series which is the sum of even numbers this right there n times n plus one is the sum of any n even numbers so if you want to find out the first 20 even numbers and add them all up well you could just plug in 20 and that would add the even numbers 20 times 21 uh 420 i think if i did my math right okay one more thing so what if you're like yeah that makes sense or if you're like okay i can see your formula work but what if you also think what about that one does that still work that's clearly an arithmetic sequence we have talked about why we actually found that this is therefore an arithmetic series and the sum of an arithmetic series should be able to be found like this can it still work can we still take n over 2 our first term so plug in one that would be two our last term plug in n that would be plus two n and we can see that it does it gives us exactly the same thing as that right there so either way you go on any of this stuff you have to end up with the same sum of n times n plus 1 the sum of even numbers so anyhow that's the sum of even numbers i hope it made it make sense a couple connections there at the very end kind of fun you need to at least be able to do this to be able to find um a arithmetic series find the sequence make the series and find the sum of that thing so we'll see you next time for geometric sequences and a geometric series
