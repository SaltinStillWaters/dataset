Transcript for: Features of Graphs, Domain, Range (Precalculus - College Algebra 7)
hi welcome to another video hope you don't well he'll be rated for something we're going to talk about frequently which is which is graphs and right now in this video we're gonna learn about some features of graphs namely points domain and range so well this isn't gonna be a whole long exhaustive list of things we can do with graphs it's really nice to be able to start with health perhaps work and what what really is being asked because some of the terminology well it's not difficult to do can be a little confusing so we're gonna talk about how to find points in the graph what they mean when they're asking all of these questions we'll talk about domain and range quite a bit I'll also give you some very interesting examples where students get confused on why in the world the domain is this and what what that really means for a graph and it's very important to get what the domain is correct in your head so we'll talk about that a little bit we'll also talk about how to do this without a graph if you need to find this information without the actual picture of the function itself so that's the lesson for this video and then we'll continue next time Douglas more features so let's get right to it when we talk about graphs graphs of course or this this this this representation of every point that satisfies a function that you're given so we have an infinite number of points but sometimes what's going to be asked is well what about some specific points so what about F of 0 what in the world does that mean well what that is talking about when they're asking you F of 0 or F of negative 6 it says the functions the function itself is going to give you an output value we plug in a value we get an output out so input/output and it's the same what is the functions output value so the output of the function equals what when your input value is 0 in other words all this is really asking you to do is to complete a point so if we look at our graph and say what do you mean by complete a point if the input is 0 it's saying what's the output of the function given to your input is 0 its save complete this point here's your input of 0 find me the output so we look at our graphic ok here's my input my X is my input axis here's my input of 0 my output of my graph is 0 5 notice how the points given for you find it so this is saying complete this point really if your input is zero your output has to be five for this given function so this answer would be five you can just complete a point and that's what that's asking me to do same thing with F of negative six it says find me the outputs value the output of the function at an input of negative six so we go to our input axis our x-axis we go here's our negative six let's go up or down to where we meet the function let's find the point let's complete the point with an X in an input of negative six so here's negative six here's negative six negative three so really it's saying if you want to complete this point just find the point on the graph that has an x value of negative six and the output would be negative 3 that's what we're talking about here so really this is asking you to find points on the graph it says finding me the output when your input 0 find me the output when your inputs negative 6 find that functions output say complete the point with an x value observing suit respectively I'm kind of similar is this F of 3 so let's find f of 3 where that would be and just determine whether output is positive or negative so anytime they're talking about F of something f of X F of whatever it's an output idea so it's saying I want you to look at the y-value of whatever x value you're inputting so find me a point on the graph that has an output i started where the output is given by an input of 3 so in other words we're gonna go to the input value of 3 so f of 3 here's our x value of 3 find where the function is is it above or below well if we had to put a point on this graph where we would have three comma something an input value of 3 and then whatever output it'd be up here somewhere well it looks like it's about 4 it's not asking you whether it's for or not it's asking is the output value positive or negative and that's what the same it says given an input value of 3 what's the function doing what's its output is it positive or is it negative since we're above the x-axis all of these output values are positive this would just be positive for f of 8 we do the same thing we all right well tell me what the output is of what if our input is 8 functions is going to give us some sort of an output for the input of eight I'm gonna go to my x-axis for input at me and it's asking is that output value positive or negative well when we look at eight and says I want to I want to complete a point where we have eight comma something that's actually done for you here is eight comma negative three no way all right well I could actually feel that point and it's it's negative three it's given to me on that graph but what we're concerned about is the output value positive or negative is it above or below the x-axis well our Y values are all made of here so given an input of eight f of eight is asking you what's the output value for the input so basically complete the point in this case is just asking you is that output positive negative we're clearly negative hope that's making sense so far that's kind of the basics of how they ask you what points are on a graph they say find me the output value for it it just looks a little bit funny they're not asking specifically like that we can also do things like for what values of X is f of X equal to zero now here's what we really have to understand what the function notation means this says I want you to look for outputs of zero know that inputs of zero I'm not plugging in zero I'm not letting X equal zero don't have done that we know that if X is zero our outputs 5 we're done what this is saying is think differently think about every time where you have an output of zero so so really you could do this you could say I want to find points where my output is zero notice how points are set up points are always said X comma f of X and now I'm saying I want you to find me some points where this number over here is zero how many points do that well all of those points now I get this is important all of those points are going to be on the x axis all of those points are going to say hey here's an f of X of 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 here's an f of X of zero this whole force on the line represents points where your output would be zero and this is saying I want you to complete points what's your X when your output is zero it's same to find X intercepts this is just a way that they you do that so when they say find all the values where f of X is equal to zero same find all the values where your output is 0 find all the values on the x intercept on the x axis find all the values that are x-intercepts that's what that's a staple at this point well there's a there's a view we have negative 4 and output of 0 hey that's an x value 8 alpha 0 6 we're up at 0 and 10 where you're not concerned so for what X's is this output 0 for what X's do we have x-intercepts we'd say there's negative 4 6 and 10 those are the X values where we have an output of 0 on our graph so we have this negative 4 that's on the next axis that has an output of 0 at 6 and 10 you can write it like this me personally I really prefer to write points so I'd probably take this a little further and say well we have negative they don't specifically ask this let's say what for what it what x value is that I just like to make sure that my students know that those values are giving you X intercepts and X intercepts are the points on the graph they really are no we oftentimes just put X's and that's that's totally fine we all understand that x equals negative 4 is now an x intercept and say hey your output 0 on the x axis no problem x intercept and that's that's okay but I want to make sure you understand the our points so negative 4 0 6 0 10 0 or X intercepts on that graph where graph crosses the x axis okay I hope this making sense I hope you understand right now that really this is just asking you to complete a point where your X is 0 find the Y your X is negative 6 find a light or f of X Y or X is 3 is it is the output positive negative your X is 8 is the y night f of X value positive or negative this is different and this is saying now your Y value your f of X should I use zero find the X's that make that happen so we're at 0 over negative 4 0 ok 6 zero okay 10 we're thinking about differently how about the next one for what values is f of X greater than 0 this causes a lot of confusion in a lot of students because what students want to do is they want to follow this graph up and they go oh whoa I mean our we're greater than 0 zero and five obviously because this how that's how we're climbing when we understand functions what functions deal with the functions deal with almost exclusively the only one that doesn't really is range this idea of intervals on the x axis you see X is our independent variable X is what drives everything in our function so so when we think about that we think here's how this here's how this is really better awarded for what interval of your x-axis is your graph positive for what interval of your x-axis is your graph above the x-axis that's what this is asking so when we think about this you can't go this way you all right for what interval on the x-axis am i above it well let's think about it Aarthi is this range of your function or starting this I'll say piece is this piece of your function above the x-axis is it positive well no we know that the graph is above the x axis starting probably right here and ending right here and what we've just done is marked off the piece the interval of the x-axis where the function is positive that's exactly what is asking find me the x-values where your function is positive that's this interval of X's that's what that's asking you it says give me the piece of the x-axis where I'm above the X it's not it this way idea it's a x-axis idea almost everything we talked about is an x-axis idea we find x-intercepts y-intercept we got that but we have an X X interval here that says for the the interval of numbers between x equals negative 4 and x equals 6 my graph is going to be positive and we have two ways to write that so we're gonna say all right you know what one way I could write this for what X is is my my function positive well you already know how to find positive right you knew that at 3 we were positive at 8 we were negative this is saying fine to find a whole range of a whole interval of them so our interval from negative 4 to 6 is going to give me positive outputs way to write that is from negative 4 to 6 those are the values of exes right we said hey all this will range from negative 4 X is somewhere between here to 6 we're going to get positive outputs that's exactly the questions asking you the other way that we can write this is something called interval the notation yeah in my opinion it's not the best notation because it ends up looking a lot like points but it is one way that we can represent this and you need to know it so the other way that we can write this is hey you know what from if I want to write the X values from negative 4 to 6 I can also write it like this the interval of the x axis where we have positive outputs is from x equals negative 4 to x equals 6 but but not quite equal you see if we let this equal notice if we let this equal I'm really not positive at this point right there at that point I'm not positive not negative I'm 0 well that's not what this is asking you this is saying where is your graph strictly positive not equal to 0 or we would include the negative or we would include the 6 sometimes telling you it's saying I want you to be strictly positive and that says well I can't really include those X intercepts because add an x intercept I'm equal to 0 and I don't want to be equal to 0 I want to be positive so we can't include that for that reason we'd show this interval with what are called parentheses this represents the same exact thing that says hey the X values for which your function is positive is negative 4 and 6 but not including those two endpoints or negative 4 to 6 but not including those two endpoints to include them we use a bracket and I'll show you that when we talk about the domain okay how about the you should try this right now what about the function where's the function less than 0 oh you know what I missed one I'm sorry where's the function greater than 0 we have one interval I talked about that but there's also this other one right over here well yeah we're not we're not above the x-axis here that's that's below that's it that's outputs that are negative or above the x-axis or outputs are positive from negative 4 to 6 not between 6 and 10 but then from 10 to 11 we're also positive so the way we're gonna write that all right this all together is we have this we also have an interval right here from 10:00 to 11:00 this little interval not up and down flip x-axis wise we say the X values that are giving us positive outputs are also found from 10 to 11 so this is one way we can write it with with these inequality notation we can also say all right so interval notation we go negative 4 to 6 no problem and then we also go from 10 to 11 and that little you there is a union it's saying this interval combined with this or this interval or this interval are going to give you values that are positive our outputs are positive I hope that you stick with me here I hope that's making sense to your seeing the interplay between the X intervals and the outputs and we're always pretty much always talking about the X interval and we're talking about increasing and decreasing we're talking about we've done that yet we're talking about positive versus negative functions you're talking about domain we'll be getting that in a second all right now we're ready to go ahead and look at what what interval of x-axis is our function below 0 so same question only in reverse and you can probably see it right now you should be doing this we notice that our function is below the x-axis here and again over here what we're going to look at it is what interval of the x-axis gives us outputs that are negative what interval in x axis has my graph below the x-axis well that looks like it's from negative 6 to negative 4 same idea if we're an eye kind of figure if we're not above and we're not constant we're not at 0 then we're below so the intervals that we didn't just mark off for being above the x-axis probably are going to give us below that would be negative 6 to negative 4 now we can cause of it both ways so negative 6 to negative 4 give us an interval on the x-axis where we are negative also from 6 to 10 that gives us an interval on the x-axis where outputs are below the X or negative if we want to write interval notation really similar we're gonna do negative 6 to negative 4 we're gonna do parenthesis because again we're not equal to we're not saying less than or equal to we're saying it's strictly negative if I let the equals go I'd include those values but here I can't include the values negative 6 negative 4 6 or 10 because that would give us a zero and I'm saying I don't want to be equal to zero I want to be strictly less than that'll to be negative we'd also go from 6 to 10 and we show that with parentheses and are just strict inequalities there of of less then that's got to make sense we go any further we gotta understand how to find some points and how what they mean by that got to find positive and negative and what they mean by saying hey what's your output value when your X's substance notes we've got to really understand what this is about when they're saying f of X equals a number they're saying I want you to find X values that give me that yield that output value so this is saying I want to find X's when my output is zero no problem this is saying I want you to give me the interval of the x-axis where I am positive or the interval that x-axis where I'm negative it's not an up-and-down idea no we want that to be the case it's an interval of the X idea it's always from this X to this X all right moving on a little bit what the domain means and we talked about this in another video the domain is this idea what inputs I can plug in to a function and get an output well graphically what that means is what section of the x-axis does my graph cover what interval of the x-axis does my graph cover that is what the domain means so it's a very one-dimensional back and forth idea so domain says alright look at my function tell me the X tell me the entire interval the x-axis of this thing covers and we see it right away the interval is that this graph covers on the x axis so our domain our inputs are x x axis is our given axis says our graph covers what portion of that well it's from negative 6 to 11 that's the section of the x-axis from here to here and it covers all of this I think I just ruin that pen oh well so that is what the domain means says just give me the inputs what are English flexes well that means is that the one of the values are given me actual outputs all right well that would be a section or an interval of the x-axis that's giving me some sort of a graph in other words what's the graph cover the graph covers on the x-axis from negative 6 to 11 so we can write like this we have that X such that we remember the set builder notation X such that X is between negative 6 and 11 notice the difference here I use something that I didn't use over here over here was strict inequalities because we wanted to be less than zero we didn't want our function to equal zero or greater than zero as the case would be you know we're saying oh no no no give me every value of x that gives me an output well does negative six and does 11 give you an actual output yes and so we have to include those values that let me do that is there the less than or equal to and with a parenthesis are instead of a parenthesis with a bracket so when we're talking about domain and we have an actual physical point where we are ending we're gonna say I want to include that I want to make sure that my set notification has an equals saying yes this value is included in my domain in my cinnamon puts its give me an actual real number and output my graph is on those values so there or we can do interval notation say hey we're going between those values and including them that's what that bracket does range is the idea a little bit harder to do because we're because we can go back and forth looking at it vertically domains a little bit easier because looking at the x-axis saying hey you can really cover it at one point but with range it's a little little more challenging because we can cover part of the y-axis and cover it again we don't necessarily have to be a 1 one function X axis is just vertical line test passes this is a function every single vertical lines going across our graph one time no matter what like x equals three okay that's only one output value and so it's kind of easy to see hey this is this graph covers this part of my x axis range says tell me what tell me what section what interval of the y axis or f of x axis my graph covers my graph gives me outputs there so we're looking on both sides here figuring out what section of the Y does this graph cover I'm not I'm only going on the Y I've notice only on the domain I didn't go off of the x axis at all same thing with the range I cannot let my pen move off of this y axis so I'm looking what's my lowest value on the Y what what output does that cover well it covers down at negative 3 all of these outputs are covered somewhere it doesn't matter how many times they come I don't care that's what makes a little challenging is making sure you're covering it and then okay the highest value we're getting is 5 so the interval that we cover on the y axis is from negative 3 to 5 that is what the range means and we can use Y we can use f of X you'll see both you probably should use that f of X but I want to make sure I give that to you and we'd say all the output values can be found between negative 3 & 5 including those notice how we actually obtain a negative 3 we actually attained a 5 so we have to show that with that less than or equal to we also have to show that with brackets okay now how about x-intercepts well wait a minute x-intercepts x-intercepts are the function the function outputs would be zero the function outputs would be someone down here you've already done that when you find f of x equals zero you are finding x-intercepts if they exist so this is a redundant collection so we'd say hey where our functions value was 0 where output height with zero we'd be on the x-axis we already found that X is where that's the case so this is basic basically kind of reinforcing that hey you know these numbers over here yeah that's what you're finding so your x-intercepts are maybe 4 0 6 0 10 0 now can a function has more than one x-intercept and still be a function of past vertical line test of course can a function have more than one y-intercept and still be a function no that would fail the vertical line test that would fail the idea of a one input needs to give you exactly one output so your y intercept there needs to be only one of them if if there even exists one so the y intercept is where we cross the y axis we cross the y axis right here at 0 5 and that's what that's asking for notice how every single y intercept is going out an x value 0 of course yeah it's gotta be on the axis just like every y x-intercepts gonna have a y-value is 0 alright last couple here how many times does the y equal 2 line cross the graph well y equals 2 let's see y equals 2 here's here's the y axis here's here's 2 y equals 2 would be a constant so how many times that or is our line cross our graph I don't care where it crosses it's just asking how many times it crosses that would be 2 times that so that's asking you last one students get super confused about those ago I understand the x intercept idea yeah yeah if I said equals 0 I'm just find out where we cross the x axis but how I introduce that to you I said really think about this as you're trying to complete some points trying to complete a point where your output is zero finding the inputs I don't know the X find me the input when you're up at zero okay here's my output zero out to zero zero I'd have an input of negative four and input of six and the input of ten and that would give me my outputs of zero this is doing the same thing it's saying for what X does f of X equal three it's saying complete the point where your output is 3 every time we say f of X equals 3 is saying I want that output to be 3 so do we have some points where we have a three well let's see 3 is positive 3 is going to be above our x-axis somewhere so I'm looking above here looking for my Y value or f of X value 3 I'm saying oh wait a minute hey here's a y value 3 right there here's Y value 3 here's another Y value of 3 oh there's two points it's ok to have two points yeah sure it says for what X is business work it's okay to have more than one in our case this says negative two would give me an output of negative positive 3 and 4 would give me an output of 3 so I'm looking for the x value that's causing my function to have an output value 3 complete the point here's negative 2 and here is 4 if you didn't have these points listed it'd kind of be a guessing game unless you have a rectangular coordinate showing you this so we'd have to sort of guess where here's my here's my output of 3 and we go over and say my output of 3 has a Oh 8 input of 4 my output of 3 also has an input of negative 2 you'd have to do it that way last one you should be doing on your own give me give me some X values or complete the point that says I want the functions output this is an output of negative 3 so I'm gonna say looks like 2 points you should be finding those two points right now just think it may be thinking in your head there's two of them you say well what is mine what's an input value that's going to be giving me an output of negative 3 or find the input that gives me the output three here's a negative three we could go over we hit our graph here without points already listed for us or say an input value of eight is what's giving me the output this way an input value of negative six is what's give me the output we've completed that point input value maybe six I hope that's made sense that's a lot about graphing as far as what the points mean what they mean what would what it looks like to ask what a point is on a graph and that's what that's doing saying and finally an input if I give you an output over there finally the output if I give you an input completely those points we talked about what x-intercepts are what that looks like what it means when they're asking you f of X equals zero we also talked about domain and range so the section of the x-axis your graph covers that your main section of the y-axis your graph covers that's your range I'm gonna come back in just a second we'll talk about some sort of tricky problems that the domain and range will be more into that and I can ask you about points anymore and then I'll show you how to do this stuff without a graph all right let's get after it so on these four graphs were just going to be talking about domain we're talking about range just making sure that we really understand that it's a big deal so what the domain means is the the portion of section the interval of the x-axis that your graph covers so we're just looking into x-axis as you know very quickly what this says is that hey you know what if I look at my first graph the section of the x-axis is from here to here I don't care that it's PI and negative types of little little selectable strange for us but it's just a trig function we'll talk about that when we get to trigonometry no problem but our domain and that's huge to know what the domain is for trig functions is from negative PI to PI the interval of the x-axis that my graph covers is negative PI to PI now think am I going to be using equals and brackets or not well the points are included so I would say we have X's from negative PI including that value 2 pi interval notation just being negative PI to PI with brackets the the interval of the y-axis or F of x-axis that our graph is covering says well we have the smallest value of negative 1 and the largest value of 1 and we're covering everything in between there so for our range we'd have Y values such that we're going from negative 1 those are always in order to 1 including those values because those points actually exists there and the interval notation says from negative 1 to 1 a hell that's making sense the interval the x axis that our graph covers its domain interval the y axis our graph covers that's our range if we take a look at this one I'm going to do so next the interval of the x-axis that our graph covers some students get really confused the errors and go oh I'm going up I must follow this up think about the x axis only so if you think I can only move my pencil across this just one dimension not too dimensionally just one dimensionally how far will I eventually go well eventually my pencil is going to have covered everything in here so this whole section but it will cover everything this way and it will eventually cover everything this way notice this graph is continue it's shown to continue like this it will eventually though cover the entire x axis so because the domain is the interval of the input axis our x axis that our graph covers this graph will ultimately cover the entire x axis that needs to make sense to you so this is everything from negative infinity to positive infinity how we show that it's a X such that X is probably just all real numbers we could write all real numbers we could write negative infinity less than X less than infinity if you want if you do write that don't include the equals because we can't ever reach that infinite just as it goes forever basically don't include the equals we always have parenthesis we always have strictly less than 4 infinities or we simply put all real numbers now is the range going to cover sorry is this graph going to cover the entire range of our y-axis no no this is a horizontal asymptote and this is an exponential function I try to write e to the X for you you probably have seen that at some point but this is a at least an exponential function and it has a horizontal asymptote which means as it's coming from this way it came from being really really really really really close to zero and if you look at it going to the left it's gonna get really really really really really close to zero as we approach negative infinity but it never hits that zero so as far as the range is concerned we're not covering the entire y axis or basically covering from zero upward remember this is a one dimension idea x axis you can only go back and forth relax you can only go up and down so we're covering from zero but not including it and then to infinity so our Y values are Y such that Y is greater than or 0 is less than Y to infinity we can't include the zero because we never actually attain it we just get really really close to that that idea is super important for us to accurately find the domain of problems like these two with that open circle and what's that mean talk about that a second or from zero to infinity so the section of the x-axis that our graph covers domain we got that down y-axis is a range now when we do the problems like this they're a little funky because what that open circle means is that that point is missing we get right up to it it's called the removable discontinuity most of the time in calculus we call that this says yeah there's there's an endpoint here but this endpoint is missing so how in the world are we going to define our domain the section of our x-axis that our graph covers if we're missing a point well well let's look at it what section of the x-axis do we actually cover now I think we all agree well on the x-axis we're only going left and right one dimensionally it includes everything from here including that zero and then it goes all the way up to the four it includes things like 3.9 3.9 99 three point nine nine for a really long time it just doesn't include the for think about it that's very similar to what this did this would have values of like point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one as an output it just would never attain the zero how we show that is with parentheses we say it's really close but it never really gets there this is really close to four but it never really gets there all right it's gonna be a parentheses around the four it says that we get really close to it as close as you can get without touching it but we don't include the actual value so that's that point I mean so close it just it doesn't move before you don't stop the three you don't sell for three point nine that's not nearly close enough we go way closer and that's what the parentheses tells us it says that we're very close but we just do not include it's basically excluding one point just the endpoint so our domain here says two ways number one the section of the x-axis that our graph covers starts at zero and we include it there's an actual point there and it ends at four but we dis include it there is not a point at the four do you notice that the two inequalities were using them so yep we actually can attain the zero section x-axis has a point there and then we say well two four but not including that because at that for or we're missing the point don't don't miss the point so we're gonna be getting really really really close but that point is missing so the section xx that we're actually covering stops it gets really made actually doesn't really stop it gets really really really close to two for as close as possible without including it already interval notation says zero to four with a bracket around the zero because we do include it on the x-axis but not for the range is quite similar you probably can do this on your going as far as the range is concerned the section of the y-axis that we're covering is from zero to five so look at it this way so turn your head like that and we have another number line saying yep word we're gonna go and erase that we are including that zero sure that is an output value that we act attain but we don't really get an output of five so close to it input a form you almost get that output a five we almost get that we're so close four point nine nine but to show that we said the section of our y-axis that we actually cover is from zero including it but up to five okay and the last one maybe try it on your own I want you to think about what section of the x-axis your graph covers what section the y-axis where your graph ultimately cover as far as the x axis this graph has a this is like a logarithm this graph has a vertical asymptote so well it gets really close to zero does it ever actually touch x equals zero no that's domain isn't strictly on the x axis idea you just look at this graph say hey if I superimpose the graph on my x-axis is going to cover from here all the way up to here that's all we're doing at the end of the section of the x-axis your graphic covered is this section of the x-axis well that's from 0 to 7 but I can't include either to zero because they've never get I never get in I'm not allowed even to put it and put it in there there's no output from that zero and so that's not a valid input because it's not giving us an output for this graph also 7 I can't include the 7 because it's not a valid input that's giving us about an output it's not giving us an output so we can't include it saying you know what the domain is the domain is a set of inputs that are giving us outputs and zeros not giving us an output and 7 not is not giving us an output we can't include them so we're going to show that we disagree them or from 0 to 7 interval notation idea for the y-axis that range the section of the the y-axis at your graph covers this is going all the way down to negative infinity so we're going from negative all the way up to 12 but we don't include either one so we can't it says there's not an actual output at negative infinity because you can't ever get there there's not an actual output of 12 because that point is missing but we get really close and it's the two ways I can explain the thus getting their idea we don't include it so we have some y-values that are from negative infinity and we get almost to 12 that's what that means or we get to a valid output that's just before 12 but we can't include that as well it's not about an output for us and likewise for interval notation negative infinity I hope that's made sense I hope that graph I wanna be done with graphs or now hopefully agraphia understand the domain the range idea students get really confuse the domain of range they don't understand what it is because it's never talked to them very well like hey what domain is for a graph it's just the section of the x-axis that this is actually covering if you have if you have inputs that are not giving you outputs or not giving you valid outputs then you must not include them and we do that with a parenthesis lastly what if you don't have a graph can we still do some things if we don't have a graph yeah um it might not be as easy sometimes a little bit easier but let's go through and see if we can find some things that are similar what we've done such as making you find points can you find points where you have an output given on an input can you find the domain X intercepts and y intercepts so some of the big ideas here if I asked you for F of one remember what that means this is here's f of X F of an input value that I want your input value to be one okay so what I'm asking to do is complete the point where your input value is one that's what I'm asking if I plug in one if I evaluate for one well that's doing it this is finally an output value for X here's the formula for doing that find me an output value when X is 1 so 1 plus 2 is 3 1 minus 16 is 5 we have negative 3/5 in other words I'm just asking to complete a point just like we did from four graphs but instead of a graph a picture of the the function I'm giving you the actual formulaic algebraic way to manipulate that so you plug in 1 you get an output you complete the point now this product hardest one what if I say now I don't want you to find an output given an input this says I want you to find me an input notice what that is it says your your inputs give you your total output so it says the output of a function here's my function for my input values of X here's I want you to find me to output one of the info values one we plugged in 1 it says I want you to find me oh wait I want you to have an output of 2 find me the inputs I don't know my ex I'm looking for my input value when my output is 2 look at the way that your function is designed assigned very well it says can you replace f of X with 2 well wait a minute here's f of X can I replace this whole thing that says this piece your output this is 2 so we'd say alright if f of X equals x plus 2 over X minus 6 and I tell you that I want that output to be 2 I'm going to really say f of X is X plus 2 over X minus 6 now f of X is 2 I can replace the f of X with that 2 and then I can solve for X we're gonna spend some time on this because it's incredibly important we get it with finding inverses we do this a lot with exponential functions we talk about it sometimes on even versus odd and domain so I need to show no sorry inverse a lot of inverses not even on so here's how to solve an equation when you have variables in more than one spot on a fraction number one this is a proportion this is a rational equation and so we can and need to multiply both sides by the LCD we're going to do that so we're gonna multiply by X minus 6 on both sides of our equation but we're only doing that so that we can cancel out that denominator we want to be able to do that and yes we're going to distribute 2x minus 12 equals x plus 2 in the future what's happen is that we are going to have two variables up here and I want to start this idea right now so that I can kind of preface your learning when we get way in the future right here it's going to be fairly easy because we're addition multiplying both sides by your denominator but in the future I want you to look at what would happen if we had a variable here instead of a number so think about what you do now is this is something you know how to do and then we're gonna apply it later something you don't know what I do so please focus here how you go ahead and solve this you all know you all know that you're going to subtract your ex from both sides and you're going to add your 12 why because you want to get all the terms with the variable you're trying to solve for on one side and all the terms without that variable on the other side the same exact logic even though right now is going to work later for inverses and later with exponential functions and solving those things so please keep in mind what we're doing here is you're getting rid of your fraction by multiplication yes you are distributing yes but then you're trying to group your terms with X on one side and non X's on the other just keep that in mind because it's going to come back at us so X minus 12 would equal to yes we add our 12 and get everything that's not an X on the other side that's X would equal 14 older than that right well you know what you can check your work couldn't you if you plug in 14 it should give you up to so 14 plus 2 that's 16 14 minus 6 well it's 860 number 8 is 2 so we know that we're writing we've completed a point that you can show that this says I want you to complete a point where your output value is 2 have you done it yeah yeah yeah 14 you've completed the point and that's what that's asking you for domain all I'm hoping you remember domain remember the domain right now there's two issues with functions we have square roots or even roots and then we have denominators and we don't have those generally our domains all real numbers to tell you they're logarithms so here we go we don't have any square roots that looks fantastic but we do have a denominator what we know about doing the denominators is that if denominators equals zero we've got to make issue we have an undefined value so what the domain is is the set of inputs that give you defined real number outputs well x equals 6 would give you an undefined value and an undefined situation and so we say well you know what yeah it might denominator equals 0 this is going to create a big problem for me you talked about a long time ago but X equals 6 is not a good thing it's it's an input that's not defined it's an input where the output is not defined and so we'd say you know what we need to dissin clued that so our domain is x value such that X does not equal 6 if you forgot about interval notation is a little bit a little bit worse than that so if if 6 is the only number that doesn't work I'm dissing cluding it then really the domain is from negative infinity to 6 and I'm dissing cluding that remember how parenthesis dissing food of value decision to go up to five point nine a ten a nine and then from six point zero zero or 1 or whatever to infinity but you're just dis including the six X intercepts X intercepts are found very similar to to setting your functions output equal to zero or equal to two so let's see what's x intercepts X intercepts say I want your output to be zero until we found them on the graph and that's exactly how we find them now it's a little bit easier in this I'll talk about why in a second but I need you to understand the idea an x intercept is where the height of your function is zero so if your height of your function is given by your output set your output equal to zero this will always give you X intercepts in any sort of a function so if we say I want my output to be 0 well that is an x intercept I want my wait a minute here's my function value so if I set my x plus 2 over X minus 6 equal to zero this is saying I took my function I replaced my output with 0 this is saying I want my output to be 0 here that is where our X intercepts would come from now why did I say it's gonna be easier than this well can you still multiply both sides by X minus 6 yes but what is 0 time's anything well 0 times anything is is zero so if I multiply both sides by X minus 6 it's going to give me still 0 on the left hand side and X minus 2 on the right hand side listen when you have a rational function and you're trying to find your X intercepts the way that we appropriately do that by understanding that when you find X intercepts you're setting your function equal to zero really all you have to do is take your numerator and set it equal to 0 why because firstly your denominator can't equal 0 and if it does you get some problems your numerators the only thing that can equal 0 and if you multiply both sides by X minus 6 is 0 anyway so really just set your numerator equal to 0 and you'll find whatever x-intercepts you have whatever ones are relevant so if I subtract 2x is equal negative 2 what that's saying is that we have an x intercept at negative 2 0 don't just don't just think negative 2 think about how this is a natural point so on your graph you'd be crossing the graph at megohm to 0 wherever whatever that graph looks like last one the y intercept y intercepts are always found by plugging in 0 so don't get these two confused x-intercepts setting equal to 0 usually it's just a numerator for rational functions and then we solve that for y intercepts miners have say hey you know what what is your if you what is it where you cross the y axis well that's gonna be where your x is 0 so if I take my x value of 0 and plug it in that says I want you to find the output when your x value input is 0 it's going to give you a help with its on the y axis that be 0 plus 2 over 0 minus 6 and that's negative 1/3 again this thing is a point you plugged in 0 you got off negative 1/3 that is your y-intercept I hope that this has made sense and I've Illustrated how to find points on graphs I know it's fairly basic but sometimes we could confusing this stuff and once you understand it very very well mostly I need to understand the domain and the range idea the domain is a section of the x-axis your graphs covering the range of the section of the y-axis that your graph is covering this is also very this last example make sure you understand that an input value is absolutely find an output value giving you an output values that you find input value but in both cases you're really just to believe the points if I give you an input plug it in if I give you an output if to set it equal to the output and solve find the domain well we know our two issues we know square roots and denominators so we know the square roots need to be inside positive or greater than an equal to zero denominators cannot equal zero so we set the equals zero and say I must exclude that value other any other number works just fine x-intercepts are basically this problem we'll just say your output is now zero and not two so set your output equal to zero okay my f of X is now 0 and we solve y-intercept just plug in 0 so next time we'll talk about well we'll really go through and talk about even versus odd some of some of these other features of functions that are there coming up at us so I'll see you for that you
