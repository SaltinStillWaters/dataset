Transcript for: Inequalities with Rational Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 47)
hey everybody i hope you're ready for another video and i hope you're doing well so welcome and let's get started um today in this video what we're going to do is we're going to talk about rational inequalities now the last video we talked about polynomial inequalities and a lot of the same things you're going to hold true here the where the truth is opposite across odd multiplicity and the truth is the same across even multiplicity with regard to x-intercepts but also with regard to vertical asymptotes so with these rational functions we know that we can change sine or be above or below the x-axis above or below zero where we cross the x-axis but we can also be have different signs where we have vertical asymptotes where we can do this or the same when we can do this and so what it comes down to is with rational inequalities we're going to do the following things we're going to find the x intercepts we're going to find the vertical asymptotes we're going to put them on a number line and we're going to see whether those have even or odd multiplicity and that will help determine the truth here's the main points that i need you to know number one you're going to set your numerator equal to 0 and find x-intercepts you're going to set your denominator equal to 0 and find vertical asymptotes and we're going to write down for both of those whether we have an even or an odd the truth remains the same for both sides of an even multiplicity x intercept or an even multiplicity vertical asymptote the truth will be opposite on either side of a odd multiplicity x intercept or an odd multiplicity vertical asymptote so let's get right into it we're going to see that as we work through it i'll be re-explaining as we go i've known to do and then we'll talk about what happens if you don't have zero what if you have a constant there or another function even what that means so let's get to it what we want to do because we know that the sign can change at x-intercepts or vertical asymptotes for our function we're going to find both of those so we start by setting our numerator equal to zero what this does is this says i want you to find where this function crosses this thing now i'm prefacing what we're going to be doing if this thing is not 0. if it's another number or a function we're basically finding the intersection of this function and that in this case it's the x-axis in this case it's zero so that's why we're setting our numerator equal to zero and that's because this function can only equal zero if our numerator equals zero in general we're checking where this equals this function where they intersect so since this is already factored this is very nice for us we know that we can we can set each of those factors equal to zero by the zero product property and we know a couple things about it these are x-intercepts where this function crosses this zero the x-axis we also know because they came from factors that had the first power these are odd multiplicity that means they're crossing so at this point we know this function has two x-intercepts both are crossing they're right there that that means something that means that these are two opportunities for this function to change sign to go from above to below zero or below to above zero or stay below zero or above zero the next thing we've gotta do is find any vertical asymptotes that we have so we're gonna look at our denominator we're gonna think hey if the denominator equals zero i have myself a vertical asymptote nothing's going to cancel out here that would create a hole but not necessarily a change in sign and so what we're going to do is look for vertical asymptotes really that's about it so we're going to check that out a vertical asymptote here is going to occur when our denominator equals zero and we know that's a vertical asymptote and it's odd in our heads we should be thinking what that looks like that looks like if a vertical asymptotes here that looks like this or like this that's odd multiplicity that means we're gonna have opposite infinities so let's put these on the number line this x-axis and let's see what happens so let's see we've got an x intercept at negative two a vertical asymptote of one we're putting these in order and an x intercept of three and we're going to label what these are it's really important to understand that to label them these are not all x-intercepts that's a vertical asymptote and why it's important is when we write out the intervals for which this is true for which the the solution set for this this rational inequality we want to make sure we know what we're dealing with you see if we have a less than or equals 2 we're going to include where this function is on the x-axis but we can't include a point if it's a vertical asymptote so we're going to show that that way when we get there we can make sure we use parentheses and not brackets but it all comes down to listing that help and so we do a lot of things that we're used to we write down that for x-intercepts we have a bouncer across you right appropriately due to our multiplicity these are crosses and a vertical asymptote we're going to identify that as a vertical asymptote and that this is odd so we have a couple choices number one you could you could draw this like a picture of a graph like we do for polynomials and that does work so if we had a vertical asymptote here and we know that that is odd and we have a cross and across if we take the time to do end behavior which this is going to be a a slant asymptote actually we're going to get across up and then down up so that's that's what this looks like but it's probably a little bit easier just to plug in a value for for one of these intervals see whether that's true or false that one value is going to represent every single input for that entire interval and determine whether that whole section is above or below whatever value that is now why do we only check one number not lots of numbers well we found all the places where this function could possibly change from being above to below this where it intersects it that's it that's in this case x-axis or where we have a vertical asymptote this is going to be the same exact logic that we're going to use if that number is not zero where we intersect it and where vertical asymptotes occur are where this function can change from being above to below this one that's the idea in this case it's just the x-axis it's just zero we're thinking positive versus negative so we're going to check that right now so the easiest value that we can check is zero we're going to plug in zero so if we eval we evaluate for 0 we're taking 0 and we're evaluating it here 0 minus 3 well that's negative 3 times 2 that's negative 6 over negative 1. so we're just simply evaluating this there if you want to see a little more clearly zero minus three zero plus two zero minus one or evaluated for zero and we're getting that this is negative six over negative one which simplifies a six and we know that's not true six is not greater than or equal to zero so this is a false interval and that means that every input in here what's going to happen is if we put in any input between negative two and one it's going to give us a value that is positive y positive well we plugged in 0 to give us a positive value it's given us something that's not less than 0 this would be something above the x axis remember we found out where we can possibly change from positive to negative it's at x-intercepts and it's an asymptotes there's no other points where we can change from positive negative and that's true that all of these inputs are either going to give positive like it did in this case or negative which is what we were looking for so this would be false we plugged in zero it gave us something not true gave us something positive we were looking for below zero looking for negative now here's what we can do because these multiplicities are all odd so they're crossings and they're odd multiplicity think about what would happen if this is false meaning this is positive this is this is creating a positive interval of outputs then this would be negative because we would be crossing the x-axis that's that's a true statement so these are positives outputs these are negative outputs wait if these are positives and not about not less than zero these are negatives and they would be less than zero if you plug in negative three it's going to work uh negative three minus three that's negative six uh times negative one well that's negative sorry positive six divided by 4 that's going to be a um let me do that right sorry negative 4 that's going to be a negative number and so that's a negative output that's less than zero this would be true okay well what about asymptotes remember that what asymptotes do for odd multiplicity is they're opposite so if this is going to positive infinity this one's coming from negative infinity well that means that it's below the x-axis that means that this would be negative values and this because we're crossing x-axis would be positive values and since we're checking for we want negative outputs these are gonna these are gonna be exactly what these truths are notice one thing this this makes it hopefully really easy for you if you if you have odd multiplicity your truth has to be opposite so true false true false because this is odd multiplicity odd multiplicity and odd multiplicity we can think of it as hey we're crossing your signs going to change odd multiplicity your sign is going to change crossing your sign is going to change and that is what we're checking for i hope that makes sense number one just find where numerator equals this thing in this case is zero those are x intercepts and then we're finding a vertical asymptote those are the possible sign changes for a function in this case the actual sign changes they're all odd our signs will change every single one of those x values one being a vertical asymptote now that's that's important because when we go and we write down the interval for which this is true so the solution said we cannot ever include a vertical asymptote well because there's no point there it's undefined so what we're going to say is we want it to be less than or equal to 0. all of the outputs from this interval of inputs are going to give us values less than zero let's say a different way this portion of the x-axis is giving you negative outputs by giving you outputs less than zero or below the x-axis so that's a true statement we're going to write that out as negative infinity to negative two because we are including including right there those values that equal zero those values that are x-intercepts we're going to include this input that gives us 0 and you can see it right here you plug in negative 2 it's going to give you a 0. that's an x-intercept that's on our graph on the x-axis and that says that's okay we want something where we include the x-values that give us 0. that's one of them we included now the other other interval starts at one and ends at three just this little interval we don't write down the false intervals just the true ones but when we go from one to three sure three is an x intercept that's why we write the cross down so that we understand that's an x intercept and that should be included if we have this less than or equal to zero so we're going to include the three but because that one is a vertical asymptote and there is no output there we're going to disinclude that so that says that every single x value on these intervals here or in this interval notation thing that we have is going to give you an output that is negative or zero that's zero that's zero the rest of these are negative even this one because this doesn't include one this would include like 1.00001 which would be really really really negative like close to close and negative and you can't do that but um it would be extraordinarily negative and that's the that's the case here so just to make it easy don't include your vertical asymptote that's why we write this so that we see it we go yeah i'm never going to include that so one last thing before we move on what if this was not here the only things that would change if we don't have the equals is you would use parentheses with the negative 2 and with the 3 because we would want to be strictly below the x axis strictly below 0 strictly negative and those values right there would give you 0 and not negative so we just put parentheses there you leave this one because that's a vertical asymptote you're good no matter what on that okay let's try the next one so we have something very similar the only change is that we have greater than or equal to zero so what this means is that we've got this rational function we're asking what is the interval of inputs what portion of the x-axis is going to give me outputs that are positive or on the x-axis so greater than 0 above the x-axis or on it because that equals so we're going to do two things number one what we're going to do is we're going to set our numerator equal to 0 to find x-intercepts the reason why it's zero we're figuring out where this crosses that and because that is zero we say hey the only place that can happen is where our numerator equals zero that's true this is going to change in a minute when that's not zero we'll set the entire function equal to that and we'll have to multiply by the denominator here that's not necessary i'll show you why in just a second so we're going to find our x-intercepts and then we'll find our vertical asymptotes by setting the denominator equal to zero so step one let's set our function equal to zero i'm going to show you right now why if this is zero it's just the numerator so if we had x plus five squared over x squared minus four and we said hey the only places where where a rational function can change signs or be above or below this is where we have intersections or where we have a vertical asymptote so we're going to do the intersections so how you find the intersection of any two functions you set them equal but we understand about this because we're pretty good at rational functions if you set this equal to zero because that's zero this denominator has no chance of making this equal to zero and if i were to multiply both sides by x squared minus four this does absolutely nothing and it says well that's going to be zero anyway and these would cancel out if you will and for that reason that's what you'll see in a lot of textbooks and what i said even is that if you want to find x-intercepts of a rational function which is what this is talking about in relation to the x-axis you just set the numerator equal to zero because the denominator would cancel itself out anyway if we have zero if it's not zero that's a different story and that's the last two examples that we do so hey look at this it's nice it's already factored it's got a power two we know that if we set the numerator equal to zero and we solve it the factor that has the x is x plus five equals zero we get negative five and because that's a multiplicity two we know that that is going to be a balance or a touch next up what we're going to do is we're going to find any sort of vertical asymptote that we have what happens is that we've got a factor of denominators first figure that out and so we know that x squared minus four equaling zero that's kind of that's a that's a bad thing or at least it's a thing that we won't get a defined output for so if we set our denominator equal to zero and we factor it we see that we have two factors each to the first power now keep in mind this was x-intercepts we know that intersects the x-axis and that is a balance these things are coming from the denominator so don't lose track of what we have these are going to be vertical asymptotes one at negative two and one at positive two but we are certainly gonna write down that there are vertical asymptotes and they both are coming from factors that have a power one which means they're odd and we're ready to go so we've looked at it we've said what we're checking for is where our rational function is above zero positive or above the x-axis or on the x-axis that's what we're looking for we find out firstly where this intersects so we're using just a numerator but that's only because we have a zero we're in general finding out where this crosses this because that is where these functions can be above and change to below is where they intersect since that is a function itself y equals zero that is the x-axis uh we're figuring out where this touches or crosses that that's where we can change from being above to below or below to above and that's what inequality is talking about we also talk about vertical asymptotes that's also where we can change because we have this sort of enormous gap between one infinity and the other where we can just immediately jump up there we don't really jump it's just where the function is but that's where we can change from being above or below the x-axis at well or above and below that function whatever that is so we've done that we found our x-intercept we found our two vertical asymptotes and we're ready to put this on the x-axis and so we put everything in order we don't have to have it to scale that it's fine all we need to know is what you have in order and what they are so we want to identify that that's an x-intercept and we put balance to represent that or touch is fine we know that that is an x-intercept because we put that word we know these are both verbal asymptotes and they're also odd so i don't have a great picture in my head of what this looks like this well i guess we can this has a horizontal asymptote at one this right here is a bounce somehow this is a vertical asymptote and a vertical asymptote with opposite infinities in some way shape or form and so what we're going to do is we're going to put up here one interval one testing number that determines whether this interval represents values that are outputs that are above zero or below zero so i'm going to plug in zero somewhere in here there's a zero so i evaluate for zero we're going to do this off to the side so zero plus five over zero squared minus four zero plus five squared is twenty five 25 divided by zero squared minus four well that's negative four uh 25 divided by negative four i really don't care what that actually is i just care whether it's above or below that number since that's zero this is a negative negatives are not above zero values are below zero so that's false that means that every single value in this interval because we've determined where this function can possibly change signs can possibly change from being above or below that function we determine that as an any x-intercept or any intercept in general or vertical asymptotes so we have all those so we can't change anywhere else that means that every single input in this interval is going to give you the same signed output either all positive or all negative this interval is going to give you all negative outputs that's not what we're looking for so this is false and now we work looks like f sub zero let's just plug in zero so and now we look at at just our really our multiplicity if it's odd then we keep the same truth on the other interval if it's even sorry we flip the truth on the other interval if it's even we keep the same truth so this is a false interval what this means is that this means that every single input in here is giving you a negative output we were looking for positive we don't want the negatives but this says hey you have an opposite infinity so picture this in your head this false means that all your inputs are negative this had to be going to negative infinity but an odd vertical asymptote says okay if you went from negative to negative infinity there you're coming from positive infinity because that's an odd vertical asymptote that's got to be coming from up here that means that every single one of these input inputs in this interval is giving you a positive output it has to be above zero it's going to be an opposite truth and it will never change from that because there are no more vertical asymptotes there are no more x-intercepts we have them all so we can trust in this this says this is true well the same logic works here says that this is an odd vertical asymptote now if there's no x-intercept in here this probably does this that's just the picture of the graph but that's odd what that means is that if this is if this is containing all negative outputs and that's a odd vertical asymptote then this has to be an opposite infinity again well that means that all of these inputs are yielding a positive output odd change your truth now the last one this is a bounce so a bounce says hey if all of these inputs are giving you positive outputs and you're bouncing you're not crossing it you're not changing your sign then all of these inputs are also going to be positive outputs it's going to have the same truth so you can picture this as coming down and bouncing and that's about what that graph looks like there'd be two vertical asymptotes one kind of funny one then a vertical asymptote and a bounce that's what it looks like it's kind of kind of interesting so and we see this we saw this in the last example that if you have odd multiplicity your truth is going to be opposite on that whatever x-intercept or vertical asymptote you have that has that odd multiplicity if you have even multiplicity this is included for vertical asymptotes your truth will stay the same and so that's very important to keep that in mind if you don't feel confident with that you can plug in some numbers you can try something like 3 that'd be fine plug in 3 you're going to get 64 over 5. 64 over 5 i don't care what it is it's positive that's greater than zero that would be true that's what we're looking for is greater than or equal to zero the same thing here like negative three well negative three is going to give you uh two squared that's four over five but it's still positive it's four-fifths positive negative six same thing you get negative one squared is one over 36 minus four that's 32 132 that's also positive this right here is going to be positive so all of those inputs are giving you positive outputs and that's what we were looking for all right so now it's time to draw the interval for it so we're just going to list out all of the all of the true intervals that we have so our true intervals go from negative infinity all the way up to well wait a second we're looking for above the x or on the x which is included in this x-intercept because that is because we identified that it was an x-intercept so we're going to go from negative infinity all the way to negative 2. a lot of students they ask what about the negative five well what's that do if you had to well just think about this for a second if you wrote this as three different intervals you'd do negative infinity to negative 5 but you would include it because it's an x intercept and then you'd say oh yes but i'm also including negative 5 all the way up to negative 2. and this right here is redundant this says this interval includes negative five oh yeah this interval also includes negative five wait a minute if your two intervals that you're separating include the same value wouldn't you just have the same interval from negative negative two and that's what we think of that as you know i'm going to leave that for just now rewriting so we know that we have positive outputs for all the inputs from negative infinity up to negative 2. now can we include negative 2 i know we want to no because that's a vertical asymptote that's why we write that and then again from 2 which is also a vertical asymptote so we use parentheses for vertical asymptotes there's never a time when we include that to infinity that is the interval of inputs that are going to give you outputs that are above this and that's what we're looking for or intersect that that are on that now what would happen if i didn't have this what would that do if we didn't have that then what would happen is we would have to disinclude any x-intercepts that we have since this is true true but there's an x-intercept we have to break up that first interval so this 2 to infinity that would be fine but here we'd say you know oh man we can't include the x-intercept it says not to we do negative infinity to negative five negative 5 to negative 2 and we would disinclude that with some parentheses i hope that makes sense i hope that you're seeing i'm probably over talking the graphing but i wanted you to see that i want you to see that hey all variable aspects really do this even does this we'll get that in the next one because i'll change it for you we'll talk about it for a second bouncies and crosses they matter they matter but really what it comes down to is put everywhere your function can possibly change from above to below that other function so we set them equal and we find vertical asymptotes those that's the two things we do that's all the places where these functions can change from being above to below one another we put those in order we just look at our our multiplicity odd means opposite truth for x-intercepts or vertical asymptotes even means same truth for r for vertical asymptotes or x-intercepts we just need to identify which is which so we don't include the wrong points let's do our last one before we move on to deal with a non-zero other function or non-zero function on the other side of our inequality now this one has a zero what it's asking is the same as the last example where is this rational function above the x-axis whereas this russian function above that function or on that function where the intersect so step one find out where these functions intersect by setting them equal to one another so this equal to that now because that's zero the denominator has no bearing on where these two functions intersect it's all about the numerator which is why we took the shortcut here and what i showed you in the last example so we say because that's zero i'm going to set my numerator equal to whatever that function is because my denominator would be cancelled out anyway you multiply both sides by x minus 1 times x plus 1 and it would cancel because 0 times that would give you back 0. so numerator equal to 0 is find out where they intersect i'm going to start using that phrase instead of x-intercepts because what an x-intercept is is where this intersects that where that function intersects the horizontal line that we call the x-axis which has a value of f of x or y equals zero that's what we're doing so in the next couple examples we'll see that where we're finding the intersections so where these intersect is where they are equal and where they're equal we can use the zero product property and set every function every factor that has an x in it equal to zero now x equals zero that's great and it actually has a power one so we know that this is an x-intercept at x equals zero and it's also a cross i'm going to jump over here x minus 2 equals 0 says yeah x equals 2 and we know that because that factor has a power 1 that's odd multiplicity this is also a cross the x squared minus or sorry plus one don't make something happen that that won't give you x-intercepts don't make a mistake by accidentally factoring this x squared plus one is not a difference of squares it does not factor it's not giving you anything it's an irreducible quadratic and it will not tell you any more x-intercepts than you already have on the board right now if it was x squared minus one yeah sure then we'd factor it and we would get two additional x-intercepts but we don't have that we have two x-intercepts they're both crosses and that's that's what we need to understand about that now we're also going to find vertical asymptotes because the only places where a function can change from above to below another function is where they intersect and where you have a vertical asymptote so we take this on our denominator and we set it equal to zero understanding that anywhere my denominator equals zero i have a vertical asymptote in these cases so we have x equals 1 and x equals negative 1. and we're going to look back at our factors and the exponents that they have we know that these are both vertical asymptotes and they're both odd multiplicity and so we're going to put those on our x-axis represented by that number line and we're going to determine one interval by testing the point and then use opposite infinities pretty much everywhere because these are all odd multiplicity so opposite infinities opposite signs for our crosses and our our asymptotes counter respectively okay so we have these are all jumbled up now so we need to be very careful i know x equals negative one is a vertical asymptote that has odd multiplicity and then we look at x equals zero that's an x-intercept i want to cross x equals 1 that's a vertical asymptote with odd multiplicity and then x equals 2 that's an x-intercept i'm going to put a cross again now in your head you should be looking at this going i didn't know what the picture looks like but i do know that every one of these five intervals is going to alternate truth because all of these multiplicities are odd if you feel more comfortable putting odd for your multiplicities you can but be careful the reason why i put cross or balance is so in my head i understand that is an x-intercept i put vertical asymptote and odd that's the odd is another clue to me that i'm not dealing with x-intercept i'm dealing with a vertical asymptote i can't include it that's why i do that so we just have to test one interval you can test them all if you want to it doesn't really matter i'm going to test this i want to plug in the first integer that seems easy to me so i can't plug in zero or one i'm gonna plug in three so i'm gonna plug in three make sure i understand where that's at that's here i'm gonna evaluate for three in my original inequality so this would be oh that's a lot of threes so three times three squared plus one times three minus two divided by three minus one times three plus one now it looks like we have a lot of work to do but i do want you to understand that i don't really care about the output if we were graphing i would what let me say a different way i don't care exactly what my output is i only care in relation to what that is and so what i'm going to do is i'm going to plug in 3 but i'm going to think that's a positive that's a positive that's a positive oh my numerator is positive that's a positive that's a positive huh my denominator because i'm multiplying two positives is also positive a positive divided by positive is always a positive it's always greater than zero what that means is this has to be true that means that every input in this interval is giving you an output that makes this true that is an output that's positive or above the x axis above whatever that function is now if it makes more sense to you to figure out that this is 30 over 8 and go up that's positive that's fine too it doesn't really matter that's really the only math we got to do if we understand about the the odd multiplicity then we should understand that if this is true and that's a cross if this is above the x axis this is below and that's not what i'm looking for we should understand that if this is below the x-axis and a vertical asymptote that has odd multiplicity that this interval has an odd multiplicity vertical asymptote where it's on the other side so say it again if this does this this one does this because it's odd multiplicity that would be above the x-axis and true but wait a minute there's an x-intercept so this would be above the x-axis but then cross it because it's a cross so this is above then this interval is below but likewise on this this is an odd vertical asymptote if this is below the x-axis on an odd vertical asymptote this has to be above our truth alternates like we would expect it and we're just going to write out those three intervals that we have so the first one says the intervals that are causing me to have outputs that are true in this inequality that are greater than zero or whatever that function is are from negative in phase negative one not including that negative 1. even though it says equals i know that's a vertical asymptote i've written that down then from 0 to 1 not including the 1 because of a vertical asymptote but yes including the 0 because that is an x intercept and those are included i should say that's a point where these functions intersect and the point where they are equal or intersect is included and likewise from 2 to infinity i include the 2 because we're talking about including where these functions intersect and 2 is one of those that's why we label it as a cross that's where these functions cross and that's the idea so this is the uh the interval of inputs for which give you which gives you some outputs that are greater than or equal to whatever that function is and that's the idea so i hope it makes sense i hope i've explained it well enough for you to understand i'm going to come back with two more examples of what happens if you don't have a zero so one equal to a constant and one where we have two functions we'll see in a minute just kidding i thought of something as i was right after the other example that i wanted to tell you and i forgot to tell you so number one if this equals was not there then all we would have to do is put parentheses for our x-intercepts the zero and the two and we'd be all set the other thing though what happens if you have a vertical asymptote with even multiplicity we don't see them very often here but we certainly can't have them it doesn't make it any more challenging we just have to understand our truth and so what we're gonna do is we're gonna say okay if that had an even multiplicity what would happen here well our x minus one would have an even multiplicity our x plus one would be a vertical asymptote and still have odd so x minus one that'd still be a vertical asymptote odd we still have an x equals zero cross we didn't change that x e x equals one vertical asymptote this would be even and that x equals 2 would still have a cross so how does that change everything plug in a value now let's see what happens we can still try 3 and if we evaluate for 3 greater than greater than equal to doesn't matter what we're doing uh if we evaluate for three we're still going to get a positive over a positive and that's still going to be a positive that's still true but when we test this out true with an odd multiplicity is false but false with an even multiplicity makes this one also false remember these don't always have to alternate here's what would happen if this is above the x-axis this will cross here and be below but if this is below for a vertical asymptote and this is even this is starting from below this is all negative outputs here and odd multiplicity says we're going to cross so below to above and an odd vertical asymptote says above oh now you're negative infinity that's false so our truth is kind of switched a little bit this is no longer true in fact we have an interval negative one to zero and if you're including where we are crossing this function intersecting this function then we would dis include the vertical asymptote we would include that x-intercept but then this interval no longer works as well but we still have that 2 to infinity so we get from negative infinity to 0 we go from 2 to infinity we're including our x-intercepts because it told us to include where these two functions intersect if that was not there we just drop our brackets and use parentheses so i hope that makes sense i hope you're seeing that those the multiplicity for a vertical asymptote is huge it's just like the x-intercept now we've seen both of those in practice so in the future you can kind of expect that just find your x-intercept or find out your where they intersect find out whether you have a cross or a bounce find your vertical asymptote even or odd the truth will swap for odd multiplicity and stay the same for even now we're ready to move on all right just two more examples but we have to have them because what happens if we want to figure out where a function is greater than or equal to another function that's not zero that's not y equals zero well the same logic happens i've been trying to prepare us our minds for this moment right now but it's a little more involved and the reason is is because when you find where a function intersects zero the denominator cancels zero times anything's still zero when you try to figure out where a function intersects a non-zero function your denominator does not cancel you literally find intersections so the same logic has happened i need you to see that i need to see for the first three examples we set the numerator equal to zero because we were just finding out where the function crossed or touched or intersected the x-axis now we're going to figure out where our function intersects this other function it doesn't have to be zero same logic denominator just doesn't disappear on you so we have to have it so step number one find the intersection set them equal and solve it this is where potentially one function could change from being above to below or below to above another or maybe it doesn't but that's where it would happen the only place where it would happen is where the intersection we find that first the next thing is we still find a vertical asymptote if it has one so that also could change where we're above one function two below or vice versa above to below to above if we have a vertical asymptote so those are only possibilities intersections vertical asymptotes exactly the last three it's just our denominator is not going to cancel out here so we do that we have our x-axis again and we're going to figure out what intervals work the same things i taught you in the first three examples hold true here so let's go ahead let's set these equal we're going to find out where these two functions intersect so instead of just the numerator equals 2 we have the entire function again that's not what we're doing what we're doing here is we're saying i want to figure out where these two functions intersect because that's where we could change from one being above to below the other or above to above below to above all those things we set them equal the reason why we have the denominator is because that number's not zero if that was zero we wouldn't even have to have the denominator but now as we see this remember with zero with 0 we multiplied both sides by x plus 2 and it didn't matter we saw we talked about that a little bit ago but now with 2 when i multiply both sides by x plus 2 wow it certainly matters the left hand side is great we get 3x minus 5. well on the right-hand side it's not just zero so i can't set the numerator equal to two because what we're really talking about is x two x plus four and this is something that's very easy to solve you'll notice right away though we don't have the zero product property because we don't have a zero this is something you're gonna have to take the time to solve so get everything on one side if you have a power greater than one or if you have a power that equals one so just linears get rid of your largest value of x and solve it so we know at x equals 9 these two functions are going to intersect that's important the only other thing we've got to do is also figure out any vertical asymptote so this was the intersect point the point of intersection this is just like the x-intercept except you're not talking about the x-axis that's that's it it's all you got to do so now our vertical asymptote would be if x plus 2 equals 0 we're going to have one of those it's a vertical asymptote it came from a factor that had a power 1 so we're still going to put odd just like we're still going to put cross for that because it's coming from a factor that is power one so let's draw our number line and see what happens so we know what we're dealing with we're going to plug in one value we're going to plug in zero and we're going to evaluate in our original inequality so let's do that if we evaluate for zero that's three times zero over zero plus two so three times zero that's zero minus five that's negative five negative five halves is negative two and a half less than or equal to two yes it is that's true zero is i'm sorry um zero gives us a value that's negative negatives are all less than two so this is true use your multiplicity if this is true and that's an odd this has to be false and if this is true and that's an odd this also has to be false for some reasons that we've already talked about you can think through the same thing the only difference here is that this is not zero this is at two it's a horizontal line at two so where they cross one could change from above to below from above or above sorry below to above from below two to above two where we're looking for below two so it's asking where's this function below the value of 2 between here and here all of these inputs are going to give you an output that is below 2. all of these outputs because this is where it crosses it's going to give you outputs that are above 2. well this is odd vertical asymptote if this is below 2 then this one would be above 2. it's not even going to intersect it we know that because it would have shown up somewhere else so that doesn't happen uh if you look at it carefully this has a horizontal asymptote at three three over one would give you three it's a horizontal asymptote three this never makes it back down to two it can't ever be below uh below two again because it's always above two that should be interesting to you so this is this is the only true interval that we have negative two to nine we're still never going to include anything from a vertical asymptote now we are going to include any sort of intersection point if we're told to if not if that wasn't there we'd have a parenthesis and that is about it the same thing is going to work in the next example all right last one we're going to find out where this function is greater than or equal to this function well there's only two places where these can change from one being on top the other one being on top and that is where they intersect and vertical asymptotes so where the intersect is you set an equal idea so let's set these equal we've done it every other time it's just with the zero you only need the numerator to set to find the point of intersection here we can't do that we set them equal to one another and then we have these um this idea that where they intersect is where they could potentially change from one above to to not being above our intervals would change and so what we're going to find these points of intersection by set them equal we'll solve them in this case we have a proportion we can cross multiply that's fine i want to tell you there are some other ideas on how to solve this sometimes you'll see a textbook say get everything on one side get 0 on the other side that's fine in those cases you typically have to find a common denominator change some fractions around it's not really harder but it is something that that we can do on the previous example that would have meant subtracting 2 and finding the common denominator and we could we could see that we could see if we did that if you subtracted two and got zero then you'd have to take the time to find a common denominator combine some like terms but you do see exactly what happens hey there's our 9. that's our only x-intercept there's our negative 2 that's our only vertical asymptote and that's exactly what we saw on that number line from the last example so you can do it that way here it's a little more involved you get everything on one side i'll show that to you in a minute that's the other option is it worth doing is a common question it just depends on what you what you you prefer uh me personally i think it's easier just to solve this and find the points of intersection and get my vertical asymptotes separately they're not going to change you're never going to get away from that vertical asymptotes it doesn't really matter what does matter is definitely finding the point of of intersection so 3 times x minus 3 and 5 times x plus 1 if we distribute and we solve this so we're going to subtract 3x and subtract 5. and we know that that is a point of intersection of those two functions and it's across it doesn't have a power to that that power says one so we know that's an odd multiplicity that's a cross vertical asymptotes all we've got to do is look at our original function our vertical asymptotes are going to occur when x minus three equals zero or when x plus one equals zero and because they're both coming from factors that have a power one they're odd they're gonna have opposite infinities um what would happen if you wanted to do it differently what would happen if you said you know i really prefer dealing with zero so i'm going to subtract my three over x plus one that's totally fine but notice you are going to have to spend the time to make one fraction so what's going to happen when we make one fraction you will do exactly what you've just done right here so you'll take this and say all right i would multiply it by x minus 3 over x minus 3 and x plus 1 over x plus 1 and you would get 5 x plus 5 minus 3 x well it depends it depends on how you write this typically what we would do is we would make sure that we have this on one fraction first or use parentheses here and distribute in just a moment you don't want to put minus 9. it's going to be plus 9. be very careful with that our denominators though are common and if you distribute and combine some like terms and say hey now that's still zero well let's think about it this changes it to what we just did right just did it like well not just it like 25 minutes ago now we've just done it we can see it we can see that this is just what we've done if this is now the x-axis this is it that's that function now that's zero then this would give us an x-intercept all right or in general where they intersect so subtract 14 that's negative 14 divided by 2 that's negative 7. same exact negative 7 that we have it's still a cross that would still be a power 1 from where we're getting that this is a vertical asymptote in every case hey this is 1 that's power 1. that's an odd vertical for a glass of total 3 and a negative one it's the same idea pick the one that's easiest to you do you like seeing the zero fine that's fine but you're going to take some time to do that you'll have to find a common denominator distribute combine some like terms but finding the x-intercept can be a lot easier and the vertical asymptotes are right there kind of smacking the face so that that's okay if you like this way that's also okay but you have to spend the time to find the point of intersection either way works it doesn't really matter the key is that you need to find that point of intersection whether you have it originally or whether you call this change it so that you have the x axis that's okay you also need to identify your vertical asymptotes or whether they're even wrong so the same stuff happens either way works what we get out of it is that there are three points three x values i'll say because those points would change depending on what function you're talking about whether it's 0 or 3 times 3 over x plus 1. those x values are where we can change from one function being above or below than the other function so we're going to put those up here we have negative 7 negative one and three we know the last two are vertical asymptotes whichever method you use you see it's the same they're both odd and x equals negative 7 is an x-intercept and it's a cross so that's only one we have that's an x-intercept we're going to plug in a zero so plug in zero if you can or an easier number if you can't we're going to plug in zero and we're going to see what happens we evaluate this in the original inequality you can evaluate it here as well that's fine so we do both if you want to if we plug in 0 we'll get 14 over let's see 0 that's 14 negative 3 times 1 is negative 3. 14 over negative 3 is a negative number negative numbers are not bigger than 0. that means that this is false if you plugged in 0 here this would be five over negative three this would be positive three over one negative five thirds is not bigger than three so either way you go you get the same truth in this case it's false there's if you plug in any input between here and here what's going to happen is that this function will not be greater than that function and that's what we're talking about or this function will not be above zero that's what we're looking for so let's see that's false if that's odd this is true if that's odd this is true if that's odd this is false you can test some values if you want to to feel more confident plug in something like negative two four negative eight and you'll get the same exact truth that we just got and that's the idea so what we understand is that on these two intervals from negative seven to negative one and then again from three to infinity we have inputs that are going to give us outputs which cause this function to be greater than or equal to this one to be bigger than it or to be intersecting with it or this function to be above the x-axis and so we're going to say all right let's include our x-intercept let's dis-include our vertical asymptotes so including the negative seven sure it says that we can include the point of intersection but never a vertical asymptote never heard of asymptote never infinity if that were not an equals if that were just a greater than we would just make that a parenthesis and we'd be good to go i hope i've explained this in such a way that you see the similarity between these inequalities that have functions and constants and the ones that have zero we can always change it to having a zero that's fine but sometimes we don't have to this seems like it's a little bit less work we just have to understand the idea when you're setting the numerator equal to zero you're finding the point of intersection of your graph and another well your two functions uh the one on the left side of the inequality and on the right side whether that's zero or something else then x-intercepts of vertical asymptotes and use that multiplicity to determine whether you have the same truth on two sides of a vertical asymptotic intercept with even or opposite truth with an odd so that's about it we're now done with this uh this idea of using polynomials and rationals we did everything i can think of um after this we're going to start talking about composition of functions and then some exponentials and logarithms so that's the second to last thing that we want to talk about in uh in this series this short series and we'll talk about trigonometry after that so we're on a roll i hope you're enjoying it i hope this is making sense to you have a great day you
