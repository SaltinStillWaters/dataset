Transcript for: Finding Intersections of Functions (Precaluclus - College Algebra 22)
hi welcome to another video so this would be pretty quick this is just about finding the intersection of two functions so I need to tell you how to do that show you what it is that we're doing what we're finding and that you should it should end with well an ordered pair because when two functions intersect we get a point so that's what we're going to talk about this video so we have just three examples if you've ever asked to find the intersection of two functions well what we want to do is set those functions equal so if the functions are the output of some set of some an algebraic expression where we plug in a number get an output if we set our outputs equal so basically this gives us an output this is the output we set them equal we find out what X values will take to give the equal outputs and by doing that we find out the points of intersection on two functions so in other words just so equal so we're gonna say hey when this function equals this function we're gonna have an intersection and so we do that now what we're finding what this really is if you think about it this is a parabola that's upward opening and this is a constant which is a horizontal line so really what we're finding on some parabola and some horizontal line if those things intersect it will be found by saving the functions equal and we'll find the points of intersection at X comma Y so we we set the function equal saying hey we want the Y vice or outputs to be the same find X this said the x-values that give us those equal outputs and that's going to give us the points where the x's are the same and Y is the same in both of our functions so when we do that we're gonna see some things that are really familiar so we're gonna see stuff that seems like it's from might may be intermediate algebra when you set functions equal to another you look at what I do to solve that well with anything power 2 or higher one of the best things we have is factoring or using some of the rational zeros properties we have later on what we do is we get everything at one side we get it in order we the first term positive I know this sounds familiar and then we try to factor it or use a screw manthe or if we can't do those things we quadratic formula so we want to get everything on one side in order first term positive and zero on the other side so that the zero product property works if we can factor it or quadratic formula works as we can so we'd subtract three and I want you to understand what happens when we do that I'm gonna write this a little funny I want you to notice my original parabola is this x squared plus 6x plus 3 it's got a y-intercept of 3 look at 0 you see that now what happens when I subtract the 3 disgustin basically it shifts this parabola down and it says alright if you shift this parabola down the original parabolas subtract 3 would shift it down 4 units by finding the x intercepts of this function it's like finding the intersection of these two functions so if we it's kind of difficult to think of where this problem crosses the y equals 3 line of G of x equals 3 but if I shift it down 3 units and think well you know what just shifting the struggle it down so that it's kind of sitting on the x axis the X intercepts are very easy to find so if I find any x intercepts of this function we inherently find out the x-values where these two phones to intersect the y-value see how we have to plug it in our X's but this will give us at least the x-values where our functions are going to intersect by finding the x intercepts of a shifted down parabola now how we solve it number one we'd always try to the square root method and it's not going to work because we can't isolate a power 2 without getting the X on the other side but we can do the next step would be factor remember that we can always factor a GCF if one exists here it does we factored X and because we got everything on one side we have a zero on the right hand side the zero product property works says yeah we got a couple factors set e 2202 problem every factor that has a variable gets set equal to zero and we get two solutions we x equals zero of course and subtract six we hit x equals negative six not now listen carefully what this is what this represents these represent the x-intercepts for this function like because you set it equal to zero but what it also represents is the x-values where this function and this function intersect so this will intersect at x equals zero and x equals negative six well we want to do is go a little bit further we want to take those values and find the ordered pairs of intersection where the points you're trying to find a point here of where these two graphs intersect so what we're going to be able to say you know what from the x equals zero and x equals negative six we should be able to plug those into one of our functions or both of our punches if you actually want to check your work and see that this actually gives us what we want so we're gonna create an ordered pair 0 comma some number and negative 6 comma some number because that will be our points of intersection from our graph stemming from the fact that we found the x-intercepts of Meshuga down parabola if we plug in 0 here we get 0 squared plus 6 times 0 0 plus 3 is 3 you know wait a minute can I just plug in 0 here and get 3 yeah that's all the point right that's a that's a constant so where this parabola would intersect this constant of 3 would have to be at a y-value of 3 in fact we could just put 3 here we know it's going to intersect at something comma 3 because that's the only place a horizontal line that's on the output of a horizontal line is 3 in this case now what I did though is I check my work so I plug in 0 and said all right 0 plus 0 plus 3 is 3 this is also 3 that's how you check your work to make sure you have the correct intersection plug in your x value to both functions and it needs to be the same that tells you that that one x value gives you the same output on both functions that has to be a common point between the two and therefore an intersection try negative 6 negative 6 squared is positive 36 and 6 times negative 30 negative 6 is negative 36 36 plus negative 36 plus 3 three also we play them here well there's no place to plug it in it's what's called a constant and you get three so we know that these two points are the two points of intersection of this parabola and that horizontal line that's what we are doing when we're setting two functions equal is refining the points of intersection that's how you do it okay let's move on a little bit we have two other functions here we've got f of x equals negative two x squared plus one we've got G of x equals three X plus two before we go and find the intersection I want to understand what we're doing you need to know what that shape sort of looks like you need to recognize it is a parabola it's power - but it's downward opening so this graph looks like this somewhere on an XY coordinate plane I don't really care right now we're going to find the points of intersection but I just want to get the picture together what you're doing this function is that a parabola doesn't have a power to what it does have is a slope and y-intercept this isn't slope-intercept form it has a wider set of two it's got a slope of 3 so this is some sort of climbing functions climbing line it's a long line because it has a sloping line except it's in that linear equation form if this intersects that's about where it's gonna go to be so we're going to intersect this is a downward-opening problem with some sort of a line and that's exactly what we're finding how to find that they've set the functions equal so we'd have negative 2x squared plus 1 equals 3x plus 2 from here yeah we don't need to keep the same nature of what these are I don't really care that it's a parabola and a line this is what you're finding this is what you're going to know when you solve this but how to solve it doesn't care about keeping these forms in order to solve this we're basically you're gonna change this to a different problem find out what where that parabola crosses the x-axis and then those x-intercepts are going to represent the x coordinates of the points like we did the previous example so what I mean by all that is managed do the same thing we've been doing let's get everything on one side let's get it in order let's get the first term positive let's see the square root method works if not let's see if we can factor if so great we're gonna be able to fact this if not we use the quadratic formula but in all those cases you want zero on one side first now let's see if Procrit I should move the stuff from the right to the left or the stuff from the left to the right well it seems better to move the things from the left to the right so that our first term becomes positive we want the x squared term to be the first term because it has the largest power so if we add two x squared and subtract one so adding 2x squared and 2x squared subtracting one we get one now we have this set up to look like a differently yes this is an upward-opening parabola and set equals zero it's finding x-intercepts but because we set this equal this stemmed from this idea the aect as we get here even though they represent x-intercepts for this function they'll represent intersection values of x for these two functions so we sold it the same exact way square root method not gonna work Factory yeah the factory is gonna work we know that we'd have 3 and 2 times 1 gives us 2 we're adding to 3 or multiplying the two they both have to be positive they have to be 2 of 1 so that adds a 3 multiply C to I love the shortcut for this at this point in our factoring lives we can use pretty much anything we want I like doing the shortcut and simplifying I showed this to you in another video one factor here will be look at your denominator you don't understand one factor will have one X and then you add one this fraction says the number says you'll have two x's in one factor and you'll add one also we learned that if we just change these signs it will give us our X values you can do that to the factory in itself isn't really valuable for us right now it's just getting us those X values of our intersection points so the zero product property means that these equal to zero we'll subtract one we'll subtract one and divide by two and we noticed that's exactly what we get here this is the value one if I change the sign that's negative one here's one half change of sign that's negative one half that's great we can totally do that if you don't need to show your factory you can go directly from here to the values of your suit the x-values of your points of intersection now there is one thing that we want to make sure that we do we don't want to leave it just as next values whenever you find in intersections we want to leave them as points who want to get the point here so to do that I'm going to plug in negative one I'm going to do it to both of my functions why is that necessary no but it's a good idea so that we can check our work so if I plug in negative one negative one squared is positive 1 positive 1 times negative 2 it's going to give us a negative two negative two plus one is negative one if I take negative one the same value plug it in here three times negative one is negative three plus two is negative one so I took this one x value I plugged it into both of my functions just to make sure that that gave me the same output that totally verifies that this is a point of intersection for both of our functions so this is it looks like this point on our on our graph let's plug in negative one half if we plug in negative 1/2 negative 1/2 to both of our functions negative 1/2 times 3 is negative 3 halves plus 2 is positive 1/2 now we better get the same thing if we plug in negative 1/2 to our x value here negative 1/2 squared is positive 1/4 1/4 times negative 2 is negative 1/2 plus 1 is positive 1/2 so we know that this value plug into both of our functions gives us 1/2 that's the other point of intersection so let's see that would look something like scales a little off but plug in negative one get up negative one plug in negative one half get up positive one half that's about where that function crosses the other function where those two functions intersect the x and y axes aren't exactly right we're kind of showing you a a very loose visual interpretation of what's going on that's the downward-opening parabola this is that positive slope in line and we're finding where those things cross do it in kind of a cool way so let's come back we'll do we'll do one more example all right last one and then what we've got here we have two parabolas and we're trying to see where those things intersect one of them is upward opening but a little bit stretched vertical stretches to be narrow one of them is a normal sort of parabola not vertically stretched at all so we have one like this and one like that and we're going to find out these two points of intersection how we do it every time to settle and we're going to go through the same process we do for solving for every single thing that has a power two or more we're going to get everything on one side in order first term positive let's see if we can screw a method factor or quadratic formula if we have quadratics so let's get this stuff on the Left moved over to the right by adding or subtracting respectively because that has a larger coefficient we're going to do that we don't want to move this over here or first term would be negative so we're gonna subtract x squared add X and subtract 1 of course it gives us a 0 which is really nice if factoring a quadratic form is necessary we need that zero and it looks like this is going to factor but I want to talk about what if it didn't square root methods off the table here we can't do that we definitely don't want to do completing the square if we don't have to because we have some easier ways to go about doing that so factoring to be number one and we do know that this is going to factor because we can find some numbers that add to negative two and multiply to one times negative 15 that's going to be a positive 3 and negative 5 that adds to negative 2 that multiplies to negative 15 if that didn't work right now you'd be doing the quadratic formula and well you wouldn't find very nice values for your X in this case X intercepts and what we're really in the context of the problem X values of the points intersection they wouldn't be nice but they wouldn't be accurate so the quadratic formula gives us things that are sort of hard to manipulate but they are very important be able to find so if this did not factor you do quadratic formula right now and you'd have the X values from them of your points of intersection what would be awkward is trying to plug them in and find an output that's where this would get offered that's why most of the time these things are factorable so that you don't end with stuff from quadratic formula because can you imagine I'm making this up I mean what if you had like 1 plus or minus square root of 3 over 1 plus square root of 3 over 2 and 1 minus root of 3 over 2 something they could easily get from the quadratic formula how would you plug that in well you could do it but it's going to give you something very very awkward for your y-coordinate and we need to find ordered pairs our points of intersection that's it's all idea so that's why most of these are factorable is because you don't end with stuff that looks quadratic formula e in that up you know I'm gonna stuff with radicals in it essentially if it's factorable so again factoring if it's not factorable make sure you've really tried to factor if it's still not factorable then do quadratic formula you're going to end with some nasty x-values of your points of intersection plug them in anyway don't use approximations you have to use exact values unless they specifically tell you use approximations and then of course Y so for us since this is factorable we also know our a is 1 which gives us something really nice it's a great shortcut moving use maybe double check our work x squared minus 5x plus 3 is nice to X and then minus 15 said both of these equal to zero by the zero-product property and we now have the x coordinates of our points of intersection of this parabola intersecting the other one so basically our X values of this nets if we plug them in to our functions and value it our functions at these values will find the outputs that's how functions work plug in the x key down the Y that gives you an ordered pair also we notice man if we just change these signs we get the same values you can you can do that so let's take negative 3 let's plug this in we're gonna do both of them just to make sure that we're right so negative 3 squared I'm looking at f of X that gives you 9 9 minus 9 3 that's 9 plus 3 12 12 plus 1 is 13 I'm going to write it down but I'm gonna also check over here so again 3 squared is 9 9 times 2 is 18 18 plus 9 is 27 and 27 minus 14 is again 13 so I know that this value negative 3 and both of my functions gives me out 13 that verifies that that is a point of intersection now the five is the same idea take 5 plug into both f of X and G of X this is just a check your work sort of idea so 5 squared is 25 minus 5 is 20 plus 1 is 21 that should be my output in both of these cases okay so take our 5 5 into the G of X now 5 squared is 25 25 times 2 is 50 50 minus 15 is 35 and 35 minus 14 is 21 so we know that we have 5 being plugged into both of these or evaluating both functions gives us the same output and that also verifies that the point of intersection so this is it these are the two points where one parabola crosses the other parabola that's what we're finding movie sets you folks just equal to another and that is how we find points of intersection of basically any two functions here we were just dealing with quadratics or things that turn out to be quadratic in the future though if you have any two functions you can set them equal to find points of intersection I hope that helps you I know it's kind of a quick video next time we'll talk about how we can use some quadratic methods for functions that quadratic and then we'll start stepping up and doing crafts of quadratics and some inequalities so I'll see you for that you
