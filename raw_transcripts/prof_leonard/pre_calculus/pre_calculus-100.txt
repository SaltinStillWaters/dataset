Transcript for: Proving the Double and Half Angle Formulas for Trigonometry (Precalculus - Trigonometry 27)
hey there welcome to another video so in this video we're going to talk about how to prove the double and half angle formulas that you're going to use a lot of especially when you get to calculus 2. so some of these formulas they look kind of like whoa where are we going to do that and then you get to calc 2 and they'll come back and so i'm going to show you how to prove them we're going to walk through those proofs right now after that what we're going to do is on a different video just just use them figure out how they're how they're used some proofs get some more identities out of that and then deal with some equations involving some double angle and half angle formula so let's get right into it the first thing we're going to do is acknowledge that a lot of these formulas that we've already had can be used to make more formulas if you use an identity to make another identity you kind of get two for one and so what we're going to do is use like the the sum and difference formulas for sine and for cosine over tangent to develop these double angle formulas and here's the thought process if this is the sum formula for sine so sum of those two angles and we know what that equals what if we just called alpha and beta the same angle so instead of sine of alpha plus beta maybe it's sine of theta plus theta well what's theta plus theta theta plus theta would be two theta or double some angle and it'll give us a formula so we're going to do that right now so suppose for this sum formula for sine that we just do that we say instead of sine alpha plus beta we have sine theta plus theta what would that do instead of alpha and beta in the rest of this formula because alpha is replaced by theta and beta is replaced by theta both the first and the second angle are just theta so all of these would be theta now we know what sine of alpha or theta plus theta is that's sine of two theta but check this out we would have sine theta cosine theta plus cosine theta sine theta we know that when we have multiplication the two factors that we have are commutative so cosine theta sine theta is the same thing as sine theta cosine theta so what that means is that this and this are identical so we have 2 sine theta cosine theta so sine of two theta equals this is sine theta cosine theta this is sine theta cosine theta so add them up and basically combine like terms we get two sine theta cosine theta and that's it that's our very first double angle formula it's the only one that we have for sine we're actually going to get three of them for cosine but for sine of two theta this is it this is all we get for our double angle formula so that's if you have sine two theta this is the one that you're going to use and you are going to see this an awful lot in calculus two we often times go from here to here sometimes we go from here to here now let's give it a try with cosine alpha plus beta we're going to deal with the same thing we're going to think well if i want a double angle formula instead of alpha plus beta let's just consider them to be the same like theta and theta that would give us cosine of two theta and in the same fashion that we just did if alpha and beta are both the same angle let's call it theta then all of these angles will be replaced with theta as well this is the sum formula for cosine but now that we have the same angle we have cosine theta cosine theta sine theta sine theta so we're just replacing alpha and beta with the same angle so that we can get something like that cosine of 2 theta and all of these will be replaced so cosine alpha cosine beta says cosine of the first angle cosine of the second angle well both of our angles are theta now so cosine theta cosine theta same thing for here sine theta sine theta and really conveniently we see that cosine theta times cosine theta is cosine squared theta we know that when we multiply something times itself we get an exponent of two cosine theta cosine theta gives us cosine squared theta and remember when we write that we write the cosine with the power two and then the theta but it represents cosine theta in parenthesis the whole quantity squared so left-hand side we're going to have that cosine 2 theta on the right hand side we get cosine squared minus sine squared theta that right there is one of three double angle formulas for cosine so we're going to manipulate this a little bit but that's the very first one how in the world are we going to manipulate well we can do a few things knowing what cosine squared theta and sine squared theta are by the pythagorean identity so so we can change this around a little bit and get get kind of three for one so let's take a look at what sine squared theta is i hope you remember that i hope you remember that the pythagorean identity simply says sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta equals 1. if we solve for sine squared theta by subtracting cosine squared theta we get 1 minus cosine squared theta at the same time we could have subtracted sine squared they didn't got cosine squared theta is 1 minus sine squared theta we could have done that as well let's use this one right now what we're going to do is we're going to take this double angle formula that we've already made from our sum formula for cosine so then those are the same this has to be cosine squared minus sine squared but let's go ahead and substitute if sine squared theta is 1 minus cosine squared we know that by the pythagorean identity let's take this and replace it with that so instead of cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta we've replaced sine squared theta with one minus cosine squared theta because of the pythagorean identity it's really important to have those parentheses because our signs are going to change and if we combine some like terms man we got a cosine squared theta cosine squared theta that's 2 cosine squared theta minus 1. that's the second of the double angle formulas for cosine so cosine 2 theta you could use cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta that's the one i'm going to use most often but you could also use this cosine 2 theta is also equal to this identity that's another double angle formula for cosine now we can also do the same thing or something very similar by solving this for cosine squared theta and replacing this piece with whatever that equals so let's try that now so instead of solving for sine squared theta let's solve for cosine squared theta so this was option one but if we subtract sine squared theta from both sides from here we get cosine squared that equals 1 minus sine squared theta we've used that many times before but now let's use it to create another formula for this i've gone ahead and just written this again so this is the same exact formula but it's a little nicer to see here so we're going to replace this piece with 1 minus sine squared theta by the pythagorean identity so 1 minus sine squared theta that is cosine squared theta same thing minus sine squared theta you see something really similar happened to what we've just done we have some like terms again so we could also write cosine two theta or the double angle formula for cosine as one minus two sine squared theta those starred items that i've done here here and here those are the three double angle formulas for cosine so we use the sum formulas we said this is the only one for sine double angle formula for sine is that um but for cosine we've got a few of them because we have some some manipulations of the pythagorean identity we have one here cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta we actually saw that earlier we could have used identity this is an identity that formula counts as an identity we've changed it we said yeah we could write this as 2 cosine squared theta minus 1 or we can write this as 1 minus 2 sine squared theta so those are the three formulas double angle formulas for cosine we can also do a couple other things we can take and solve for sine squared and cosine squared and get something a little bit different some identities based on these double angle formulas so let's try that now let's take a look at this cosine 2 theta equals 2 cosine squared theta minus 1. if we solve for cosine squared theta we would add 1 and divide by 2. so cosine two theta plus one over two that would solve for cosine squared theta for us oftentimes you'll see this written as one plus cosine two theta instead of cosine two theta plus one nothing simplifies there not even the 2 and the 2 because 2 theta is the argument of cosine in order to change that you have to have some sort of identity that's what these double angle formulas actually do they allow you to change that angle into something perhaps more usable we're gonna do the same thing with with this guy so if we solve that for sine squared theta we would subtract 1 and divide by negative 2 or we could add sine squared theta subtract cosine 2 theta and then divide by 2 that's what i'm going to choose to do so i don't have to divide by a negative so i'm going to add 2 sine squared theta subtract cosine 2 theta if we do that we get 1 minus cosine 2 theta and because we added 2 sine squared theta we have that positive over here now we divide by 2 and we solve for sine squared theta and this and this are a couple of identities that we can now use so we have four new identities or formulas on the board we've got sine two theta equals two sine theta cosine theta the double angle formula for sine we've got cosine 2 theta equals one of three things cosine squared minus sine squared theta or 2 cosine squared theta minus 1 or 1 minus sine squared theta so those are the double angle formulas for cosine from there from those the last two formulas we get a couple of their identities that we use quite a bit so we're going to now get into tangent but there and i'm going to recap all this write it down for you but there's now five new formulas that we can use i guess i miscounted there are six new formulas that we can use and we're about to create two more let's look at tangent tangent of alpha plus beta is tangent alpha plus tangent beta over one minus tangent alpha tangent beta if we say yeah let's just suppose that those are the same angle then call them both theta then tangent of alpha plus beta would give you well if they're the same angle called theta tangent of theta plus theta that's two theta it'll create a double angle formula for tangent so let's go ahead and replace these two with theta giving us 2 theta and everything over there with theta saying we're still following the formula the sum formula for tangent but now if we have the same angle all those angles let us combine some like terms multiply and get a power 2 for tangent so tangent of theta plus theta equals everything would get replaced with theta tangent to the first plus tangent to the second both theta over one minus the same thing so tangent of two theta would be this is two tangent theta tangent theta plus tangent theta says yeah two of them you combine like terms two tangent theta over one minus tangent theta times tangent theta is tangent squared theta remember that when you multiply two things you to power two when you multiply trig functions that power two looks a little funny it's right above the actual function so you don't get it confused with a a squared angle it's a squared function that's why it's there so tangent squared theta means tangent theta quantity squared that's exactly we have that's the double angle formula for tangent there's only one of them but we can do something a little bit different combining some of these ideas remember that tangent equals sine over cosine so tangent squared theta would equal sine squared theta over cosine squared theta but check this out because we've already solved for something sine squared theta and cosine squared theta in an identity we can now use that these are identities they come from the formulas that we've just proved from other formulas that are proven already so we can now say yeah if you ever have sine squared theta you could certainly write it as this if you ever have cosine squared theta you could certainly write it as that no problem let's go ahead and replace that so tangent squared theta equals sine squared theta let's use this instead over cosine squared theta let's use that instead and it will create yet another identity for us now that looks kind of nasty because it's a complex fraction but if we multiply both the numerator and denominator by two two over two that's a fancy one but it's going to allow us to simplify our fraction then what we're gonna get is one minus cosine two theta over one plus cosine two theta and that gives us another formula or identity for tangent so or at least for tangent squared theta so we gain a couple other ones we have a double angle formula for tangent and we have another identity for tangent squared theta so what i'm going to do right now is talk about the half angle formulas we're going to prove those and i'm going to recap everything and show you all the formulas that you would want to have next to when you're working on some some of these next few problems okay i know i've done a lot of proofs so far and they've been pretty quick because they're they're really fairly straightforward uh from our formulas but now what we're going to do is something kind of fancy we are going to create half angle formulas from our identities that we got stemming from are double angle formulas now that sounds like a lot of words but remember we used our sum formulas to get our double angle formulas we manipulated our double angle formulas to get these three formulas for sine squared cosine squared and tangent squared theta now what we're going to do is kind of trick them a little bit we're going to let theta equal alpha over 2. now remember we've already proved these i want to prove them again we're getting something new from them so here's the idea i'm going to say let's imagine that theta is alpha over 2 half of some other angle well then if theta is alpha over 2 2 times alpha over 2 would give us just alpha the angle itself that we had a half angle of for our formula so we're going to get this formula for half an angle related to the whole thing which is much nicer to deal with that fraction then we're going to take a square root of it and have a plus and minus and the plus and minus will be determined by the quadrant of alpha over two so i'm talking about all the way through that but that's where we're heading you should know where we're going on this one because it's a it's a little bit weird so step number one we've already done it we have some formulas that we're going to manipulate and say let's let this guy be half of some other angle let's call it alpha over 2. so what would sine squared of instead of theta alpha over 2 b we'd replace theta everywhere with what we're calling theta equal to alpha over 2. that means we still have a 1 we still have this minus cosine but 2 theta is now 2 times alpha over 2. all over two well what what's that give us this gives us sine squared alpha over two but on this side we get one minus cosine your twos are going to cancel that's just cosine alpha all over two now we gotta think back if we really want to find a half angle formula for sine we got to get rid of that power 2 which means we're going to take a square root and you have to remember this that when you take a square root you've got to put a plus and minus in front of that square root that says that what you get is either positive or negative because power twos always maintain positivity means if you plug in a negative and square it you could also get a positive so we're going to do that just saying same thing with any other algebra that we do when you take a square root you've got to put the plus and minus there so power 2 square root we're gone we've got just sine of alpha over 2 equals plus or minus the square root of 1 minus cosine alpha over 2. that right there is the half angle formula for sine and you go yeah but that's really confusing because what about the plus and minus there's an important note that you really need to make the positive or negative is determined by the quadrant of alpha over two so what do i mean by that remember that sine is positive in quadrants 1 and 2 because y is positive there cosine's positive in quadrants 4 and 1 because x is positive there tangent is positive in quadrants one and three because positive over positive negative or negative give you both positive so sine is positive and quadrants one and two negative in quadrants three and four cosine is positive in quadrants 4 and 1 negative and 2 and 3. tangent's positive and quadrants 1 and 3 negative and 2 and 4. so we use that we find out where alpha over 2 is and i'll show you how to do that and wherever that angle is then you can determine sine of that angle would be positive or negative and so um we would use positive four angle over two in quadrants one or two but negative in three and four so we locate where that is to determine what sine to use for sine itself you're doing positive for one and two negative for three and four cosine we go through the same exact math we're going to take a square root after calling theta alpha over two so let's call it alpha over two so 1 plus cosine 2 theta now we're calling 2 alpha over 2. your twos are going to cancel we're going to end up getting cosine squared alpha over 2 is 1 plus cosine alpha all over 2. and the same way we did here we're going to take a square root to solve for cosine alpha over 2. we got our square root we got our plus and minus and we've just solved for the half angle formula for cosine so cosine of half of some angle equals plus or minus the square root of one plus cosine of the whole angle so twice this amount if this is half the angle this is the whole thing over two again you take the positive or the negative depending on the quadrant of alpha over two so cosine of alpha over two says cosine is going to be positive in quadrants 1 and 4 negative 2 and 3. so you locate this you determine cosine of that angle like whether it's positive or negative and then you go ahead and pick positive or negative for the square root after that so last one tangent squared theta equals one minus cosine two theta over one plus cosine two theta let's go ahead call this alpha over two then we're gonna get alpha and alpha right here we'll take a square root after that so we're just replacing theta with alpha over two that's half of some other angle because our twos cancel here which is the whole reason why we use these formulas because th that double angle cancels half an angle gives you just the angle which is nicer to work with in a lot of cases those are all gone we're going to get tangent squared alpha 2 equals 1 minus cosine alpha over 1 plus cosine alpha now we're free to go ahead and take a square root and we're going to get tangent of alpha over 2 equals plus and minus the square root of one minus cosine alpha over one plus cosine alpha and that's it that's the three half-angle formulas that we have one for sine one for cosine one for tangent in the next video i'll show you exactly how to use them right now i'm gonna come back and just have them written on the board explain which formulas are which and then we'll be done all right that's about it we've got a lot of new identities a lot of new formulas that we can use we started off by using our sum formulas for sine and cosine and tangent and we got these pretty easy we got sine cosine tangent of two theta these are the double angle formulas there's one for sine there's one for tangent there are three for cosine because we can manipulate this pythagorean identity a couple different ways that's the reason why that happens that's why we did the way we did it so this one's pretty common we use this one a lot these ones you use them not as much for sine you only have one so if you're going to use a double angle formula for sine it's got to be that for tangent it is this that's all you use for here you have options now you might be thinking well which one do i use if there's more than one it it depends on the context it really depends on what you're doing for some basic work you can use any of them any of them that you want they're going to come the same thing they are equivalent this equals this equals this how do you know that look this is manipulative pythagorean identity it's all it's doing they have to be the same so that's pretty cool from there we solved these two for cosine squared and sine squared and got two new identities so that comes from these two from tangent we just use the fact that tangent squared is sine squared over cosine squared put these in ratio we got that one and eliminated the twos from these three we took square roots and got half angle how do we get half angle we called these angles alpha over two so that smartly two times alpha over two would just give us alpha and let's deal with a usually easier angle than alpha over two so we got those half angle formulas a big note you gotta write down is the positive or negative the plus and minus is determined by the quadrant of alpha over two you look up where that is and it will determine whether sine cosine and tangent is positive or negative in that quadrant and then we pick the appropriate sign for our half-angle formulas so i hope that made sense i know it's a lot of proofs not a lot of examples i kind of like the proofs i think they're very interesting and it's it's valuable to know where this stuff comes from not just thrown at you so this is all stemming from really two ideas the sum formulas and the pythagorean identities and then just taking square roots so i hope it's made sense i hope you enjoyed it and next video we're going to talk about how you use this so we'll start with some very basic examples move on to some identities and then some equations at the end hope you're doing well
