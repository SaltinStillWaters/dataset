Transcript for: How to Convert From Rectangular Coordinates to Polar Coordinates (Precalculus - Trigonometry 38)
hey there welcome to another video in the last video i showed you how to convert between polar coordinates and rectangular coordinates of a point same point different representations in this video i'm going to teach you how to go between rectangular representation or rectangular coordinates of a point into polar so we need to be able to go both ways last video was really straightforward not easy because it was different but really straightforward because everything about changing between polar and rectangular representations of points works just fine there's never an ambiguity of where you are at in whatever quadrant your angle resides for polar and therefore there's never an ambiguity on what point you get for rectangular however in reverse there is you see here's the thing when we did all this work last time we said hey because we have a right triangle because theta can represent some sort of an angle in polar coordinates where your point is we can convert between them nicely because we have sine of theta equals y over x or y over r so y is r sine theta cosine theta is x over r so x is r cosine theta and this is how we changed from a polar coordinate into a rectangular coordinate for any point that we had very very nicely however there was two other things i gave you i hope you remember that the pythagorean theorem says x squared plus y squared equals r squared or r is square root of x squared plus y squared this will let you change from rectangular coordinates x and y into polar oh that's a radius that's our r that's what the r meant also because tangent of theta is y over x well theta would be tangent inverse of y over x this is what lets you change from rectangular into finding an angle and that's exactly what polar does polar gives you an r and a theta a radius and an angle to tell you exactly where this point is in a slightly different way a very different way than x and y then a rectangular coordinate system these two are how we change from rectangular to polar but there is one thing that you got to watch out for enter angle you see when we do this when we find this angle from tan inverse we have to remember what tan inverse does tangent inverse only works from negative pi over two to pi over two so a couple things can happen here firstly because tangent inverse only works from negative pi over two to pi over two if you have an angle in quadrants four or one if your point is in four or one you are set tangent inverse will work perfectly don't change the thing so if your point if your rectangular point rectangular represented point is in quadrants four or one just do tangent inverse and you are basically done one caveat to that however if your point is in quadrants two or three tangent inverse will not give you that angle it will only give you angles from four to one that's what tangent tangent inverse does it's only defined for negative pi over two to pi over two so it can't even give you angles in quadrants two or three from pi over two to three pi over two so here's what to do if you have a point in quadrants two or three and your your angle is only going to be given in quadrants four one just add pi so we're going to be plotting our points we'll determine our quadrants just like we did in the last video but we're going to understand that if our point is in quadrants 2 or 3 our angle that's given to us from quadrant 401 we just have to add pi to get there it's going to work out just fine i also said there's one more caveat if you have a point in quadrant four your tangent inverse will give you at a negative angle that's how it works from negative pi over two to pi over two is going to give you a negative angle if you don't want the negative angle if you have to have a positive just add 2 pi it'll bring it right back to quadrant 4 but it'll be a positive angle so with that that that's basically everything we're going to be doing that's a whole entire lesson we just need to practice right now so i'm going to walk you through exactly how to do these these examples change between rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates for a point there's really not a lot to it beside this we said understanding exactly what angle is being given to you based on our definition of tangent inverse so as we go through i'll be explaining everything again that i've just done but because this was not really super concrete because we have an example it'll make more sense as we go so let's get right to it the first thing we're going to do is identify what sort of a representation we have do we have rectangular or do we have polar sometimes it's very difficult to tell especially something like 3 0 that could easily represent polar coordinates with an r of 3 and an angle of 0. now it doesn't i wrote rectangular just so we would know that but understand that sometimes it's very difficult if you're not told what you're dealing with so in in this in this video we're talking about going from rectangular into polar what that means is that if we're given a rectangular coordinate representation of a point the first thing we want to do is identify the x and the r and then plot it identify where the quadrant is so x and r x is always first and y is always second for rectangular coordinates of a point and so i'm going to write this out explicitly very very similar to what we did in the last video for r theta we said hey r theta means you have a radius of one you have an angle that puts you in some position along the polar axis or from the polar axis then you go out from that that origin or the pole and that gives you a specific point well we always identified what the r was and what the theta was before we did any work on it we're going to do the same thing here our x is 3 and our y is 0. after we do that after we identify what x and y are we plot our point so x being 3 and y equals 0 because we have this rectangular coordinate system just really handy for us we're going to plot the point at 3 0. now that's right on the x-axis that's that would be like a quadrant angle really if we're talking polar coordinates or not yet but if we were that'd be a quadrant angle that's right in the x-axis so we're gonna do two things number one thing we're going to do the first thing we do we're going to find r there's really never any ambiguity with r r says just take the square root of x squared plus y squared because that is the pythagorean theorem if we do x squared plus y squared is r squared just take a square root of both sides you get r equals x squared plus y squared now you probably notice that i'm missing something i'm missing the negative and that's on purpose really we want to try to keep our r positive otherwise we'll switch back and forth between quadrants that we don't want to be in so we're going to take the positive r all the time our angle will determine our quadrant force accurately as long as we follow this so do your x and y write down that's fine plot your point identify where it is this is somewhere between quadrant 4 and quadrant 1. because tangent inverse is defined between quadrant 4 and quadrant 1 it will give us this angle perfectly that's what tan tan inverse does it works perfect from here to here that's great news so we've done our point we've labeled x and y we've plotted it we're going to find r first and we have in the back of our mind the tangent inverse is going to work fine so finding r r is just a matter of taking the square root of x squared plus y squared because x is three and y is zero that's three squared plus zero squared in our case that's just 9 the square root of 9 is 3 rr is 3. now that we have our r we move on to finding our theta our angle because tangent theta equals y over x that means that tangent inverse of y over x is going to be theta we already have the y and x the y and x are your coordinates all we've got to do is put them in a fraction in the right order and take tangent inverse and so we're going to do that so tangent inverse of zero over three there there's two things that are really important to think about number one what what the inverse really is and number two where it is so we're thinking tangent inverse of zero over three that's tangent inverse of zero tangent inverse of zero is zero so what this says is what angle gives you a y to x relationship of zero for tangent sometimes having that table is really really handy right here so tan inverse of zero is zero this is an angle of zero the second important thing to think about is where this is so what it is we got it we know it's zero but where it is is this angle well it's going to be somewhere between negative pi over two and pi over 2 but is it representing what we want it to is it representing something in the right quadrant or at least between the same quadrants and it is because our point is between quadrants 4 and 1 this angle represents this perfectly this is an angle of 0 along the polar axis now what if you had negative 3 0 negative 3 0 would be over here this angle wouldn't cut it in that case you'd add pi so for anything outside of quadrants four or one just take what your tangent inverse gives you and add pi to it it will work every time so that's kind of nice it's a little helpful hint hopefully you wrote that down um furthermore i want to talk just a little bit about the reason why this happens why tangent only gives you that you see the the problem is this y over x when we compare y over x a fraction doesn't know or a ratio doesn't know the difference between a negative y and a positive x and a positive y and a negative x it both works out to negative for the ratio it also doesn't understand the difference between positive y positive x and negative y negative x that's exactly why tangent inverse can't give you out both something in quadrants one and three positive y positive x and negative y and negative x when you put them in a fraction work out the same they're both positive that's why tangent's positive here and here and why tangent inverse cannot give you out both it will only give you out things in quadrant one the same thing happens with positive x negative y or positive y and negative x it gives you a negative for the fraction tangent inverse can't give you out both so it only gives you out quadrant four and we have to understand that if our angle if our point is somewhere between here and here we have to have add theta we have to add pi to whatever angle we're given so now that we have this we know that our r is three our theta is zero it's in the right quadrant or at least between the same two quadrants this right here would be an angle of zero and an r of three it's the same exact point it just has a different representation and so we can write it a little bit differently actually write it the same but it means something different we're still going to write 3 0. the way we write polar coordinates is r comma theta so 3 0 and that would be the polar representation of the polar coordinates for that point i hope it makes sense i hope you're seeing that it's really not a hard process you really are just using two things two formulas really r is pythagorean theorem and to find our our theta we're using a tan inverse we just have to be careful here if your point is in quadrants two or three add pi to whatever angle this gives you if your your point is in quadrant four and you need a positive angle add two pi not pi even though the period of tangent is pi we don't want to be outside of the correct quadrant so you have to add 2 pi to get back in the right quadrant but make it positive okay we're going to move on a little bit but we're going to go a little bit quicker since we've explained everything about it we're just changing between rectangular coordinates and polar x comma y and r comma theta so whenever we're given a rectangular coordinate representation of a point the first thing we want to do is identify the x and the y so in our case x equals two and and sorry x equals zero and y equals two next thing plot it see where it is because x is zero and y equals two that puts us on the y axis the positive y axis right there at zero comma two what what we would expect from there we can always find r very nicely and pretty easily there's never an ambiguity with r all you've got to do is take the square root of x squared plus y squared keep the positive r because the angle will determine the correct quadrant for you so r for the distance r for the radius and angle for the where it is at in our case because 0 squared is 0 and 2 squared is 4 the square root of 4 is 2. i keep the positive r this is how far away from the origin or the pole we really are that's great now we got to locate where this is to get the right orientation on the polar axis so our first never ambiguity just tells you how far you away from the origin and then our theta tells you where you are at in relation to your really x axis but we call a polar axis for polar coordinates so now we're going to find theta and you go wait a minute leonard you're giving me tangent inverse of 2 over 0 2 0 is undefined yes it is now think about where tangent is undefined what angle would give you tangent of an undefined relationship think about it it would be pi over 2 or negative pi over 2 or 3 pi over 2. now which one is appropriate this is why i'm giving this example so i can illustrate this concept right here you have to think about where your point is before you pick the appropriate theta before you pick the appropriate angle so we have a couple choices tangent is undefined at pi over 2 and negative pi over 2 or pi over 2 and 3 pi over 2. now which one of those actually fits this well let's see 3 pi over 2 would be all the way right here that's not where my point is pi over 2 would be right here that's where my point is negative pi over 2 would be down here that's not where my point is so the only appropriate choice to to have the same point with different coordinates is to pick an angle of pi over 2. remember our angle locates where our point is so pi over 2 says oh yes pi over 2 would be right here oh that's where my point is so we plot our point so it helps us to determine that if we hadn't applauded that we very well might have looked at this and i don't know which but to pick negative pi over 2 pi over 2 because when we're asked for this it says tangent of tangent inverse of 2 over 0 that's tangent inverse of an undefined thing tangent is undefined when our angle is what basically says what angle gives you tangent being undefined that would be pi over 2 negative pi over 2 3 pi over 2 any multiple of pi over 2 that would be a problem we have to find the right one that represents where that point is perfectly the only one that does is not negative pi over 2 not 3 pi over 2 but pi over 2. it still gives us something undefined that's still represented as well but it's locating where that point is exactly now that we have that all we've got to do is put it in a point in a polar coordinate point so that would be r comma theta that's r or two comma pi over two and that's exactly what where this point is in polar coordinates if i went pi over 2 that's saying this is where i'm at go from the pole up to or along this this angle 2 and you're going to be exactly right there it's representing the same point in a slightly different look okay next one we have a point in rectangular coordinates that's one comma negative one the first thing we're going to do to convert to polar is make sure we understand what the x is what the y is i always write it down to make sure that i don't actually change things especially when finding my angle hopefully you understand why that's so important uh if i plot this incorrectly or find my angle incorrectly have that thought down i'm going to get a completely wrong quadrant i don't want to do that so i'm going to label this as x y make sure my x is 1 my y is negative 1. so once i've done that i want to make sure that i plot this point before i do anything else even find r even though it's a little bit easy uh what i want to do is make sure that we plot this to locate where it is so because x is one and y is negative one that's going to put in put a squarely in quadrant number four so our point is one negative one i'm going to think hey this is in quadrant four but i do have it written down so i can always look back at my graph and say hey i plotted this point quadrant four fantastic that's that's why we do that so we can immediately locate where this thing is we know things about quadrant four we know that tangent inverse gives us our angles in quadrant 4 and 1. this is good news that means that i'm not going to have to add pi to this because tangent inverse works well in the quadrant where my point is that's important so i have that in the back of my mind so i've looked at said x and y are these i plotted i know where it is now we're going to find r there's never an ambiguity with r it's kind of the easy one we're going to take positive r saying how far we are away from the pole or the origin the angle is where we are and that's it's a little bit more difficult because of tangent we saw that here tangent inverse make things a little bit trickier because you have to think about exactly what angle to take in some situations like we already saw so find r though not too bad so in our case r is square root of 2. leave it as a square root that's just fine you don't need to put 1.41 or anything unless you absolutely have to approximate it leave it exact we really don't want to lose exactness here we're trying to represent exactly where this point is in a different type of coordinate system so this is exactly where this point is in terms of x and y we're finding exactly where this point is and we already have this in terms of r now we just need to find theta how do we find theta well we do tan inverse of y over x and we really want to make sure we get that as y over x that's why we label it so okay why is this x is this now we think about that so tangent inverse of negative one what in the world is tangent inverse negative one tangent inverse only gives you out net angles from negative pi over two to pi over two so tangent inverse of negative one says what angle will give me a y over x of negative one that's going to be negative pi over four that's how tangent inverse works remember it gives you from negative pi over two to pi over two so yes it works in quadrants four and one but it will only give you out negative angles for quadrant four that's going to lead us to a note here in just a second so our theta is negative pi over 4. now you're done tangent inverse works great for points in quadrants four and one since our point is in four and one tangent inverse gives us our angles in those two quadrants that's perfect we could easily write this as r comma theta or square root two comma negative pi over 4. now i did say there was one caveat for points in quadrant four we're going to write a note here if you have to have a positive angle so it says give me your polar coordinates but i want you to make sure that you're from 0 to 2 pi this is not in it this is below zero and so that would be a problem if you have to have positive angles and you have a point in quadrant four tangent inverse will only give you negative angles for that it will not give you a positive add two pi do not add pi why why not even though the period for tangent is pi adding pi would put you in quadrant two hey that's the way we're going to get angles for quadrant two find this one add pi that's perfect just like if we have a point here we're going to find quadrant one angles and add pi but if i add pi to something here it's going to give me something in quadrant 2. i don't want that i want to add 2 pi to get back to exactly where i'm at oh man i hope you remember that if we add 2 pi we get right back to where our point is we've just gone one full revolution around our unit circle that's basically the same idea if i had 2 pi i'm going to get right back to where this point is but i will have a positive angle instead of a negative angle something between 0 and 2 5 so write a little note here if your point is in quadrant 4 and you need positive angles add 2 pi for points in quadrant 4 add 2 pi not pi even to the period tangent is pi add 2 pi to get the same quadrant with a positive angle so for us that means if we add 2 pi to negative pi over 4 let's see negative pi over 4 plus 8 pi over 4 that would be 2 pi would be 7 pi over 4. we could write this equivalently as square root of 2 comma 7 pi over 4. and that would give us an r and a theta same exact point whether we do this or this or this but it does depend on on how we want to see it on what we're working with is it the same does it does it do the same thing yeah if we do negative pi over 4 that's that angle that's negative pi over four and an r of square root two hey look at that if you have a one and a one on a on a triangle like an isosceles right triangle your your your radius there your pi your your hypotenuse is the square root of two that's exactly why we got the square root of two it's pythagorean theorem this angle is negative pi over four or seven pi over four but either way you're going to get exactly the same point with a different type of coordinate system i hope it's making sense i hope you're seeing why we're using these two things to get from rectangular and polar because it relates x and y to r because it relates x and y to theta i hope you're seeing the the issue that we have with tangent inverse that because it only gives you angles in quadrants four or one negative pi over 2 to pi over 2 there's a little bit more work to do that's why i said it's a little bit harder in the last video and it is you do have to think about it you don't have to think about arc keep the positive r the angle is going to tell you where you are so r how far away you are angle where you are locates where you are so we're going to talk about what happens when we don't have an angle in quadrants four or one we already talked about some quadrant angles here which is kind of nice but we'll go ahead and deal with angles that end up in quadrants two or three next let's keep right on going so we've got a couple more points represented as rectangular coordinates we want to translate them into polar we're going to consider negative three comma three if that's rectangular which i've said it is then x is negative 3 and y is positive 3. we're going to write that down first after that we're going to plot it and we're going to start thinking about where that's at negative 3 comma 3 puts us into quadrant 2. right about there now another thing these don't have to be perfect you just really have to get the right quadrant so whether or not this is to scale or anything especially on stuff like negative 2 square root 3 who cares it doesn't really matter what matters is a representation telling you where the quadrant is why because in the back of my head right now i'm thinking r is going to be nice to find it's never going to be ambiguous for us but when i go to find my angle tangent inverse can only give me out angles in quadrants 4 and 1. negative pi over 2 to pi over 2. in fact in quadrant 4 it only gives negative angles so i have to do something with those angles if i need a positive but for angles in quadrant 2 and 3 i'm certainly going to have to add pi to whatever angle i find here so i have that in the back of my head so i've got x y i've plotted it i know my quadrant i'm in quadrant two i'm thinking about angle ahead of time now i'm going to find my r and it looks like our r is three square root two so negative three squared is nine three squared is nine not the sine is eighteen um the square root of eighteen we can simplify by by taking that and factoring that as nine times two the square root of nine is three square root of two is i don't know square root 2 but we do have the first half of our polar coordinates we have 3 square root 2. now it's time to find theta theta is still found by using tangent inverse and relating y over x that's fine but what we do is we realize that because the angle it's given us is not in the right quadrant we have to do something to it and you can probably see it here tangent has no way of telling whether you mean negative 3 over positive 3 or positive 3 over negative 3 because of the way that negatives work in fractions we explained a little while ago but there's no way for to know which is why we had to choose when we defined tangent inverse to only pick quadrants 4 and 1 because of the one-to-one function inverses have to be otherwise we'd have two options every time and tangent will let you do that so because tan inverse only gives you out angles in quadrants four and one this right here this tan inverse of negative one is going to give you negative pi over four again now really appreciate this please don't just treat this as a formula please don't treat it like oh if it's in quadrant two i just add pi you can but really think about why that is tangent inverse gave you this angle of negative pi over four from your polar axis that's going to be here it would say here's where your point is but that's not right my point is in quadrant two how do i get to quadrant two add pi that's why this works is because this is always going to be off one pi away from your actual quadrant if you are in if your points are in quadrants two or three it's going to give you something that's pi radians away so this says all right negative pi over 4 that's the wrong quadrant i'm going to add pi it'll put me into quadrant two so let's see negative pi over four plus four pi over four that's three pi over four can you see how a lot of people who really don't understand what tangent universe does they would give that and then they'd be really confused like why doesn't that work i'm doing tangent inverse it's what the notes say it does say that but because of the way tangential inference works we have to really think about what it's giving you and if we're outside of what it's giving you you just add pi to it because it'll put you in the correct quadrant because it can't give you out everything only gives you a half the unit circle so that's why this that's a no go you do not want that and sure enough when we do plot the polar coordinates with an r of 3 square root 2 and a theta of 3 pi over 4 r tells you how far away from the origin or the pole you are if you super superimpose a polar coordinate system on this that would act as your origin of the pole the theta tells you where you are so three pi over four says from your polar axis basically the x-axis you're 1 2 3 pi over 4 and your whatever that r is away that's exactly the same point in exactly the same location we didn't approximate anything about this that's perfect that's what we're looking for it matches the right quadrant that's really what we're checking here if our math is right which it is then we just represent that point two different ways in two different coordinate systems let's move on to the next one so we got another rectangular representation of a point we got negative 2 comma negative 2 square root 3. first thing we're going to do identify x identify y second thing plotted so we can identify the quadrant so negative two x is negative two comma negative two square root of three y is negative two square root of three that's going to put us into quadrant number three now you notice that i i don't really know exactly where that is negative 2 square root of 3. i don't really care as long as my quadrant is correct it's going to be just fine for us our angle might be a little funny for our for our polar coordinates but that doesn't really matter as long as our quadrant is right so i've represented this as negative two negative two square root of three it's in quadrant number three so in my head what am i thinking i'm thinking r is going to be fine we're gonna take the positive r like we do all the time just tells us how far away we are the angle is going to tell us where we are but because i'm in quadrant 3 i know that what i get from tangent inverse is not going to be the angle i need it's going to be pi radians away i'm going to be adding pi to this because this angle is going to give us something out in or this this point this tan inverse for this point is going to give us something out in quadrant 1. i'm going to have to add pi to it to get quadrant 3. so with our r we're going to take negative 2 squared plus negative 2 square root 3 squared all instead of the square root that's going to give us 4. this is going to give us 4 times 3 which is 12. so 4 plus 4 times 3 that's going to be 16 the square root of 16. so we know for sure that for our polar coordinates for this point r is four we're going to be four units away from the origin or four units away from the pole that's great news now we're going to focus on our theta so theta equals tan inverse of y over x what happens when you take negative 2 and divide by negative 2 what do you get get positive you get positive 1 times square root 3. this is why this is the last time i'll say it really this is why tangent inverse can't give you both it can't tell the difference between negative negative and positive positive and so it chooses to take the positive positive quadrant one rather than quadrant three so that we had a one-to-one function for tangent so that it would actually become an inverse how we wanted it to and so this right here is going to give you out an angle in quadrant one so this says all right um what angle gives you a y over x relationship or ratio of square root 3 over 1. i'd use my table it would be just fine what we're going to get out of that let's see sine has to be bigger than cosine so it's going to be square root 3 over 2 over one-half that's got to be pi over 3. so i know that theta here is pi over 3. let's put pi over three there for a second is that going to work well we try here's pi over three that doesn't look like where my point is at all if i go pi over 3 and up 4 along that angle that would be incorrect because that is not at all the right quadrant that i want to be in now some of you are thinking well wait a minute what if i did pi over 3 and did a negative 4 negative r that actually would work but because we prefer positive r we really like to keep r positive and angle where it actually is in the correct quadrant that's a little bit less confusing to see but it is possible to do this with a pi over 3 and a negative r reversing your quadrant that's a little bit of tricky math uh but you could do it so i don't want the i don't want the pi over three what i want is the the angle that puts me in the right quadrant with the positive r that i've already chosen so in order to do that if my pi 3 says i'm here i'm going to add pi to get into the correct quadrant so pi over three plus three pi over three that's the same thing as pi that's four pi over three and what we'd end up with is 4 comma 4 pi over 3 in terms of polar coordinates let's see if that works 4 pi over 3 would be let's see 1 2 3 4 pi over 3 and out 4 units from the origin or the pole that's going to put us in exactly the same position as our rectangular representation of that point it is the same as long as we i identify the quadrant our points in and let tangent inverse give us out the right angle for four and one add pi if you're in two or three you're going to be all set if you need positive angles and you have a point in quadrant four you have to add two pi so i'm going to come back with some awkward ones things that aren't on your unit circle we'll talk about how to deal with that okay so these look a little funny because those are decimals and we haven't really dealt with that before we dealt with some square roots which worked out very nicely things i need a circle and these are not so i wanted to give you two examples on how to deal with that thankfully the techniques that i give you typically work all of the time always work all the time because i don't like teaching two different things so this is why that i gave you draw the picture and plot your point because it will determine where whether or not to add pi or not or add 2 pi if you have quadrant 4 and you need a positive angle so that's that's why i gave that to you and so we're going to follow the same exact steps the only difference is that you're not going to be able to find an exact representation of your angle on a unit circle you'll have to use your calculator and we'll approximate that and that'll be just fine so the first thing hey we got a rectangular coordinate representation of a point let's write down x let's write down y let's plot where that is so positive 1.3 for x negative 2.1 for y puts us into quadrant 4. let's say right about there all that really matters is that we are in quadrant four that's how we're going to find our theta in just a moment so now that we've plotted that we know we're in quadrant four i'm thinking in my head this is going to give me out a negative angle i hope you see that tangent inverse is going to give me out a negative angle for quadrant four if i need a positive i'm going to have to add 2 pi i'm not going to add pi i want to stay in quadrant 4 but i would add 2 pi tangent inverse gives you out things in 4 and 1 but negatives in 4. let's find r first so with r we're going to take a square root of x squared plus y squared and you get square root of 6.1 this is exactly what r is i didn't round that at all so if you wanted an exact approximation for or exact representation of r it would be square root of 6.1 if you're okay with the approximation this is about 2.47 so you could use square root of 6.1 there or if you're approximating 2.47 that's the distance away from the origin of this point is all we need to know to know is location of as far as an angle so what angle it creates with our x-axis or polar axis in order to find that we're going to use tan inverse now that's not super nice because we can't really simplify it and it's not on our unit circle and so we're going to have to use our calculator and so what we do we just press tan inverse make sure that you are in radians please make sure you're in radians if you're going to represent this in radians or degrees if you're representing degrees most of the time we pick radians and we add pi as 3.14 or 2 pi is 2 times 3.14 to make sure we're in the right location for our quadrants so i'm going to make sure that my calculator is in radians that's about negative 1.02 radians what in the world does that mean remember what pi is pi is approximately 3.14 radians so to get from here to here would be 3.14 radians one radian is really what one rating was the angle it took to create a radius equal to the arc length where it's one and one that's really what it was and so our our run radiance about right there takes about 3.14 to get to pi exactly about 3.14 to get to pi so negative 1.02 radians is well where would it be it wouldn't be past quadrant 4 yet it'd be somewhere between here and here why because pi over 2 3.14 divided by 2 is more than 1.02 so negative pi over 2 is more negative than negative 1.02 that angle is somewhere in here that's great that's what we wanted that is in quadrant four so if that's acceptable if you have negative angles you write that down and you're done what if that's not okay well if we found anything out it's that tangent inverse only gives you out negative angles for quadrant four and only angles from four to one so if you need to keep your angle in quadrant four but you need it positive you have to add two pi well now what is 2 pi 2 pi is 2 pi radians that would be 2 times about 3.14 or 6.28 so if we add 2 pi to this we get approximately 5.26 radians what in the world does that mean that that means this you can locate this same exact point with an r of around 2.47 or exactly square root of 6.1 and either negative 1.02 radians or positive 5.26 radians think about this 5.26 radians is less than 2 pi radians it's just 1.02 radians less than that it's going to give you the same exact location at point so whether we go negative one point zero two or positive five point two six we still do end up in quadrant four that's exactly what our point told us we needed to do that's exactly where a point is just a different representation i hope that one makes sense that that gets a little wild if you don't have a picture of that you know i i don't what's negative 1.02 even mean um that that's what it means i hope i've explained it well enough for you to understand it let's go into the next one so we have one last rectangular representation of a point our x is negative point eight our y is negative two point one we're gonna write that first then we're going to locate it so negative negative says we're in quadrant three some are about right there so negative point eight negative two point one at least we know we're in quadrant three now that says something about our our theta when we get tangent inverse it's going to give us something in quadrant one we're going to have to add pi to it let's find our r first but we have it in the back of our head and if we do all the work on that if we take x squared plus y squared take a square root we'll have square root of exactly 5.05 so that is an exact answer if you need an exactness you would use this one an approximation is i took a square root i got about 2.25 so r r right now our distance from the origin is approximately 2.25 units or exactly square root of 5.05 and then we work on theta because theta's given by tan inverse all we're going to do is take our y over x but that's not our unit circle negative or negative gives us a positive it's going to be in quadrant one can inverse when using our calculator is going to give us about 1.21 about 1.21 radians now is that okay is that where we want to be because 1.21 well that's not really even to pi over 2 yet so we are about right there that's where 1.21 radians is if we go to 1.21 radians and we go out 2.25 we are the right distance away from our pole but in the wrong location we're in the wrong quadrant tangent inverse cannot give you anything in these two quadrants i've made that very clear so what do you do to get to this quadrant you have to add pi to it because pi is approximately 3.14 we can do that at approximately 3.14 will typically work most calculators have a pi button on there so we're going to add pi for anything that's in quadrants two or three add pi to the angle that you get you will be fine you can even most of the time subtract pi but you'll get negative angles so you can add pi to anything in these two anything in these two quadrants add pi to the angle you get you'll be perfect anything in quadrant four add two pi 2 if you need a positive angle so i'm going to add pi because i was in quadrant 3. the angle says i'm in quadrant 1. i'll take care of that and so if we do if we do add pi and rounded appropriately we're going to get 4.35 radians let's see if that makes sense 3.14 radians puts us about at pi pi is a little bit more than that but 3.14 radians would be here 4.35 would be past that hey we're in the right quadrant it's not yet to three pi over two that's not enough so we are all the way to here and out 2.25 that's exactly the same location that point with a different representation i really hope i've made it clear on how this works the r is pretty straightforward we do generally keep the positive i gave you one instance where you could take the negative and still get the same location but it is more difficult to see for that reason we almost always take the positive r here we let the r determine the distance from our origin or pole we let the theta determine our location four quadrants four and one you have the right angle from your tan inverse for quadrant four add two pi if you need positive for quadrants for points in quadrants two and three just add pi to the angle that you get that's about all there is to it next time we're going to talk about is how to convert equations from rectangular to polar and then a different video on polar to rectangular hope you're doing well you
