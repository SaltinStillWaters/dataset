Transcript for: Introduction to Angles (Precalculus - Trigonometry 1)
hey there welcome to another video in this video we get to start trigonometry which is awesome i actually love trigonometry i love it because it's kind of fun sort of in a really weird way but super useful if you have a good grasp on trigonometry calculus becomes much much easier because usually when students get wrapped up in the hard parts of calculus it's either algebra which i've taught you very well or trigonometry but you're going to learn very well so being that we're going to start trigonometry and it has almost everything to do with angles we're going to look at angles first so the outline of where we're going is we're going to study angles we'll talk about degrees we'll talk about radians how to convert between them some real life examples and then we'll start getting into what's called the unit circle which you're going to use like the rest of your math lives to kind of memorize it so we're going to start with what an angle is where they come from and have a very good grasp about what degrees and radians are without that foundation it's very hard to understand why you need both how to convert between them and really what they mean without understanding the foundation of them so let's start with what angles are really anytime you take two rays and they have a common starting spot like an origin or we call that a vertex you're going to get some sort of an angle between them remember a ray is a line with a starting point pretty much it's not both directions it goes in one direction looks kind of like a vector well if you give those uh the same starting spot even if the the angle is zero zero degrees zero radians even if it's zero there's still something between them like we could say well they say the same uh same direction there there's no distance between them but we can call that angle zero so anytime you have that you have some sort of an angle exactly what we say here so a couple things when we get started when we put an angle on what's called standard position that's on the x y axis with the origin representing that vertex of an angle and the initial side on or x-axis and a terminal side measured counterclockwise positively so i'm going to show that to you right now so anytime you see an angle in standard position which is pretty universal here this right here this x-axis side is called your initial side and where that angle stops the angle is this swept out portion so where that angle stops is called your terminal side this distance between them or this swept out portion that we see between the initial side and your terminal side is called your angle please make a note here that all of your angles are measured positively counterclockwise so counter-clockwise or or anti-clockwise is when we go in reverse direction of how a normal standard face clock goes so like this that's called counterclockwise another side note here is if we happen to measure angles clockwise they're measured negatively from where that initial side is so typically your positive x-axis so your initial side always positive x-axis we measure positively if counterclockwise negatively if clockwise and we can do a lot of different things with that so this angle that's swept out is this part right here and we show that which show that we're going counterclockwise from the initial side to the terminal side and that's our angle a lot of times you're going to see an angle represented by this greek letter theta it's very standard we can call them different things i'm going to use alpha in a second we call them lots of different letters but this is very standard as we see a lot in trigonometric notation like the sine cosine tangent which we're going to get to you've probably heard of that an angle is represented a lot of times by alpha beta and theta we do fees and everything other things also but that's pretty common so a little bit of recap hey look if you have two rays and they start at the same spot you're going to have an angle between them even if it's zero a measurement of zero radians or degrees and so two ways to measure angles when we sweep out that distance from an initial side starting on the x-axis to its terminal side where this angle ends or where the other ray is we call that positive measurement if counterclockwise and negative clockwise and we show it with the direction that we've measured and we show it with an angle name like theta so what we're going to do now is explore a little bit and get this this idea of what a degree means we'll see that a lot more a little bit and then talk about what are called quadrant angles so let's look down here what if we have an initial side our initial side in standard position should always be on the x-axis and just like it is right here so if this is our initial side and we start measuring positively so remember positively is counterclockwise and we measure we go around and around and around and round and round and round and round and round around and we come back to where we started if our terminal side is where our initial side is and we've made one let's call it the full rotation we've swept out an entire rotation on that x y plane from our standard position that is called a 360 degree angle so this angle that we'd show notice how we did we did the same thing here we said here's our initial side here's our terminal side and we showed the direction of measurement which has to be positive because we measured counterclockwise and we showed where our terminal side is also we named this an angle this right here being that this is one full rotation we call that 360 degrees for an angle measurement so if one full rotation of that that let's say terminal side compared to our initial side sweeps out of that full thing there that's 360 degrees so we can also think of this as one degree equals one 360th of a rotation let's talk about a few other ones so let's say that we have our initial side on our x-axis like is very standard and we make that angle so our two rays are on the x-axis positive and the positive y-axis and we're going to measure counter-clockwise you should know that's positive at this point that's our angle so we've measured that positively we've shown that that's sweeping out of that portion of our xy plane we've called that theta well if if one let's see if one full rotation is 360 degrees and we have these things called quadrants so there's one two three four we name them as we rotate positively so it'll be a counterclockwise naming of quadrants one two three and four then if we sweep out the first quadrant and all of them are equal let's say sizes if you will or have an equal angle between them then this would be 1 4 of a rotation 360 degrees divided by 4 or 1 4 times that would be 90 degrees and that's why we get that 90 degree angle between the positive x and the positive y by the way just a little side note do you have to put that little degree thing you really do it's important because if we don't have that we can lose part of what we're talking about and we're also going to have a different type of measurement called radiance and it's really important to put what type of an angle you're talking about most people do not understand what a radiant is they just go it's radiance you know what that means we're going to talk a lot about that because it's really crucial and it's very important and a lot of your formulas that we're going to be using only work with radian measured angles not degrees or you have to convert between them now what if we keep on going what if we have our initial side on the x-axis and we have our terminal side on the negative x-axis and so when we show this positively measured angle going counter-clockwise we go all the way to here well if that's half of a full rotation and a rotatable rotation is 360 degrees that will be 360 divided by two that's 180 degrees this is where that that idea of because we know an x-axis is a straight number line this is where the idea of a straight line contains 180 degrees that's where that really comes from what if we kept on going we said all right uh you know what let's go ahead and let's have our initial side here let's measure counterclockwise so positively but let's end on the negative y-axis so we always show the direction that this angle has rotated or swept out would maybe be a more appropriate term we show the initial side we know that show this terminal side we show that this is the angle that we're talking about and now let's think about it this is three quadrants or three-fourths of a full rotation so 360 times three-fourths was going to be 270 degrees what we've got here are what what are called quadrant angles so if your initial side and your terminal side happen to be on any of your axes we get what's called a quadrant angle and that's the angle that sweeps out a full quadrant or two full quadrants or three four quadrants or full four four quadrants and that's the 90 180 270 and 360 that you're probably familiar with what about the other one what if what if here i didn't actually sweep out anything i had an initial side and a terminal side that didn't sweep out well our angle would be zero in that case so if we don't sweep out any distance let's say or any any angle really then we would have this this angle of zero so a lot of times on the x-axis you're going to see this represented in standard position as this is zero or 360 degrees that's what that quadrant angle could be it could be another full rotation we get that 720 and we can do a lot of things like that so that's why that's there because if you didn't have this if i just imagine that that rotation is gone that that angle that terminal side didn't sweep out a full rotation of this x-ray plane then that would have an angle of zero i hope that's making sense to you i hope you understand that really we're talking about something very simple with a lot of great things that come from it these angles so we're talking about two rays that just start at the same spot well depending on how much they sweep out we get a larger or smaller angle we always measure those angles counterclockwise for positive and clockwise for negative we're going to do that in just a second where where our terminal side terminates we can say if that's on an axis you get a quadrant angle and those are very standard numbers that we're probably used to 90 180 270 364 zero degrees depending on what axis you're ending on if we don't terminate on one of those axes we end in what's called a quadrant so we'll talk about that really quickly right now we'll practice about six of them in just a minute but our quadrants count like i said before the same way that we measure an angle positively so on our quadrants and we would typically use roman numerals for that we have quadrant 1 two three and one less than four five so we get four and that's where our quadrants are located so notice that you there is no quadrant five there's no quadrant six if you happen to make a full rotation you end back up in quadrant one and we like that because a lot of time well later on like when you get to calculus we do some some different things without angles we can get what are called reference angles and it lets some of our identities work very nicely and so it's nice that we don't have to really think about that for some of the math that we do we just look at what quadrant we end up in and that determines the sine positive negative of our trig functions a lot of the time for us very nicely so that's pretty much it for right now i i really need you to know that angles are not complicated things they're very simple things but they have to be measured accurately and they have to be being understood fully before we can continue so you really need to understand what standard position means you need to understand what the quadrants are we talk a lot about that we need to understand that we measure counterclockwise for positive and clockwise for negative for instance if we had to measure this negatively i'm going to do this for all three of these if we measure this negatively so clockwise rotation i call that alpha alpha would be 270 degrees but negative why negative because you measured that clockwise you said hey here's my here's my initial side here's my terminal that's a positive or counterclockwise sweeping out here's a negative or clockwise sweeping out ending at the same terminal side but going in a different direction and that creates this idea of positive and negative rotation for us being counter clockwise or clockwise respectively so we can do the same thing here if we rotated or swept out clockwise it'd still be 180 degrees but it'd be negative 180 degrees giving us the direction of that notice also how i can't call this theta anymore i have to give it a different name so i'm going to call it alpha and likewise here with an initial side on the positive x and a terminal side of the negative y we do have two choices the positive direction would be counterclockwise the negative direction of angles is clockwise i would call that negative 90 degrees i hope you're with me i hope it's making sense that's really about it if we understand that you're going to be just fine we're going to talk about six angles just seeing what quadrants they end up in which direction they're telling us to measure then we'll be done with our video all right let's practice a few angles just six of them to get our head wrapped around what they mean make sure that's really solid in your head so we're going to start talking about positive and negative angles we're going to see what quadrants they aim they end in we're going to identify the initial the terminal side the direction of rotation whether we're going to be going counterclockwise or clockwise and identifying what that angle is and showing that direction so let's start with theta equals 45 degrees now this does not end on one of our axes and so this is going to be in a quadrant and it's not a quadrant angle so how we always always start with our angles in standard position is we label our initial side first which is always that positive x-axis so i'm going to say all right we're just going to show that our initial side is on that positive x-axis because this is a positive angle it makes me go counter-clockwise to sweep out that angle and so i'm going to show that now because our first quadrant angle would be 90 degrees 45 is exactly half of that which means and it's very nice that this is going to cut through just like a y equals x line would look that array is going to start at this origin and go right through let's call the middle of that quadrant so our initial side is here on the positive x our terminal side is right in the middle of that quadrant i've done my best to show that and we're going to show that this is our angle so we always show we always show that that measurement that's been swept out and that's going to be exactly 45 degrees force if we've got it right and so we're going to show that so shown the theta we've called it theta it said that right there and shown that's 45 degrees i hope that makes sense i hope you're saying yeah we should start with the positive x it should be positive measurements go counter clockwise for us and because it's 45 degrees between 0 and 90 right in the middle of that we're doing our best to represent it now how about theta equals negative 30 degrees we're still going to start by having our initial side on our x-axis but that negative 30 makes us sweep this out clockwise so maybe that's counter-intuitive that counter-clockwise is positive but that's that's the way these things are set up for us and so we're going to sweep this out clockwise 30 degrees and wait a minute the quadrant angle here would be negative 90 so negative 30 should be exactly one third of the way through not one not one half and not a little bit not two thirds but just one third of the way through that's going to represent negative 30 degrees so i'm going to show my terminal side i'm going to do my best to show that i'm just kind of approximating here but i'm going to do my best to show where that is i'm going to show the direction of that angle being measured clockwise i'm going to show that this is 30 degrees that gives us a good visual representation of exactly what that means now thought i'm not going to answer it for you but i want you to think about it could you have got the same angle measured positively could you tell me what that is if i asked you for it so if you thought about this and said hey i'd have to go all the way around here counterclockwise that would be what would that be if i measured positively and not negatively hopefully it'd be 330 degrees that would be that full positive rotation minus that 30 degrees how about 225 so we're going to start we're going to put our initial side on a positive x-axis we're saying that's a positive angle that makes us go counter-clockwise well how far past 180 is that that's why i always do this is it's between 0 and 90 quadrant angles between 0 and 180 quadrant angles between 0 and 270 quadrant angles well this is somewhere between 180 and 270 and so we're going to say well how much if this is 180 degrees here then we are 45 degrees past that so that says 90 80 and then 45 degrees past would be somewhere in this quadrant and halfway between 180 and 225 270. so i'm showing that i'm saying i'm passing the first quadrant second quadrant halfway through the third quadrant and that's another thing we should be prepared to do we should be prepared to say this angle terminates in the first quadrant that's quadrant one this angle terminates not in a negative first quadrant kind of fun to do but but no this terminates in the one two three in the fourth quadrant so that is our fourth quadrant this terminates in our one two in our third quadrant and they're always measured that way they're measured or counted i should say the same way that we measure positive angles so one two three and four negative 135 we do have to start that on our positive x-axis for anything that's in standard position it says you do have to measure that or sweep it out clockwise because it's a negative angle so i'm thinking hey this would be negative 90 and this would be negative 180. so i'm somewhere between negative 90 and negative 180 in fact i'm 45 degrees between negative 90 and negative 180 so i'm going to show that so here's 90 here's another 45 that makes that negative because we're clockwise rotation and that makes our angle negative 135. again could you find the negative version here and the positive version here we just did i really want you to see that that whether we measure positively 225 degrees or negative 135 degrees we end up with the same terminal side so what's it what's that mean it means you can get the same picture from two different directions as should seem obvious because either way we're getting to their that ending point now does it make a difference sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't it really depends on the context of what you're dealing with sometimes it's nice to be able to change negative angles and sometimes it's nice to change the positive one thing that i do want you to do is add these up if you add it up 135 degrees and 225 degrees you're going to get 360 degrees and that that really does show you that that is the same terminal side so i hope this makes sense you hope that you're understanding and it's really sinking in this point what angles are and how we determine where to put them in relation to our quadrants in relation to our quadrant quadrant axes i'm sorry axes are quantum angles and why we can get the same terminal side positively negatively you really should try the last two on your own see if you can do them they're more than a full rotation but start with your x axis as your initial side go positively for positively or counterclockwise 4 405 go negatively or clockwise or negative 540 and see where you end up of course we're going to do that now so 405 degrees man that's that's more than one full rotation so how we showed that we'd say all right if we have a positive 405 degree angle we still have our initial side but we've gone all the way around and then we're going to keep on going it looks kind of like a spiral so you can do this for really really large angles just going to be a spiraling out that would be 360 degrees so remember that this angle right here is 0 degrees or 360 degrees that would be 90 that'd be 280 and this is 270 and those are our quadrant angles so if i'm going 405 degrees let's see that would be 45 degrees more than 360 and that's really how i think about it i try to figure out what quadrant angle am i just past so i've gone past 90 pascal 80 past 270 past 360 but not not past 360 plus 90. i'm somewhere between that 360 and that whatever that would be plus 90. now we've got 450 and so this is between there well where where where between there well if this is 360 and this would have to be 450 think about that 360 plus 90. then i'm 45 degrees between that so 405 let's just do minus 360. that's what we've done we said this counts as 360 degrees 405 minus 360 is 45. so this says i am 45 degrees yeah i don't really like that it looks like it's right in the middle but 45 degrees past that full rotation so i'm going to show that that shows that i've kind of spun or rotated one time around that that entire plane and then a little bit further now could you do the same thing negatively sure could you the same terminal angle with just a 45 degree angle yes sometimes it matters how many times you've rotated and sometimes it doesn't if we're dealing with sine and cosine and things like that we usually uh take the domain and restrict it so they're easier to work with in a lot of cases and when we get there that's going to make a little bit more sense when i'm prefacing where we're going with it so you understand that sometimes we need those rotations to be there and sometimes we don't all right how about the negative 540 negative 540 says you're going to start with your standard position the initial side right on the positive x it says you're going to sweep out clockwise 540 degrees so let's do that this would be negative 90 negative 180 negative 270 negative 360. so we're going to reverse those negative quadrant angles so that would be that negative 360 degrees well how much past that is that uh see let's see 540 minus 360 is 180 so i need to go 180 degrees in that clockwise rotation past where i am right now so i'm always breaking it down like that how many rotations or how many quadrant angles am i am i filling out and then where do i end between that since this is 360 and an additional 180 in that clockwise direction we end up there we can do this angle lots of different ways to get the same terminal side but none that have that same direction same rotation same number of rotations and the same terminal side so we'd show this we'd say that's negative 540 degrees and that's where the angle would be and that's what that represents so i hope this has given you a good introduction to what angles are i hope that it's very solid in your mind how they're created and what direction is positive and negative that you understand our quadrants and our quadrant angles so we have our quadrant one two three quadrant one two three even though they're measured positively and negatively respectively quadrant one this is a quadrant angle and then we have a quadrant one two three four and a quadrant one so i hope you're with me i hope it's making sense next time we're going to come back and we're going to talk about what minutes and seconds are so in terms of a degree now 360 degrees that sounds like days in a year uh 60 is a is a factor of that almost three or three sixties close to days in here um 60 is a factor that just like we have 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in kind of an hour we're gonna have 60 minutes in a degree in 60 seconds in a minute i'm going to give you how to translate back and forth so you understand what we're talking about so see you for that have a great day you
