Transcript for: Properties of Functions - Increasing vs Decreasing (Precalculus - College Algebra 9)
hey welcome to another video before we get into extrema absolute maxes men's local or relative maximum ins I wanted to talk about increase in decreasing because the way that I'm going to define local maxes and mins is the change where we change from increasing decreasing or decreasing to increasing and that give us a little peak or a little trough there and so we didn't really understand what increase in a decreasing mean in a graph in order for us to interpret that accurately so let's take a look at that for just a little bit so when we say you're going to get a formal definition in your textbook where you're going out of when we say that a function is increasing here's what we mean and then practically here's what we can look for increasing in a function or a graph means that if I take an x-value and look at one just larger than that so as you're moving from left to right of the x axis then the functions input is growing and the functions output if we're increasing is also growing so if I say hey take a look at an X value and one to the right of it then the output will be larger as we move to the right that's what increase what the says in English it says as you look from left to right so in x value and one bigger minute as you look from left to right what's your function doing if a functions increasing then the output will be getting larger as you move from left to right so in English what it says is from left to right the graph ly climbs that's what increasing means for decreasing opposite happens and this says hey look at your look at your x-values if you have an x-value that is getting larger as you move from left to right then your output will be getting smaller and that would create this graph that is falling as you move from left to right a couple notes to really keep in mind all of this is given by an open interval you will never ever use brackets or equal signs with increasing and decreasing and the reason why is because if we're increasing as a connotation that as we're moving from left to right the graph continues to climb and climb and climb and climb that mean the next value has to be bigger than the previous one and you can't stop or create this this close interval and have an increasing idea it could have increased until that point but it can be increasing because the next value would not be there and so we can't check to see well what's the next value pass an endpoint so if we have an endpoint you can't say it's well it's a you can't say it's increasing at that endpoint because there's no next value to test whether to see if the output is higher than the one that you're looking at so in order for something to to have increasing you have to have an open interval so that says you can continue to get larger and larger and larger and larger and larger to test whether to see if those outputs are getting higher and higher or smaller and smaller you can't do that if we start closing things off so all of our our intervals are always open for increasing and decreasing and they're always given by the x axis remember me telling you that how a lot of things in in graphs are determined X X it's really only arranged a couple other things with your mother y YX the idea but like domain X idea x axis idea where we're above or below the x axis x axis idea so what increase in decreasing really asks in English it is this encryption says tell me the part of the x axis where when you look from left to right your graph is climbing decreasing says tell me the part of the x axis where if you look from left to right your graph is falling that is what increasing and decreasing means as simple as I can make it so we're going to look at some intervals I'm going to use only interval notation today you can translate this to to equality notation no problem but let's take a look at this first graph we want to look for increasing first and then decreasing later you move back or it doesn't really matter but let's take a look at it when we say I'm looking for the intervals of increasing what we're looking for is the interval the part of the x-axis where when I read from left to right that's what this means left to right when I read from left to right my graph is climbing so not right to left and my grandpa's is climbing that that's not what we're talking about but as I read it from left to right my graph is climbing so it's the graph climbing on this interval no no the graph is falling as I read from left to right this graph is falling then I get to here then it climbs then I get to here and then it falls then I get to here then it climbs notice my right hand was tracing the graph but my left hand was looking at my interval on my x-axis you're the left hand here is what's determining your intervals of increasing and decreasing so again it's the section of the x-axis or as you read it from left to right my graph is climbing that's what the increasing means so I'm moving what's going all right on here to here my graph is falling oh right here right here at negative two it starts to increase until I get to zero so one interval of increasing would be on the x-axis from negative 2 to 0 this is increasing I'm just put an eye there that's an interval of increasing then at 0 it sits well at 0 at 0 am i increasing at that point am i decreasing at that point well well no this is the reason why our intervals have to be open at 0 I'm neither increasing nor am i decreasing that's called a local match we'll talk about it next time in the next video but this is where we will change from increasing to decreasing so we have this idea of open intervals for increasing decreasing because you have to happen to have the ability to get larger with every point that you're checking every next value that gets larger your function must get larger from increasing must get smaller for decreasing so we have this open interval from negative 2 to 0 where our graph was climbing as I'm looking on the x-axis from left to right there's another one so here I'm looking from here to here my graph is falling then from here to here we're increasing no problem that's climbing from 0 to 2 my graph is falling and then the next section of the graph where I look at my x axis and my graphic line is I move left to right is from 2 to 4 this is another section of increase in my graph is climbing on this portion of x axis at 3 like to write so I'm going to put all this together and we say that the increasing the the intervals of increasing are the parts of the x-axis where when I look from left to right my graph is finding that's from negative 2 to 0 that's also from 2 to 4 we must use open intervals for all of those sections of the x-axis it's a climbing idea it doesn't have climbed and then you saw here you always have to have an open interval so that you can you can satisfy this so that there's a next point and there's a next point and there's a next point open intervals that you do that get as close as you want without actually stopping and so do that we got to have open decreasing is is the opposite idea so as you're still moving from left to right but as you move up the right your graph is falling so find the intervals on the x-axis where when I look from left to right my graph is falling well my graph starts at negative 4 and it's falling until we get negative 2 so this right here would be in the interval of decreasing and another interval of decreasing so our graph decreases in this case our graph is decreasing wherever it's not increasing sometimes you can have a constant so where it's horizontal for a time and then it will neither increase nor decrease will dissipate constant we can we can deal with that too but in our case here we have an interval of decreasing section exaggerate or graphs falling as I read from left to right is negative for the negative to open interval then again from 0 to 2 that is how increasing and decreasing work they're always open they're always intervals of the x axis super important for us to understand that let's go ahead and let's talk about the the next one we'll do this one over here can you look and see man you should be doing this see if you can find the one interval of increasing so the only interval of increasing as I look from left to right on the x axis where my graph is climbing so I'm going to use to answer left hand is looking at my intervals the state studying the x-axis it's going to mark where I start and stop my right hand is tracing so here I'm falling I'm falling and falling I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling oh I hit a low point now I'm climbing a little margaret there that's gonna be where I start increasing I'm going I'm going go and go and go okay that's stop increasing put another little mark that right there is how we determine the interval of the x axis where a graph is climbing so I was fall of Spaulding's like it here I started increasing I stuck increasing that right there is my interval of increasing does not increase outside of that so interval of increasing is just from negative 1 to 1 now decreasing gets a little awkward when we think about what's going on here but and the arrows they look confusing you know oh well that's that's increasing no it's not it's not increasing because the way we're either graph has to be from left to right as our X's are getting larger so we put our hand on our x-axis or okay our graph is falling from where well falling on the x-axis this hand is way over at negative infinity negative infinity over here and positive infinity or whatever here so our graph is falling on the x axis on that interval the interval of this this graph is falling on us from negative infinity all the way until negative 1 so decreasing wise this graph is decreasing on the x axis from negative infinity to negative 1 and then again so let's see now I start to increase I stop increase oh I'm starting to decrease again so it's decreasing from 1 and then it never stops decreasing it goes down but my left hand keeps on with that x axis forever that's gonna be decreasing in to positive infinity so we'd be decreasing here and decreasing here and it doesn't end I hope that's making sense you hope the idea of your left hand is kind of your marker so where were you where you're decreasing your mark and a decrease in them when you when you change when you start increasing make a little mark so I'm decreasing a start increasing that makes my little mark here for increasing and then I stop and that's going to show you where your interval is okay this one's this one is tricky because of this right here because it looks like sometimes we get some weird graphs and we have to kind of assume where it crosses the x-axis it keeps on going forever you should be looking at this and finding your intervals of increasing right now you should be looking at that finding increasing so as far as funding increased I'm going to trace the graph of my my right hand I'm going to look at my left hand and wherever my pencil starts to climb as a move from left to right that starts my interval on the x-axis for increasing so I'm falling here I'm falling right here I start to increase so an increase increase increase increase I'm following this in my left hand I'm hitting this go up now I'm inserting decrease I'm stop that so this first interval from negative 2 to 0 that part of the x-axis is where my graph is climbing so again I'm at 0 now I'm falling falling falling falling falling falling falling falling falling Oh I've stopped falling now I'm climbing in so this next interval is an interval of increasing that starts at 2 and it doesn't end those are my two intervals on the x-axis where my graph is climbing that's exactly where showing they're always open they never include the values because of the definition that we have for increasing and decreasing now decreasing I'm going to show the intervals an x-axis where I'm falling so again I'm gonna take this No oh yeah hey I start off falling and because this goes forever it will eventually get remember X as an idea is one-dimensional it eventually get to negative infinity so this graph is falling way over here it's falling falling falling falling falling all the way to negative 2 that's interval of decreasing and then ok so now I'm increasing increasing increasing up and start to fall again so I'm going to make another interval of decreasing until we get down to this point and on the x-axis until we stop that positive 2 that's another decreasing from 0 to 2 we've seen how to work that are you seeing how hopefully you're seeing how to make your interval your graph is doing one thing but the interval is an increasing decreasing or only on the x axis so when we look one dimensional you're writing those intervals last one is that graph ever-decreasing is it ever decreasing the answer is no it's not because as we move from left to right there's nothing going on here I want to include this interval at all so I'm going there's nothing going on why would I include that there's no graph over here but right when I hit that zero oh my pencils down here so at zero open interval here it's not there's no point at zero it's not defined but it's just past zero my pencils way down here and as I trace this my craft is climbing along this portion of the x-axis it's increasing the whole entire time it'll never peak it's going to get really slow but don't let that repeat so this is increasing from let's let's see again it starts off at zero and then it climbs forever open interval there is no interval of decreasing it never falls I hope that gives you a good interpretation of what increasing decrease you mean how it is always on the x axis you you can tell how easy it is for students to go oh it's increasing from negative whatever this number is to positive whatever it's very easy to make that misconception if we really focus on this as increasing decreasing our intervals of the x axis only where your graph is climbing do it the way that I showed you and typically that works pretty well so that's gonna be where we're going to stop on this video in the next video I'm gonna talk about how where we change from increasing to decreasing in a neighborhood around that point we will have a peak and then the neighborhood around where we change from decreasing to increasing it will have a little trough and those are going to be local or relative maximum and we'll talk about that and absolute Maxima in the next video you
