Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 6.1:  The Natural Log Function
well let's get started then on your first day of calculus 2 and like I said we're going to start with Section 6.1 and we're going to talk about the natural log function you know I know you guys have seen the natural log function before but it's probably a good idea to go over some of the properties because you might have forgot them uh we haven't really worked with them a lot since maybe your like pre-calculus class maybe your math C Class when you get it for the first time so we're going to start with some of the properties what you can and what you can't do with natural logarithm and with log functions in general and how that's going to help us with our derivatives and some of our integrals so let's talk about the properties the first one first one was kind of a nice one anytime you see this you loved it because it meant if you had l n of one that was always equal to say it again Z yeah it's exactly right so what what this is if you don't remember how logarithms work logarithms say a base what's the base here d e is e is the base uh for any logarithm you don't need to write this but check this out if we had this for instance this would be our base that would be our power base to the power gives you the argument of the logarithm so this would have an exponential notation like that if you forgot all about logarithms that's like a really crash course in logarithms okay so in other words when we have a natural logorithm that's based on or the base is e the natural number e e is about 2.71 so on so on so on so when we have this this says Hey e to the 0o power gives you well how much is anything to the zero power that's why this works so anytime you see Ln of one we automatically know that's zero show up hands you feel okay with that so far good okay fantastic number two anytime you have and this is called the product property of logarithms in case you're wondering anytime you have a product within any logarithm including the natural logarithm you can always break up that logarithm into two different logarithms do you remember how to do it if I have log or Ln of x * y how do I split that up fantastic product plus plus product PP that's funny uh but anyway so product gives you a plus here so if we have Ln of x * y That's Ln of X Plus Ln of Y one thing to remember here these are not just oneway streets so we can either expand by a product or we can combine two logarithms by addition the only thing that you need to check on is that they have the same base now naturally our natural log always going to have the same same base so we're good to go as far as that goes you guys okay with number two yeah okay number three this one's really really similar and I'm imagining that even if you didn't know the property which you probably do you can probably figure it out if we expand multiplication by addition how are we going to SP expand division subtraction yeah fantastic which one's going to go first the Ln X or Ln y l that's right so Ln x minus Ln y again we can combine them we can combine two logarithms are being subtracted or we can expand a logarithm that has division inside of it we still okay so far y okay and last one this is my favorite one I love this one this one's called the power property says that anytime you have a logarithm with an exponent in the argument of that logarithm we can do something with that exponent what can we do with it yeah that's great so Ln of x to the r same thing as R * lnx now how we use these is to expand or combine logarithms and it depends on what situation we have but sometimes we'll be expanding sometimes we'll be combining depend on whether we're taking derivatives or integrals or doing something with that so let's practice just a couple times no calculus yet I want to make sure that you guys can expand some of these logarithms so let's start with that one Ln of 3x and you know what I want to make sure you guys know this the Ln goes in front of it Ln is it's not like multiplied by this argument it's Ln of the argument it's a it's a function of whatever your argument is here so Ln of 3x 4 all over 2 y^2 let's expand this as much as possible just to get the feel for how this this stuff works so um give me one idea that you might have um the minus yeah very good we we're noticing that right now we're kind of working from and you did this when you did derivatives a long time ago we're working from the outside in we don't really want to start with moving the exponents forward yet because well we got a couple of them right where would we put it doesn't really make a lot of sense so expand from the outside in the big part to the little Parts the biggest part we see the thing that combines all of this argument is division right now so let's take care of that Division and what's uh what's division changing again fantastic okay so we're going to have Ln 3x 4us Ln that's exactly right true or false right now it would be a great idea to move the exponents to the front no true or false false why because the exponent goes to X Y that's a great point so do you guys see what he was saying there he said because this exponent doesn't go to this whole thing it just it's just attributed that X I can't move forward yet now if it had been like this would I move it forward that'd be fine but if it's not you got to be real careful on that do you guys see the simple mistake that that can really really cause a problem right so watch the small stuff here all right well if we can't move that forward what's something that we can do with that logarithm what do you think how would I break them up to yeah you're exactly right because that's a product in there I can certainly do that let's do the same thing over here okay I want you think carefully on what I've just WR wrote on the board am I right or am I wrong wrong some over here why am I what did I do here negative need the go to fantastic so if we're subtracting this Ln remember if you expand this L this still means this right it still needs to be subtracted so either you're going to draw those brackets or you're going to distribute that negative that minus sign you guys with me on that one again be careful the small stuff so we're going to do a couple steps right now there's one thing I want you to do to expand this one more time what what can we do now with our logarithms Lou now you can do like the exponent to the front yeah that's absolutely right and then I'm going to distribute that minus so we'll have Ln 3 + 4 Ln xus ln2 nothing we can do there but here we'll have minus 2 Ln y this when we get to this point there's literally nothing else we can do to expand this make it any longer than than what we have right now by show of hands do you feel okay with expanding our logarithms good with it any questions at all what you're going to find out is that because we can do all this what's going to be easier to take a derivative of this argument or that argument that's way easier that's a constant forg good to sake derivative constants are hey that's fantastic this going to be a piece of cake this zero this going to be a piece of cake so we're we're getting there but by expanding logarithms we make our derivatives and our integrals a whole lot easier when we're dealing with Ln okie dokie okay tell you what we'll try um we'll try one more together and I want to see what you can do on one of them just keep something in mind too these properties they're the only properties that we have for logorithm as far as expanding combining one big thing people do in math is they like to make up their own math their own properties look if they weren't listed on the board you can't do them so be real careful about what you can expand and what you can combine so don't make up your own stuff just follow the things that they given you so let's see what we can do with this again we'll do uh one more together and one on your own so Ln x^2 + 1 all over the < TK of X tell me someone on the left hand side of the room you guys over here if I want to expand this all the way where might I start Division I would say change the X to the like theot to the 12 first I could do that sure uh I can do that now or I can do it later do you guys see what he was talking about the square root we know that's 1/2 power so we're going to do that ultimately either now or later doesn't really matter when as far as expanding goes where would I want to start would I want to start moving exponents forward would I want to start separating products or separating uh quotients which one you do the subtraction thing Okay cool so we know that this is the same thing as well since that's a quotient I know I'm going to have subtract square otk of x one more thing just a little side note for you guys whenever you're expanding sometimes you'll have to put some parentheses in the argument of your logarithm especially like right here this is really ambiguous it doesn't really say whether I have Ln of x^2 + 1 or Ln of x^2 + 1 you want to make sure you show that um don't leave the little stuff hanging out especially in calculus 2 because you get a l the the way that you write problems is important it's not meaningless like when you're doing math 80 you almost never get wrong right you just write anything you want uh but here at this level you really need to be careful about about how you're writing things so make sure you're you're accurate now I like the one2 we're going to change in just a moment what I want to know right here can I split that up anymore can I expand that any longer no that's great no we can't do it at all we know that if it was a product we could expand it but if it's plus there's nothing that says we can expand plus so if we can't expand the plus we can't move the two forward we're basically done here the only thing we can do and this was already said that is actually a power and that can move forward that's about as good we can get uh we can't split that up for sure we've already moved our power forward and that's expanded I want you to try one your I'm going give you a hard one uh if you can do this one you know what you're doing booah I think it deserves a booya let's go for it show me what you got remember that what we're doing work from the outside in go for the big Parts first and split off everything that you can follow only the properties that I've given you we can separate products we can separate quotients we can move powers to the front so do the best you can by the way when I have you do something like this I'll typically walk around the room if you have questions by all means please ask me that's is what this is for yeah to when we have a a cube root what's the power of that cube root cool so a square root because we had a square root we have 1 over two we got power over root basically the power of the inside over the root so when we have a cube root don't be putting crazy things like 2/3 or anything weird it's just 1/3 unless you have a power like this if we had a cube root of X2 that's when you would get a 2/3 power or something okay it's power over root so we have hey no problem the first thing I saw I've got division here this is containing this whole argument so I'm going to separate that division by a subtraction from the logarithm I'm also going to change that power to 1/3 power and that says I can move that out front next thing we're looking for is any remaining products or quotients in here um do you see any other products in here how many one or two good you know some some people who just don't like trigonometry they'll say oh yeah you got one right here is this a product no no this is actually the argument of a sign so this is the really the angle of that sign function so we are going to separate this product but we can't separate this it's not a product so we'll do Ln of x 5 we'll do a plus sign because we got product plus Ln of sin 2X and we'll do minus Ln of x to 4 + 2 to the 1/3 and lastly anywhere you have a exponent of an argument are we okay anytime we have an exponent of an argument we're going to move it up front so we have 5 Ln X the two can I move the two forward what do you think what does this mean when I have what does that mean X's to the 4 power is it the X is it the function function that's literally what that means so whenever you see a sign squared like this this is not being squared if it was I would have it here uh don't change your work please but watch if this was being squared I'd have it here and I'd have that as the AR that's how that would look if I don't want to say that if I want to say the functions being squared I know it's a little weird uh but people have gotten the habit of just writing it right there that's the power of the entire thing okay the entire function of sign that's being squared right now so we have this that's really a power that's an exponent we can move that to the front of course our 1/3 okay we've broken it down can we go any further do you see any products any quotients or any powers that we can move move no let's check no this well that's connected we can't separate addition we can't move that power forward we're completely done show up hands if you got that on your own that's really good you guys know what you're doing then you know just like we can expand our logarithms we can also combine them I just want to practice real quick doing one or two of those then we'll start talking about how we take derivative of these things you guys seem like really smart people so we'll cut right to the chase we'll do hardw so what I want to do here I want to combine these logarithms to see if we can get as as few logarithms as possible in our case we're trying to get one so one logarithm so let's take a look at it you know what you might have noticed is that we typically deal with our exponents last when we are expanding so here we're going to probably have to deal with some of these guys first otherwise we can't combine them does that make sense in order to find our logarithms when you when you notice those properties earlier it was log X Plus log y gives you log of x y or Ln X Plus Ln y there's no numbers up front in other words we have to move our numbers up front our coefficients to exponents first so tell me one thing you're going to do here should I deal with the 2/3 first that one we can't okay that's that's out there this is going to be the last thing we do should I deal with the five first yeah that's got to move up and the 1 half has to move up and the four has to move up so we'll leave that 2/3 it says order operations anyway really doesn't it it says 2/3 is outside deal with this stuff first put this all together then do the 2/3 so inside of our our bracket here we got an Ln of x to the 5th we've got a Ln x^2 + 1 to the 12 we got a minus Ln x - 2 all 4 power and I'll finish the FR okay let's keep on on working uh right side people you guys what's the next thing you might want to do say what M sure you can actually do both at the same time if you really know what you're doing if you know this is going to be combined by multiplication and this one's going to be combined by division we're just going to have this times this all over that just do me one favor if you're going to combine these things please don't write different logarithms it becomes one logarithm it never becomes Ln over Ln that's not the idea we're getting Ln of this argument times this argument divided by that argument all in one little piece so the 2/3 is still hanging on we got Ln well we got X to 5th we know plus is going to give us a product tell me one other thing you could do with that one half power what could you change it to if you wanted to all over you were like my little math robots there it was awesome square root there we go okay as if it's not ugly enough we can do one more thing what can we do now now that we look at that that's a coefficient right in fact I don't even really need these brackets if I didn't want them the 2/3 could go right there if that's a coefficient of a logarithm I can move that up and becomes a power now so this our very last step is Ln x to the 5th whole bunch of nasty crap and then the whole thing now with the bracket inside you do need the bracket inside to the 2/3 power okay that's about as inp as I want to get do you guys feel comfortable on expanding and combining logarithms probably some good practice right because you haven't seen it in a while could we have and that first step it would have been okay to just distribute the 23 you just would ended up with smaller exponents at the end absolutely uh you could do here and here and here and then move those up uh sorry uh here here and here and here and move those Powers up you'll notice that you get the same exact thing because well what's interesting is that that when you distribute you multiply don't you you multiply and you multiply and you multiply what do you do when you take a power to a power you how about that it's the same stuff so even if you take a power to a power you're still multiplying you get 10/3 same thing would happen here you get 10/3 okay so either way you go you'd be fine I like this way because this is all to one power that's just uh preferential though good question thank you for that one any other questions at all are you ready to move on to finally get dis calculus okay now that we've covered that we will use it trust me we'll use it a lot I want to refresh your memory on one more thing and then we're going to start talking about some integrals and get on to what in the world we're going to be doing with uh all this junk so the last thing we got to cover do you remember the graph of this function okay do you remember the graph of this function I see a lot of already let's talk about it when you take a positive number which this is uh e is approximately 2.7 you take a positive number to any power what are you gonna get out you're gonna get out a positive number that's right can you ever get out zero can you ever get out zero no so what automatically know that this function is not going to cross the x-axis it's always going to be above the xaxis does that make sense to you okay so uh how about this what if you were to plug in zero here how much would you get so we know it's going to across the y AIS at precisely 01 you said that it's always going to be above the x-axis because it's a positive number being raised to a power it has to be above here you're never going to cross this line does that make sense uh now when I plug in big numbers does this thing get really big or really small small big numbers Take 2 to 4th 2 to the e8th two this is about two this going to biger or smaller bigger bigger way bigger way faster what's going to happen over here because when you have e to the -2 which is what the these are that's the same thing as 1 over e s does that make sense when you have a negative exponent you put on the dener so as that power gets smaller and smaller more and more negative that denominator gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger one over a really big number tends to be close to zero is it never going to touch zero no but it's going to look like this that's the graph of e to the X tell me something somebody out there what's the relationship between this function and that function inverse very good they're inverses what inverses are graphically are a reflection across the yal X line so if we want to find out that graph it's really stemming from this graph and other words if I take this this diagonal right here and I just flip it right over that's going to give me Ln X so tell me if 01 is on my e to the X function if 01 is on my e to X function what has to be on my Ln X function good because inverses just flip the X and the Y did you know that about inverses that inverses really just flip the X and the Y it's a reflection across yal X so it's just flipping those coordinates really so if we have 0 1 and inverse would have 1 0 if this is astoic tox this is Asm prodct to Y which means our graph looks about like that that's the graph of Ln X you kind of need to know the graph of what we're working with because the properties are going to make a whole lot more sense to you uh for instance the very first property said hey when you plug in one you're going to get zero hello when you plug in one you get zero remember that Ln of one is always zero it's on the graph it's right there can you plug in zero to Ln do you have a calculator have you ever tried to plug in zero to Ln press Ln Zer if you have a calculator right now try it try do you have an error I got did you get if you tried it if you press ln0 hopefully if your calculator's not broken it's going to give you error what are you trying to kill me that's what it's saying you're breaking its heart really is what you're doing uh because you're supposed to know this about n can you plug in zero it's undefined it's undefined can you plug in a negative to Ln do you think it's undefined there's nothing there so when you realize what the graph looks like you kind of understand you understand a little bit better about why you can't plug in why you can't have Ln of three it doesn't make any sense you can't have Ln of Zer it doesn't make any sense Ln of one gives you zero it's on the graph so when you get a better picture of what the graph looks like Len makes a little bit more sense she H feel okay with the graphs of these things did I do it well enough for you understand where it came from fantastic now let's see how good you are how much you remember about one of our favorite things in the [Applause] world you ready R the bat man I'm going for it holy cow oh dear you didn't think it was going to be this fast did you don't wor you should know this stuff right you should know the integrals integral oh my gosh integral is the same thing as what we call an anti-derivative basically the not basically it is the inverse of a dtive just going backwards do you remember how to take the integral of something like that where we have x to the 3 DX which says in with respect to X changing add add something add one very good so the power rule backwards said well hey if you take a derivative and you subtract one you move forward and you subtract one here we're going to add one and then divide so if we did x to the 5th as a derivative and that said move this forward then subtract one we're going to do complet completely the opposite thing now we're going to add one and divide by that new exponent so this said multiply by the old exponent then subtract one this one says add one to the exponent then divide by that new exponent that's exactly how you take an integral and I'm missing one thing what am I missing why do we have a plus c what we're doing here is we're finding a family of curves that work you see that plus C when you take a derivative of any constant is going to go to zero so we have a whole family of Curves at work the only time you don't have a family of Curves with integral is if you have either a definite integral or you have an initial condition uh which we'll talk about later you okay with that one basic basic okay let's move on just a little bit what would happen if I had a constant inside of my integral always move out a constant provided it's being multiplied not added not subtracted but multiplied by whatever my function is so sure we can move that outside we can go four times the integral just like derivatives we could do this x 5th DX uh tell me left side people only just you guys tell me the integral of x to the 5th please cool okay however you want to write that's fine so we'd have four just don't forget the four x 6 / 6 + C and what we going to do with that simplify absolutely however you want to write it if you want to do the 2/3 x 6 + C or 2 x 6 over 3 I don't care whatever you want to do there fine still okay so okay stretch your brain just a little bit think back to this one oh dear now I want you to really think about what happens with derivatives before you answer this unless it's just burning in your memory you know it but please think before you answer this question integral of sin x DX integral cosine or negative cosine why isn't it positive cosine netive sign good the derivative of cosine is negative sign so if I'm trying to get a positive sign well the appropriate anti-derivative here is negative cine X watching too much scrubs Dr Cox bless bless you thank you yeah plus see exactly last one let's try that one up for size what are you going to do with that problem uh the qu quo rule works for derivatives but like where he heads that substitution oh I love substitution I love substitution if oh my gosh your teacher should have taught you this it wasn't me uh if the derivative of what you're trying to substitute is actually in the integral so find a piece of there take a derivative do you see that piece in the integral you do I hope not that gives you 4X to the 3 right I don't care about the four but do you see the X to the 3 I don't either plus is on the denominator so that would be a problem too think it easier SE top so what do you mean separated like x 4 x 2us that let's do that so this is kind of a nice trick anytime you have a single term denominator you can always separate it you always make different fractions out of that so we could do x 4x^2 - 1x^2 yeah absolutely that's fantastic tell me the next thing we're going to do someone over here on the left hand side what now simplify simplify one thing for me what do you get would be X2 on top m- One X x s but you can get X to the yeah perfect go ahead and do the the integral forming on your own see if you can get that remember that while you can split this up into integral minus integral you don't have to you can just take it piece by piece so take the integral of this piece minus the integral of this piece of course you can do negatives you can change the minus to a plus you can do it just piece by piece when you have multiple terms in there you don't have to separate it all uh by the way just a little bit of of notation for you when you do the integral and you get X 3r over 3 or 1/3 X3 you guys got that right I know this because I I saw a lot of you in the math lab some of you when you do integrals by the way what's this become one good you add one to it and you divide by whatever the new exponent is did you all get that far okay some of you like to do this some of you like to take integrals and go oh yeah I just took an integral what that symbol means is that you're supposed to take the integral whatever the argument is next if you've already done the integral this does not go here okay you've already done that so erase that you you want to stand about the notation here this is telling you what you're supposed to do this says take an integral evaluate it from 1 to two this says take an integral haven't you already done that if you want to show the evaluation the appropriate way to show it is to put it over here from one to two that's where you put that you go okay I've done the integral it's a definite integral now I'm going to evaluate from 1 to two of course we want to make it a little bit nicer looking before we do that we'll do X 3r over 3 plus one do you guys see where I'm getting the plus one overx from good cool and then we would evaluate it go ahead and evaluate it remember that when you evaluate we plug in this number first we figure out what that answer is and we subtract after we plug in that number so plug in the two figure out what you get subtract after you plug in one did you get it what' you get 116 116 double check 11 116 116 we're not going to spend a whole lot of time in here waiting for this I know you guys can do this I just want to make sure you see some finer points of doing integrals that way you don't get stuck on some of these easier ones okay don't don't make it harder than it is that's a lot with this classes about don't make it hard it is so fans be okay with our integrals okay I have one more for you give me ideas the top okay that looks pretty painless let's try that so every other time we had this we did uh let's see where were we add one divide by the new exponent are you listening add oneide by add one divide by the new exponent let's let's do that let's add one to this uh what do you get x to the well that's fine we' get one divid by that's not fine that's not fine at all that that's pretty nasty so what in the world are we going to do oh my goodness let's give up calculus 2 is over let's just go well this isn't going to work this is not good this is not good at all well let's think a little bit more about this um first things first do you know what the graph of 1x actually looks like think about it for a second do you remember what the gra of one/ X actually looks like approaches zero it does approach zero and it approaches Infinity it's like this little actually got the wrong sound effect my bad sort of thing what I'm going to do and you'll see Y in a minute I'm going to graph 1 over T you'll notice that 1 over T has a dummy variable in place of x uh you'll see Y in a second this graph if this is T and this is y looks about like that the graph looks like as I get closer to zero my number gets really really big positively as I get closer to Infinity my number gets really really small but still positive you with me okay true or false that function is continuous anything bigger than zero absolutely there's no holes there's no gaps um true or false it's differentiable anywhere past zero are there any sharp points no so this is continuous and differentiable well what that means by the fundamental theorem of calculus I'll write this out for you because 1 / T is [Applause] continuous on the interval that we're trying to talk about here by the I'm abbreviate by the fundamental theorem of calculus part one faki I made that up by faki by fundament sounds kind of cool though I think I think it'll catch on my YouTube people make sure it catches on the talking by the fundamental theor of calculus part one this thing oh sorry we must be able to find some differentiable function that gives us this thing for because this functions continuous on our domain we're looking at by the fundamental theorem of calculus we absolutely have to find some differentiable function we're going to call it capital F ofx big F ofx such this is true such that F ofx big f ofx equals the integral of our function from some defined point to X that's got to be the case if you don't believe me look up the fundamental theorem of calculus part one that's exactly what it states so this is just by definition I'm not making anything up here okay uh this says that this integral has to exist it's got to exist because it's continuous and fundamental theorem calculus part one which is proven says it exists it's got to be there also says this is just the the corollary that if I take a derivative of it that would be again since these things have to be equal it would be a derivative of this thing this you have seen before this is what you were taught in calculus one about the fundamental theorem of calculus it says when you take a derivative of an integral and you go from a defined point to x what this is is just 1 /x do you remember that yeah which is the function in terms of x these are the easy ones you had in the test where it's like oh I got a whole bunch of T's D I just put an X everywhere I see T do you remember that one it's basically what it said and now you know a little bit further what this is talking about is that if your function is continuous on this interal you have to be able to do this you have to be able to take the integral of that function uh and it it's defined it's a differentiable function and when you take of that function it gives you back your original function so uh basically it says there's got to be some function that gives me little F ofx when I take a derivative of it and the integral of little F ofx actually exists that's the basic idea here now what we do to make it just a little bit easier um we typically Define a to be one it really doesn't matter as long as it's bigger than zero and this thing works out pretty nicely so here's a couple things I want you I want to point out to you in the last five minutes you know what I'll write your too it turns out that the following things are true sorry my bad that should be a t there change your notes that needs to be a t I'm sorry you get the X when you evaluate from a to X I bet so first thing it turns out that lnx is actually equal to the integral of 1/ T from 1 to X that's a true statement it's by definition so that's a definition that we have also check this out this is where the fundamental theorem of calculus part one's going to come in watch very carefully okay did you know that you can do anything you want to to an equation as long as you do it to both sides yeah including take derivatives which is cool let's check this out if I do you believe me that this is true you have to darn you because it's a definition it's true if I take a der because it said so if I take a derivative of both sides check out what happens over here here if I take a derivative of Ln X I have to take a derivative of this nasty crap that's a little cramed sorry a little better derivative l x equals derivative do you see this piece anywhere else on the board that we' talked about what's it equal okay check it out by fundamental theorem of calculus part one we know that this is true by definition we know that this is true so by the transitive property if this we can take a derivative of both sides this equals this this part equals this oh you know what I'm going to do it I'll write over here so you have more room did I lose you do you guys have any questions on that I don't want to lose you on that one it's kind of a cool little proof um I hope it makes sense so here's what you need to know this is a really long way to say here's what it is so here's what it is is here's what you got to know the first thing yes we can now take integrals of 1 /x check it out if the derivative of Ln X = 1X that means the integral of 1x = Ln X the only thing that we have to be careful of is that we have to have an absolute value around the argument of Ln naturally we can't have an argument that's negative remember the picture remember the graph we can't have negatives in there uh so here's what we say we say this equals the Ln of the absolute value of x of course plus C that's number one thing so when you're taking the integral and you come across 1/x and you go holy crap if I add if I add one to the exponent I get zero over Z I get one over zero we can't do that well now you have something for that we've proven it over here when you take the integral of 1/x DX you get Ln absolute value of x plus C are you guys okay with that one did you get the the reason behind it if the derivative of l xal x almost the RSE is true the integral One X giv you Ln of absolute value of x if you have a definite enru the same thing is true we get Ln X from A to B if you're wondering well wait a minute Mr Leonard uh wait a second I thought you said that you had to have absolute value here check out what would have to happen for this to be integrable function you'd have to have something that doesn't go across zero do you see what I'm talking about you'd have to either have both positive both negative we're talking about both positive here so if you have both positive you're never going to have that negative argument inside the logarithm do you see what I'm talking about so we're fine as far as that goes the second part if we take a derivative of Ln absolute value of x we are going to get 1X say right here derivative of Ln X = 1X we have the absolute value so it looks a little bit more like this um really you're not going to see a whole lot of the absolute value unless you can have a function which goes negative like cosine or something okay you're going see that little bit so really this or this it doesn't really matter it's kind of all this is saying is that hey your arguments got to be positive so you make it positive should fans feel okay with with that one okay tell you what I know we haven't done a whole lot of examples we are going to get to that next time so today we're going to do a whole lot of examples with derivative of Ln last time what we learned was the expansion and the combination of natural logs we also learned a little bit of calculus behind it we learned that if we take the derivative of Ln X it's 1 /x we're going to do the integrals in just a bit but I want you to practice some of these derivatives right now before we get to it though uh there's one thing I want you to recall from your Calculus one class it was this it's if you take a derivative of some function with another function of X inside of it we called that do you remember what that was called chain rule yeah that's right this chain rule so if you remember the chain rule what the chain rule said to do was take the derivative of the outside function in this case F I call it the outside function it's just like the big function what's containing everything take the derivative of f leave the inside alone and then multiply by the derivative of the inside do you remember doing that so in in this case it would look like this it would be F Prime of G ofx youd leave that alone and then you'd multiply by the derivative of G ofx or you just say G Prime of x if you want I'm kind of mixing notation here uh one quick example if you want a really quick like little sub example here if you did like the derivative of x^2 + 1 to the thir power if I asked you for that derivative what we would do here I'm not going to ask you to to help me out on this one because you really you should know it I'm just going to go really quick through it this would be a chain rule uh some people call it the general power rule it says the big function is something a function to the third power that's the big function here do you see how it contains everything says you bring down the three like you normally would you leave the inside alone whatever's here goes here you subtract one from the power just like you normally would notice three subtract one becomes two but then you multiply by the derivative of whatever the inside function is our G of X in this case would be x^2 + 1 you guys recall that show up hands if you remember that okay and then of course you do the derivative you get 2x you pull it out front and you'd be done with our derivative I'm not going to finish that off for you but that's the idea we can do the same thing with lnx I want you to consider what's going on here if we have a derivative of Ln with some function inside of it in our case right now this F the function f is just Ln so the function Ln it takes the place of the function f right here does that make sense to you L natural log is a function so it's taking the place of f if we have any sort of function of X inside of that what we're going to do here we're going to do the chain rule the chain rule says all right well the first thing you need to consider is take the derivative of Ln what's the Der of Ln what's the Der of lnx say to do you put one over so you put one over whatever the function is in this case this is really easy because we had a function of X it was just well the Der of X is one really what you're doing here is the chain rule it says you're putting one over whatever's here so 1/x and if you think about it it's kind of weird but if you think about it if you multiply by the derivative of the inside here which is X what's a derivative of x y so you it's not hopefully it's not zero because the whole thing would go zero it is is one so we don't show that because a derivative of x is just one but that's really what you're doing here okay you're doing one over the inside times the derivative of the inside the same thing works here we're going to do one over the inside times the derivative of the inside what I want to be sure is that you guys see both Ln at work and that you see both the chain rule at work do you guys see both those things that work right now the 1 over G of X that's the same thing we're doing here this is 1 /x it just so happens we're calling the function inside G of X so one over the inside one over the inside times the derivative of the inside times the derivative of the inside that's the chain rule in respect with respect to Ln show hands you feel okay with that one okay we're going to practice that in a minute for those of you who had a different type of uh notation for chain Rule and give it to you this way as well it means exactly the same thing it's just some people like to see the U here where U is a function of X so if you have Ln of U where you is a function of X it looks just a little bit different I hope you understand it means the same thing you put one over U you can see it's the same exact thing times the derivative of U with respect to X DX same same idea just a little bit of different notation what do you say we practice some examples right now would you like that okay let's go for it uh I promise you these really aren't that hard if you keep in mind this is a chain rule what a lot of people do here is they'll they'll forget to do this part just like a lot of you in your Calculus one class when you first learned it some well maybe not a lot of you but some of you forgot to do this a lot you probably did especially with like s of 5x you know where 5x is inside I know when I taught calcul this one a lot of people forget that that's what's not cosine of 5x it's 5 cosine 5x because you have to take the derivative of the inside same thing happens here don't forget that when we're doing logarithms you still have to take the derivative of this piece it's kind of like two derivatives derivative of Ln is here derivative inside is here let's practice it [Music] [Music] okay so we got a derivative we got Ln you guys seeing what I'm talking about a function within within a function here we got a function of X inside the function Ln so the first thing that our chain rule says to do is all right take the derivative of the outside function in this this case the Ln function contains everything so if we take the derivative of Ln it says you're going to put one over I don't even care what's here you put one over whatever is on the inside so we're going to have 1 over 3x^2 - 1 looks a whole lot like this idea right now you're taking a derivative of the power but you're leaving the inside alone taking a derivative of Ln you're leaving the inside alone now what do we do leave it keep going keep going by multiplying by what sure I would like to see this work right now you guys get all advanced and you're in forc or whatever do whatever you want okay but right now I want to see you doing this that way if you make a mistake I can see where it's coming from so I want to see your work on these problems I want to see the one over this I want to see times a derivative some form you can use prime if you want I prefer the DDX because when I teach calculus I tell people hey follow the DDX wherever you have a DDX that's where you're doing derivatives that's where you're doing calculus all right so if you show that it's going to let you know what you do next so in our case we'd have derivative of Ln no problem one over the inside times the derivative of the inside this lets you know where you're doing the calculus next this you're good right there's no DDX so you're fine this you need to keep going take a derivative and then we'll put it together and be done what is the derivative of 3x^ 2us 1 what do we have there fantastic so we're going to have 1 over 3x^2 - 1 * 6 x where does the one go turns zero yeah sure the derivative of any constant always zero so we're good on that put it together make one fraction out of it I pray that you get the right answer here can I simplify anything can I start Crossing out sixes and threes it still happens sometimes I swear I still catch people this level yeah don't do that please don't do that unless you can factor out and simplify we're good uh do you all understand the first example yeah you okay with it not so bad right it's very much like chain wheel it's just you have a new function now it's not even a hard function either it's just you put one over the inside and and you're basically done let's see how much we can uh step this up okay that looks nasty enough I think we'll start there give me some ideas on what you could do with this uh true true or false let me ask you actually true or false can I move this cube root from the outside to the inside as a 1/3 power can I do that no no no no if it was 13 lnx absolutely but remember I told you about not making up your own mathematics don't make stuff up it's if it's not on one of those properties I gave you yesterday you can't do it so now I can't move move it here that's not what this is saying what this is saying is that this is supposed to be the derivative of lnx all to the 1/3 power do you guys see the difference there it's not here we can't we can't move it forward it's not an exponent of the inside of our logarithm of the argument of our logarithm it's that whole log X or lnx raised to the 1/3 power okay now you tell me what to do what do you think chain Ru chain rule I love the chain rule uh chain rule says to do you guys over here what what would you do here take the derivative outside take derivative outside do you guys see the similarity between the problem I just gave you and this problem right here or no I know there's an Ln over here but what we had here we had something to some power check it out if I cover this with my hand do I have something to some power and do the same thing what do you do with the 1/3 to the front sure I don't even care what's inside I know for a fact whatever's here if it's differentiable this 1/3 goes forward and something goes right here what goes right there 23 how do you get -2/3 what's the operation 13us on the inside what's going to go on the inside do we take the derivative of Ln now or do we take it later later okay so this we leave alone just like we left this alone we leave this alone but we're not done what's the next thing we're going to do perfect so we're going to show that right now DDX lnx so we understand well a cube root yeah it's still a 1/3 power but it's not a 1/3 power on the X3 power of the entire function here what that means that we we have a chain rule we have a general power rule we bring the one thir down no problem we taking a derivative we subtract one from it but then we don't forget that this stays the same on the inside of our function and we multiply by the derivative later of the inside of our function now this should be an easy one what's the derivative of Ln X fantastic so we got 1/3 Ln x^ -23 * 1 /x you know we can clean this up just a little bit of course this is a -2/3 which means that you can take this whole thing and put it where yeah we can do that we can change it to a cube root of this to the second power if you want so this you might be done with the calculus but clean it up just a little bit don't leave it so nasty we could have one 3x no problem we can have a cube root of lnx to the 2 that's how I'd like you guys to write it make it clean uh typically sometimes I let you do it with negative exponents most of the time I don't want negative exponents I want them nice and neat uh the only time that that's not the case if it's just a super huge uh derivative and it would just waste your time to do it so that's an appropriate answer show hands feel okay with that one fun right right lie to me right okay all right let's keep going so we know how to take derivatives of lnx we now know that the chain Rule still applies to that let's keep on working with it this is kind of good practice because it gets you back in the habit of doing derivatives and you're learning something new what do you think we're going to do first what do you think is this like a general power rule like we had last time is it a chain Rule still yes anytime you got a function instead of a function it's a chain rule pretty much anytime you do a derivative it's a chain rule sometimes it's easy because you just have X but it's always some sort of chain rule so we have Len of some function uh tell me people in the middle what's the first thing that I should write here up the L okay let's talk about it can we break up the Ln can we break up that natural laog oh remember that we can break up multiplication division and powers of the entire function inside the Ln can we break this one up can you break up addition so then we can't touch this can't touch this anyway we can't break this up because of that nasty plus there uh Ln of something plus something does not equal l n of something plus Ln of something it doesn't work if that had been multiplication of course we could but we can't do it here gcy okay so now we got to do the derivative like it is right now what would I do first one over the infin yeah that's fantastic this is a chain rule right the derivative of Ln says you put one over whatever this is I don't care what it is that's how the chain rule works for Ln so the first thing absolutely is one over just that nasty stuff do you guys understand that that is the derivative of Ln that's what that says Ln just says one over the inside that's all it means okay now to deal with the inside of it you use the chain rule so what are we going to do next the the inside perfect I'm going to change that right now so I have to do it again instead of the square root let's just make that the 1/2 power right now can you guys do that for me once youall do that take care of that derivative I'll write it on the board I want you guys to try it on your own I want to see if you got it did you get it did you guys notice that there's a double chain rule in here it's awkward right but that happens a lot in calculus we deal with one chain rule boom we got another one in there derivative of 2x is of course two we bring down the 1/2 power bring down the 1/2 power leave the inside alone subtract one from our power and then multiply by the derivative of the inside um this sort of thing you can do without showing me the extra step I want to see the extra I want to see this stuff for Ln because that's what we're learning but those other the ones that you should know already feel free to just do them quickly okay uh I don't expect that we have any issues with this I hope do we well I hope I hope not do you do you okay if you do you let me know I can cover this a little more thoroughly uh do you guys see what I'm talking about though the chain rule at work we have bring down leave it inside uh subtract one and multiply by the derivative inside after this it's kind of your job to clean this up I'm not going to do any more work on this particular problem what I suggest this this gets really messy really fast when you have multiple chain rules especially with these negative exponents this right here of course you can move this to the denominator I'll show you one more step but the rest of it honestly is just some algebra you could do 3x^2 over 2 < TK x cubus one do you see how that works yeah we can bring this down that's a negative power that's a square root X - 1 this 2 is on the denominator 3x2 goes numerator of course you have to show me the parentheses there that's important but in order to make this one fraction you'd have some work to do you'd have to get common denominator here and then put those two things together that's kind of up to you um I would say that this would be fine for for one of my answers in class uh in the back of the book like when you're checking your work or whatever it might not look like this most of the time they do the extra work uh they make the comma denominator they distribute they combine like terms they make one fraction out of it so if you want to get yourself really good at algebra try doing stuff like that you guys okay with this one so far so calculus is done the only thing you'd have to do now just a little bit of algebra y'all have any questions or can I move on move on WE you good yeah am I going too fast for you you okay all right tell you what we'll do about U three more of these just to get your heads wrapped around some of these other Concepts I want you to know uh we'll talk about a new technique that uh you probably haven't ever seen before we'll talk about implicit differentiation then we'll do log LS oops oh dear here we go first things first here let's look at our problem uh when you're doing derivatives or integrals it's really good to spend some time and diagnose what's going on sometimes these are going to be pretty easy but you still want to think about them what's the big idea on this derivative does Ln contain everything in this problem then it's not a good idea to start with Ln first it's a first good idea to start with say it again product yeah yeah a product contains all of this you guys see it we have X Cub anytime you have something in front of Ln works just like something in front of parentheses is being multiplied so there's a product right there do you you remember you remember remember the product rule yeah show me the product rule here go for it write it out product has a p in it plus has a p in it so product plus so product will you're going to have to add something together so I'm going to show my work that way you see where things coming from product work works like this you do the derivative of the first times the second plus the first times the deriva of the second some people do it backwards some people do the first times der of the second plus the second times der of the first or whatever I prefer this way just that's the way I grew up learning it derivative of the first times the second plus the first times the derivative of the second did you remember it if you didn't that's okay we're just starting here but relearn it right now because you're going to use it a lot all right again say what now say that again the derivative of the first time the second derivative of the first * the second plus the derivative of the second Plus time first sure yeah something like that something like that it's one of those things derivative of the first times the second plus the first times the derivative of the second derivative of the first one times the second one plus the first one leave it alone times a derivative of the second one so you take a derivative of one of them you leave one alone add take a derivative of the other one leave the other one alone oh the quotient is the quotient first happens when you have a right uh low D High minus high D low Square the bottom away we're done wait that's the quo rule that's the quo rule I remember it works for quotients product rule for products but product rule you're your derivative of the first times the second plus the the first times the Der of the second add them together that's the idea I don't really care the order in which you go U make sure you're taking the derivative of one of these factors multiply by the other one one add take a Dera of the other Factor multiply by the first one that's the idea now the derivatives themselves should be pretty straightforward uh you let me know X Cub what's the Dera of X Cub 3 sure so 3x2 you'll notice we leave Ln 5x alone we don't do anything with that then we have this add we have X cubed time how about the derivative of Ln 5x what do we have to use there chain rule so chain rule here says what perfect times sure I'm going to show it right now just so we get used to doing that times the derivative of 5x some people forget to do this if you forget to do this you can change your problem a lot you have a a one over five instead of 1x okay you you have something you have something different here so three x^2 Ln 5x no problem plus how much is that what happens to our fives that's what I mean about you have a 1 when you're not supposed to how about our X's simplify the things that you can so if we have x to the 3 here and we have an X down here we can simplify that sorry I know I I did a whole lot of simplification all at once uh but if you need this one more time the derivative of 5x is 5 simplify the fives we still have an X we have x to the 3r that makes x to the 2 show F be okay with that one what's one more thing you could do if you felt like doing some extra math here what could you do take out the X squ good you could Factor it that's right you could Factor this out and get 3 Ln 5x + 1 x^2 on the outside uh do I care not really if you get a different answer in the back of the book maybe that's what they do uh so just be aware of that can we move on do you guys have any questions at all are you getting your brains a little bit un cobwebbed with some of this stuff it's going to take some time it is uh but don't worry about it right now you will you'll get there okay derivative Ln absolute value cosine x one thing I want you to notice is that sometimes we have absolute value around our function and sometimes we don't um really when it comes down to it don't worry about it because when I gave you the definition the very first time you don't need to write this you already have in your notes when I gave you the definition the first time I really gave you the definition of Ln absolute value of x is 1 /x so we don't really need to worry all that much about those absolute values it's just there to make sure that you it's telling you hey don't worry you don't have any negatives inside of your natural log function because we can't have those of course cosine has positive and negative correct so when they give this to you they're saying we're just focusing on positive cosine that's what we're talking about all right so don't worry too much about that but let's worry more about doing this derivative first thing Ln is the overarching function it contains everything here so let's take the derivative of the Ln you got y'all should be pretty good at this by now we've done a few examples what's the first thing I'm going to write one over cosine X is absolutely true yeah for sure 1 / cosine X you'll notice there's no more absolute value the derivative of absolute value X is 1x so that goes away don't no need to worry about that one are we done no this is what again sure so we're going to do the derivative we should be pros of this derivative of cosine X come on come on oh I heard some people say the nasty one and some people say the right one I know it's it's it's sign somehow right is it positive or negative negative very good so this is going to be 1 over oops that's not right 1 cosin x * sinx let's put that together we got sinx over cosine X say it again perfect that's tangent this this is tangent so this isga tan X cool that was interesting wasn't it so sometimes these logarithm functions of sign functions gives us other sorry logarithmic functions of U trigonometric functions gives us other triat functions it's kind of weird but a lot of those relationships show up with Ln it's really interesting can we do one more is this good practice for you are you getting something out of it I hope all right good I don't want to waste your time or my time should I stop there no don't worry I haven't gone crazy I know right it's crazy now I think you'll agree that looks pretty bad to start with right does to me at least go my goodness gracious that's not fun well I want you to think about what we can do and why we did the whole yesterday's lesson on uh learning how to expand and combine logarithms in every other example that we had before we can't expand it can't we could have but it really wouldn't have done anything here because that's pretty easy we couldn't really expand it for anything reasonable definitely can't expand that can we expand this one the more that you do the easier that your derivative becomes so expand these as much as you can then do derivative of each little piece man these become way easier uh I'm I'm going to kind of cheat here I'm going to do the whole expansion in my head right now hopefully you can follow me along we're going to talk about it though so stick with me notice the LNS over the entire thing you need that what do you do with this division how do you separate that so we're going to subtract off another Ln of this piece are you with me yeah okay what are we going to do about this product right here so we're going to subtract or we're going to add another Ln on there so we're going to have Ln of this plus Ln of this minus Ln of this okie dokie maybe I'll do two steps for you notice one thing um when you're breaking up your Ln or your logarithms you're not doing derivatives you're not doing any calculus at all so you still need that DDX we're not doing anything right now except using the properties of logarithm so please maintain this until you actually take the derivative once you take the derivative of course get rid of it so we got Ln of X2 no problem plus + Ln 2x^2 + 1 all to the 3 powerus Ln of 5 - x^2 under root we'll make sure that's in the bracket because we want to take the d entire thing let's make sure I'm right am I right this plus this one because we had a product minus this one because we had a quotient okay uh should I stop here or should I keep going keep going the more you do the easier this becomes so let's keep on going what should I do square square fantastic what else going to square root up square root okay so that's a 1/2 power I'm going to move that to the front Cube Cube to the front let's do this so every one of these arguments has an exponent let's move to the front let's look and see what we did um you should know that when you take derives you can take derivative of each individual piece as you go is this derivative easy or hard easy that's a piece of cake this one easy pretty easy involves a little chain rule but not a big deal this Oney also easy we just made something that looks really nasty into three really easy pieces really easy pieces that's nice try that when you get to those heavy duty ones in a home you go oh my gosh what in the world see if you can split them up now don't split up things that you're not supposed to for instance can I split this up no it's got a plus this one no it's got a minus I can't touch those but we definitely want to be putting our expon for it I definitely want to be separating products and quotients still okay so far okay question you I don't think so when you bring down that okay remember that right now we still have this DDX out front it's telling us we're not doing derivatives yet we're not touching calculus all this was was logarithm properties so all this was was hey remember how we brought the three down we're not subtracting it because that's where exponents go remember how that's a 1/2 power we're bringing down the 1/2 power we're not subtracting CU we're not doing a derivative right now now is the time where we take a d question I think what you subraction for the to it and it was exponent so would it be an addition like at the bottom no it doesn't matter um like when we did something like this Ln X Y we do Ln xus Ln y this takes care of the negative exponent for us do you see why you could actually write this Ln x * y y1 correct you can separate this by Ln X Ln y1 that's an exponent that goes down in front lnx minus Ln y That's why that works okay that's actually a little proof for you didn't want to have to show that but there you go does that make sense okay now we you to do derivatives what I want you to do is practice this do the derivative of this piece this piece and this piece it's nothing fancy it's just little chain rolles so show that to me and I'm going to do it over here for you okay do yall get it already yeah felt good all right you I got space over oh let me think so derivative means that because I can split up derivatives by addition I can do that for for derivatives uh I get to do derivative this and then this and then that so I know I've got 2 * the derivative remember with with constants you don't need a product rule uh if you did the derivative of two would be zero so that would kind of eliminate half of your product rule anyway you don't need it for constants only functions of x times functions of X so no product rules here on any of this 2 * 1X no problem 3 * again that's a constant we have 1 2x^2 + one one over the inside times the derivative of the inside three stays there derivative of Ln of this nasty junk we put one over the inside time derivative of the inside minus again we leave the2 there derivative Ln 5 - x^2 well we do one over the inside time derivative of the inside let's see what we got I know I can put that together that's 2x I know that this what's the Der of that one so I got 4X * 3 that's going to give me 12x over this stuff none of it simplifies so that's going to be part of my answer you guys two for two did you get both of them Dam how much is this derivative what's that give you so this is let's write that this would be 4X that's how we got the 12x this you said this is what okay so if we put this together hopefully I'm not going too fast for you -2 pos2 minus what's the sign going to be for this fraction posi yeah sure minus and negative gives us a plus 2 over 2 those simplify out so we're not going to have a a two in here we're going to have one over this that's it X say what now oh yeah X X's aren't really that important are they I mean yeah okay you're right I forgot so X over 5 - x^2 did I miss anything else let's let's double check 4X * 3 that gives us our 12x this stuff doesn't change twos are gone minus with the negative gets to plus X over 5 - x^2 we got that that's as good as I want how many people got that one that's good if you did that you know what you're doing okay um if you didn't if you struggled a little bit this is one of those times when before you start your homework you should go back through your notes do the problems that we've done in class like don't just follow them actually do them like different sheet of paper put your notes aside see if you can do them do them until you can get it right and then start your homework I promise it'll be a whole lot easier if you can do that okay if you jump right into your homework you go I'm a little overwhelmed because you never really learned the material you need to learn the stuff before you try the homework okay you with me the homework's there to kind of beat it into your head so you get the repetitive nature of this okay are you ready for something a little bit new this thing this is cool I promise you're going to like this this is this is nice you you really will I do at least I think you like you're going to like it um what this is called this next little piece we're going to talk about is called logarithmic differentiation so when they ask you for that and you go what in the world is logarithmic differentiation that sounds horrible it's really not horrible it's actually not fun uh this is what they're talking about and it stems from this idea let's suppose that we have some sort of a a function like this one question is this still 6.1 sure is I'll let you know when we change we got a function like this one that well we could probably take the derivative of that couldn't we just like it is I think I could you guys had it earlier what you could do what what what could you do here quo rule would have to be done then then you'd have a chain Rule and you'd have a chain rule but you can do it uh it's not going to look very pretty but you could you could definitely do it but there's another option if you have some of these derivatives you go man that's it's kind of nasty and they get way this is kind of an easier example to do this with but then get really nasty okay especially if I had like another function of X up here you'd have a quotient rule then a then a product rule inside the quotient rule then some chain rules it' get nasty really really fast sometimes we can get around that and here's how you do it the way that you do is called logarithm differentiation what you need to know is that you can do anything you want as long as you do it to both sides of an equation practically anything you want well one of those things that we could do looks a little weird but one of those things we can do we can actually take an Ln of both sides of our equation can someone out there explain to me why this would actually help us here aha if I taking Lon on both sides this doesn't help us very much but this does because I can separate it I can expand it all out are you with me yeah okay so what we're going to do before you start showing me derivative before you start showing DDX or doing anything like that you're going to expand this thing so no DDX is right now we expand it first so what that means is Ln y equals well let's see what we can do we got a quotient here what's a quotient change to everybody real quick subtraction very good do we have any products here no but we have some exponents we have a four and we have a cool so I'm going to do all that right now so we got Ln 4 * Ln of x -1 -3 Ln 2x -1 can you guys double check me make sure I did that right okay cool is that as expanded as we can get yes can we break this up please please goodness say say no can you break that up how about this one no we can't we can't separate subtraction so this four came forward no problem this we have subtraction 1/3 came forward no problem now we're ready to take a derivative do you remember doing implicit differentiation y Prime yeah we're going to have y primes everywhere you touch a function of Y you get that y Prime I like the dydx because that's how I grew up with the liven this notation but here's the idea check this out with me we're going to do a derivative of both sides so here and here you'll notice that our derivative is with respect to X which means that we treat y as a function of X what that means is that we do our derivative just like normal so the derivative of Ln Y what would the Der of Ln y be very good but check this out because this is a function of X we have to show the chain rule it is a chain rule here so what this looks like is 1 over y for sure but check this out why you get the Y Prime why and I don't really really like the Y Prime because notation wise it kind of fails you here but notice you would do a derivative of the inside does that make sense you'd have hey one over y this is the the Der of Ln times the derivative of y look at this this is dy DX that's what that is that gives you your derivative so I'm going to go down here and give you Dy DX that's this side that that's all you got to do so we have how do you take a Dera l and y no big deal it's one over y just like always but then you do a chain rule derivative of y hey that's it that's your derivative this is what we're going to solve for in just a second now let's do the derivative of this side this should be pretty easy I want you guys to do it go for it we'll do one more and we'll call it good uh for today's lesson oh goodness uh oh did you were you able to do this derivative yeah should get 4 -1 did you get 4 -1 we do the chain rule but the derivative of x -1 is simply one so this is 4X -1 minus well we got a 1/3 here we've got a 1 over 2x - 1 because we're taking a derivative Ln but now we do have a chain rule don't forget about the chain rule my goodness derivative of the inside gives you what how many people made it that far that's cool that's great it's fantastic let's clean this up a little bit a couple things need to happen firstly we have a 4X -1 we've got a 2 over three don't forget parenthesis here we get a 2x- one can you distribute that just make it you can you can distribute it U generally people don't typically distribute denominators because if you have to create a common uh denominator it's easier to do it when it's Factor okay CU here you you distribute but then to find a common denom you have to Factory so typically people don't do that it's not a big deal if you do or not okay now the last thing if you'll notice this we haven't solve for our derivative yet we have 1 y * dydx what you need to do when you're doing this process solve it for dydx this stands for your derivative so if you get this by itself you're done tell me how can I get this piece by itself fantastic so if I multiply by y and multiply this whole thing by y well these are gone that's cool we get dydx equals I'm going to leave all this stuff the same 4X -1 2 over 3 2x - 1 time y okay I want to show of hands real quick if you're okay with what we've done so far in the problem good that's fantastic now question for you is it appropriate if I can change the Y should I leave the y the way it is or would you rather see function of X right now this is implicit if I can solve for an explicit derivative that's a little bit bit better look back at our problem do you know how much Y is equal to yes do you you should how much is y that that bunch of crap hey look at that we got it so all you got to do I know it's fun told you it was fun day sure we took L on both sides that's so that we can split all this junk up okay we split all the junk up we took a derivative after that notice here's our DDX this is where you do calculus calculus this side is implicit calculus this side is pretty easy put it together as much as you can solve for your derivative whatever that is if you used y Prime no problem solve for y Prime solve for dydx here by multi applying y on both sides now just make a substitution this should be explicitly defined somewhere in fact it's right here so this piece goes here if we do that then we're done um I really don't care how nice you make this you're going to find out that your derivatives can look quite different uh from the back of the book um right now I'm not trying to get you to be super excellent at algebra I'm putting this stuff together you really should know that so you should know how to find common denominator and put that together okay I'm trying to get you to be good at the calculus part of it um and that's that's really our our goal here so I'm going to leave it with these two fractions you need to know that you can manipulate it a little bit so we'd have 4x - 1 - 2 over 3 2x - 1 big old bracket and then we multiply by however much the Y is equal to since the Y is this stuff that's what we put on the back end my test reasons will you mark us down for not doing the Y what it equals two or like but y absolutely I do want the Y Prime is is perfectly fine but I do need you to notice that this is a function of X this should be substituted back for I don't want you to leave it why I want you because this is what logarithmic differentiation is it's kind of going around the derivative but still getting a proper derivative in terms of X okie dokie are you guys okay with this idea question so if we leave it like that and don't do the algebra we're fine this is fine for me I need to tell you that in the back of the book uh typically what they'll do is they will find a common genom they'll put this together it's going to look a little bit different because they want one fraction if possible do you see what I'm talking about if they get one common denominator put this together then you could make one fraction out of it I'm not going to spend the time to do that because we could spend all day doing things like that so F be okay with it okay now the last thing we're going to talk about we got about two minutes here I want to show you something like this I don't know how much we're going to get through um I'll probably just go pretty pretty quick at it but I want you to think through this uh firstly can you think about this as an implicit problem do you guys see that we have x's and y's all tied together and we can't really get them separated okay there is one thing that we can do to make a problem easier what is it you have it it's in your head I can see it the Ln separate yeah the Ln absolutely let's separate that thing that makes our problem easier do you guys see it so we would do Ln 2x - Ln y - sin y + x^2 = 0 that's as much that's as easy as we can get it okay we can't do anything really substantial to make this problem any easier we could separate these but it wouldn't make a difference because that's a constant who cares derivative that thing going be pretty py so we would take a derivative of both sides now would it be easier to separate the x's and y's on their respective sides you can it doesn't really matter you're going to do it at one point or another okay so here I'm going to be kind of quick about this I I really don't want to keep you over so uh derivative of Ln 2x can you tell me what that is 2 2x sure it's 2 2x it's 1 2x * 2 because we have the chain rule here we have -1 over y * y Prime if you like the prime notation that's y Prime minus derivative of sign everybody der of sign real quick so we would have cosine y but check this out please please because you took a der of Y you're going to have a y prime plus this one der of x^2 is perfect D of zero cool 2x cosine y y Prime 1 y y Prime 2's are gone we get 1/x all you have to do now get all your x's on one side Factor your y Prime just like implicit differentiation does and you're done so let's see if we do that we're going to have a 1 y * y Prime cosine y * y Prime on the right hand side we have a -2X - 1X how' you get um what I do you put 1X Plus what are you talking about just checking as soon as you have your y Prime terms on one side and everything else on the other side this is when you want to factor out your y Prime and then just a so break I guess the long story short break down the LNS as much as you can break them down then start taking derivatives whether you need logarithmic differentiation okay whether you need implicit differentiation okay if it's implicit you're not going to get many of these but if it's implicit make sure you take and do a y prime or dydx everywhere you take a derivative of y get all those terms to one side everything else on the other side Factor y Prime divide typically and you're done um this this answer by the way it can look different you need to know something about this you can multiply and get a common denominator you multiply get a common denominator do a complex fraction on that and it's going to look a little different what I want to know is is everyone okay getting down to at least this far so you are yes is it making sense to you yes okay so we don't all right so now it's time to keep going with our our natural logarithms we've learned all about the derivatives we did a lot of examples from that now we're going to start talking about integrals so if you remember the first thing I actually proved other than just the properties of logarithms was the integral and derivative of that so what we should have down I think you guys already have this but we'll talk a lot about it today our goal was to find out what in the world happened when I take an integral of something like 1 / U we tried that right right we did it at first and like man this didn't work like the normal way we we were to do this we can't make this U to the1 and then add one to it because we get U to the 0o we get one over Z that's a big problem so we said well well how else how are we going to do that so we did the uh the whole Ln thing we said well this really this really is Ln of the absolute value of U plus C do you remember the absolute value that we had okay so that's the integral that we're we're talking about integral of one over U gives you Ln absolute value of U plus C that's what we're working with today what I want to do is just practice a few very basic examples with a little bit of substitution for right now and we'll gradually gradually work our way up to some trig functions um and see how that works for us you guys ready yeah so first thing let's consider in integral of 1 5x - 2 DX now if you remember back to your integrals your idea was and we haven't really learned any integration techniques yet you're still in the same boat the same the boat being you either have to have something that's directly on your table remember the integration table you guys have I know some of you had the little sheet out right now uh either if it's something directly on your table like X 3r or just secant squar or something like like that or you have to substitute to make it fit your table well here's one more thing that we have added to our table so if we can make it look like this then we can do the integral does this look exactly like this no it doesn't so if it doesn't look like that we've got to make it look like that what's a good way to make it look like that subti substitution is fantastic remember how substitutions work substitutions work when you look at a part that you don't like in your problem like this I don't like that part and the derivative of this part has to be somewhere in your function disregarding the constants so what's the derivative of this five but there's no X's right so that's cool we can pull fives out in front that's the idea we're going to make a substitution to make this guy look like this guy so our substitution here has to be U = 5x - 2 let's see well oh you know what I want you to practice that too what do we do when we do a substitution what's the next step yeah okay cuz we got to we have to not only substitute for this but we've got to change this as well this has to match up with whatever variable you are substituting for so yeah we need a du equals mhm 5 DX um I learned it this way you guys can do your substitution however you want I learned to solve for DX so you'll always see me doing du over 5al DX some people have done it other way it's fine I don't care what way you do it okay uh so we'll do a substitution we still have a one uh what does the 5x - 2 become good and instead of DX I put perfect what do you typically do with that five move it out to the yeah that way it doesn't affect any of your makes it more difficult or anything makes it a little easier so 1/ integral of 1 U du we want to make sure this matches this your variables have to match did we make it look good now does it fit part of our table y that's fantastic that's the whole idea here so uh don't trick yourself and thinking these things are ridiculously hard right now pretty much all you have all you know is it either fits your table or you substitute to make it fit your table that's about it so we did a little substitution I know the 1 stays there that doesn't affect anything everybody integral of one to U du is Ln good absolute value is important plus C sure you put that now or you can put at the very end it really doesn't matter there is one thing that is important though what variable did we start with an x what variable do we have now that's a problem so what are you going to do put X back in yeah so if we have this substitution U = 5x - 2 that U becomes 5x - 2 so our integral is 1 Ln 5x - 2 in absolute value plus C okay that's our first example it's a really simple one but I want to make sure that you guys are okay with it show fans if you are you feel okay with that one perfect fantastic let's step it up just a little bit I want you to know that we're not always substituting just to make an Ln sometimes we're going to have a sorry I one over you to get a integral that equals Ln sometimes you'll have Ln in our integral so let's practice one of those to all right looks a little scary but let's look at it the first thing you should do whenever you do an integral is to see if it fits your table is this anywhere in an integration table that you know of no it looks pretty nasty actually there's a square root there's an lnx it's got a fraction that's all the bad stuff at once right that's no good but then we think if it doesn't fit the integration table we should look to make uh sub that's right let's make a substitution here the appropriate substitution is one that's typically inside another function it's usually like a denominator or it's inside parenthesis or it's inside a root it's usually inside something and the derivative has to be there disregarding constants so let's look at the appropriate substitution is the appropriate substitution 3x no no the derivative of that is three I don't that's not going to help us with our Ln is the appropriate substitution the square root of lnx with the square root yeah it's typically not the whole function guys it's typically the inside of a function you you take the ugly part out now here's what I mean by that look if you had a u in here if you had a u could you take the integral of U to the 1/2 power yeah so don't worry about that square root also the derivative of lnx I'll think back to yesterday the Der of Ln X is here's a one do you see it here's a 1x that's something that we're looking at so you want the derivative to be in there and typically they use the inside of some other function so let's try it = lnx and you already told me that when we take our derivative we're going to get du = 1 /x DX again I always solve for DX you don't have to but you can If I multiply both sides by X I get X dual DX do you guys see what I'm talking about about your derivative has to be there because right now when we subtitute this in for DX our X's are going to go by by and what you have to have is all one type of variable and that's got to match up your du or DX or whatever you have you guys ready to do the rest so let's see uh you tell me what I'm going to have do I still have a square root yes sare root of you inside that square root is M denominator I got a 3X still I haven't changed changed that yet but I have an X du yeah that's right the x is due so X's are gone that's fantastic we had to have that happen if that doesn't happen you've made the wrong substitution okay you have to get rid of all the other variable or be able to substitute for it in a different way you have to have these things match up and have no other extraneous variables going on tell me one other thing two other thing that things that we're going to do on this problem 1/3 goes out what else perfect square root to 12 mhm so 1/3 no problem we've already got rid of our X's that was a big deal We've Got U to the 12 power du be careful when you're doing your integrals remember that we're always adding one we're not subtracting that's a derivative so when we do our integral here we got 1/3 no problem we've got U to [Music] the 2 23 Goodtimes 2/3 where we getting the 2/3 from I'm going to show it here this would be over 3es but then what you know is you got a complex fraction the two just moves to the numerator so really we've got 1/3 * 23 U to the 3es nothing simplifies here we've got hopefully I did it right 2 n u to 3 plus C yes and we're done right you got to put the we're not done we're close to done we're almost done the last thing we got to do is make sure that if we've done a substitution you got to substitute back for it so since we did all the way back over up here we're going to put this back for this that we'll be done by the way is my math all right yes okay good so we've got 2 9ths yeah lnx we'll just move that three halves up like that around the whole thing uh one one quick question can can I move this three Hales to the front yes or no yes or no what do you think can okay so question is this the same as this no no okay this one you can this one you can't this is the whole function raised to the power does that make sense to you yeah okay so be careful on that again don't invent your own mathematics please plus C that's done show be okay with that one boom fantastic that's really I'm only going to give you two of these ones they're pretty basic you're typically going to use a substitution you're either going to have something like one over U uh to substitute or sorry after substitution or you can substitute lnx see if you can work around with that of course I can't give you every type of example you're going to have but these two cover a lot of bases here so look for substitutions try to make it fit something that's in your integration table now the next one next one the now now gets fun this is the good stuff I know you've been waiting for it I know you've been waiting for the trigonometry right right am I right yeah I know well so far here's what here's a couple of them that you know we know this one and this one and this one and we know I going just do a few just these ones for right now you know this one let's practice see what you guys know um let's start with this one what's that how about that one good oh you guys are good at this some of you in the math lab took my advice and actually learned these when I told you to that's fantastic how about good D okay thanks one of us there's a couple other ones uh what's another give me another one I think you got cosecant cotangent yeah that's the one and then squ what's this one that's right and then the last one should be uh cosecant squ right yeah let's see if secant s = Tan x cose s should equal Co something Coan negative negative that's right that right now is your integration table for trigonometric functions I believe that's about all that's on there right we're going to create some more right now so this is what you're kind of expected to know uh coming in this class everyone from your verbal responses knew these ones yay uh but these ones are a little bit harder to memorize because we don't use them as often we're going to use these okay we're going to use them so get used to them uh write this down have that in your your memory banks you okay okay now what we don't see up here is stuff like this one we don't see the integral of tan X if you've wondered why in the world don't we ever see the integral of tan X why couldn't we deal with that well we're going to find out right now why you couldn't deal with that in calculus one so uh give me some ideas on how we might go go about now that we know some of the stuff that we do know how we we might go about solving this particular intergal what would you want to do first good we use an identity uh you'll find out that with trig you use a lot of identities I wasn't lying to some of you who came to me earlier and said what do I need to know learn your identities learn your identities because we're going to use a lot of them so yeah let's bring it up tangent is sinx over cosine X go through the steps I'm talking about here now we're going to look at this does this fit doeses this fit over here exactly no does it everybody does it fit over here exactly no no it doesn't look exactly the same if it doesn't look exactly the same then you're going to use substition yeah you're going to make a substitution to make it look the same okay well let's do a substitution here now it's true that the derivative of sign is here but if I solved for it it wouldn't cross it it wouldn't simplify that out of the problem so you being sign's probably not a good choice We want to pick the worst part of this and call it u in our case right here we're going to pick U equals the coine cosine X do you guys see what I'm talking about about the worst part of this being uh being cosine is on the denominator also it's a great part for us because if I do the derivative the derivative of cosine is and besides the negative the sign parts right there that's something we're going to be able to simplify out so that's a good choice so dual s x DX you know me I do du over sinx = DX let's see what this does uh do we still have a sign well it depends on how you do the integral for me yeah I still do because I I like to do this do we still have a cosine what's our cosine do we still have a DX no du for me or sorry DX for me is Du over negative sinx our signs are gone tell me a couple things that we're going to do that so this is negative integral 1 / U man that made it a lot nicer can we do the integral no you can we can now because we learned about what the um we learned about that thing what's that thing we learn about Ln that's right we learned about natural law so notice we do have the negative Ln of you're forgetting something absolute value absolute value is absolutely important okay that's that's cool we're almost done let's go one more step I think someone else said that already you can't just leave it in terms of you what are we going to put in place of our U so this equals I'm going to go right over here so it looks better this equals negative Ln absolute value cosine X plus C show be okay with that one isn't that interesting did I I think I told you I think I prefaced this last time and said it's weird but a lot of trig functions get related to Ln somehow don't you it's interesting isn't it that when you take the integral of tangent you somehow get Ln of absolute value negative Ln absolute value of cosine you guys okay with that one it's pretty straightforward right now there's one more thing that we're going to do here what does this count as what does that mean an exponent that is an exponent so if this is a negative one then really what we can do we can move that as an exponent so this is Ln absolute value cosine X to the 1 tell me something how much is that equal to you should know it one over cosine very good this is one over cosine one / cosine is also known asant that's right so we get another identity for us what we know now is that the integral of tan X DX is equal to Ln absolute value see X plus C some people out there might be wondering wait a second um isn't this a problem because is if I plug in if I plug in Pi / 2 that's zero are you with me you should know your trig right if I plug in pi over two you get zero so wouldn't this be one over Z isn't that undefined and answer is yeah would be until you consider where this is coming from tangent is not even defined at pi/ 2 it's continuous and it's defined between not including pi2 and pi2 remember those S curves that you get so we don't really have to worry about the pi/2 because you would even be able to integrate It Anyway does that make sense to you okay you might not have thought of that but there it is so we got another one so we got these ones now we got integral of tangent equals Ln absolute value see X plus C here's the the deal in this class once you prove something you don't have to keep redoing it so next time you see the integral of tangent or you see something that has a tangent in there don't reinvent the wheel don't you don't have to break it up into sign over cosine we just did it anything that we prove in class like this one you can use so now use that keep that in mind next time you do your homework you go oh okay how about the uh you know we're not going to do this one but how about the integral of x tan x^2 DX well you're thinking uh substitution for the X now that's in your table you're good to go does that make sense makes a whole lot easier than having to go through this all the way over again and again you guys want to see one more did you like that one it's kind of interesting right it's kind of fun uh tell you what we'll do run out of room here I think we can do this this one's tricky it's it's really tricky it It's tricky because we use a trick here that I I wouldn't expect you to know I didn't know it until I saw it so if you're like well where's that coming from so was I the first time okay what we're going to do here is we're going to multiply by one in a really really unique way we're going to change the look of this thing and we're going to change the look so that we can use a substitution that actually makes sense because right now doing the one over coine thing we're going stuck in a right because if you do one over Co are you familiar with the one over cosine here that I'm talking about you do one over cosine you do a substitution for cosine to get the one over you it doesn't the sign doesn't eliminate so you'd be stuck in a right back and forth and back and forth It's like Catch 22 okay so we're going to do a nice little trick here instead of just having secant x what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep the secant x and I'm going to multiply by see X Plus tangent X on both the numerator and denominator if you're like Leonard what in the world are you doing it's a trick that we're going to use to create a substitution all right I know it looks weird it's like where how would you even come with that I didn't come with it myself honestly I read it out of the book I'm like oh man these tricky guys you son of a gun you did it well here's the deal and you're going to see it right away as soon as we distribute this numerator notice numerator gets distributed denominator does not so we have here see 2 X Plus SEC tangent uh sorry seing X tangent X you guys okay with the distribution yes no se Square see tangent here's why we did that I want you to look at what's the worst part of this what's making this harder than it needs to be the denominator is the denominator is the bad part here if we do a substitution for this what's the derivative of secant squ oh yeah what's derivative of tangent oh sorry I had these backwards but what's the derivative of secant that one what's the derivative of tangent so if we do it together we're going to get that whole piece out of it does that make sense we're inventing a substitution here it's a little awkward cuz yeah it's hard to see it it's wow how in the world but someone figured it out and we're just going to use it so if we do U equals the denominator SEC X Plus tangent X and we do a derivative again let's try this derivative of see X everybody what is that very good plus so we did this this is that part plus that's right C squ I'm going to do the substitution the different way some of you are familiar with this uh you look here you go okay DX I try to look for this stuff too do you guys see that this is this whole part right here yeah that's our substitution that's awesome I love this game so we do a substitution we have tell me what the integral is now what's on the numerator one yeah one one's or du sure over what what did we call this U and then this whole thing became that du so you either have du over U or you have one over U du either way is fine can we do the integral now can now it's a piece of cake Ln absolute value of U plus C no problem the only that we're going to do is what put the U Back yeah put it right back in there so what we know now is that the integral of secant x DX got it from there is Ln absolute value remember this was our U see X Plus tangent X plus C that's the reason why you didn't get a whole bunch of these things in your Calculus one class is because you can't do them you can't do them until you learn about what the integral of one over you is once you do that the whole world opens up for you as far as trigonometric integrals uh did I explain this well enough for you show hands if I did you're okay with that one what I'm going to do now I'm not going to prove all of them I'm just going to complete this list for you that way you have the entire thing okay so we just did tangent we just did secant there's a couple of those I want to give you so as add on to whatever list you have the following things first one we already did we know that the integral of tangent U du is Ln absolute value see U plus C is that's not the same thing as saying x uh you know it is the same the reason why they have it as you is to let you know that you can make a substitution change it into that so you can put it X or a u um actually all of these should probably be used I think it's that way in the integration table in your book or whatever you're using um my bad I just did them on top of my head so I used X because I'm used to it um use X or youu interchangeably the reason again why they're using U here is to let you know that a substitution is possible in them so don't forget about that other words one we didn't do we didn't do coent U but I hope that you understand it would be really really similar to tangent all you'd have is cosine over s you do practically the same thing and you're going to get this this one we did do this one we did do did right over there so this would be Ln absolute value see U plus tangent U plus C and last one again the uh gu see what I'm talking about about the cotangent would look really the proof would look really really similar to this one well the cosecant proof would look really really similar to this it's it's a it's similar to that one so we'd have Ln absolute value cose U minus Cent U and there's some similarities here uh instead of secant we get cosecant instead of tangent we get Cent the plus we get minus it's kind of like the reverse of all of my suppos if you wanted to call it that show fans feel okay with with these ones I'm not going to prove them uh the proofs are really similar so you can either do them on your own look them up I think some of them are exercises for you what I do want to do is two examples to illustrate how you would go about doing these would you like to see some yeah okay so you guys like tattoos right just get an arm tattoo it'd be the coolest thing like ever no can you rip your arm off then yes do it I won't give you extra credit but you'll be awesome just tell them it's some sort of like I don't know Japanese writing most people w't know the difference some says honor and strength I did have a student once who came to school I got to tell the story came to school like he wore the same shirt like I think three times in the class and it was Japanese writing he was not Japanese so hey what's your shirt me he goes oh I really don't know and so I had two Japanese students I'm like do you know what this he left class uh to use restroom something I said do you know what that shirt means like yeah I said what's it mean I don't want to tell you like no come on tell me it means I want a girlfriend so funny he had no idea classic that that was a funny day I never told him I never told him what I meant any I don't want to make fun of them that would be mean f of okay so let's start with our problem does it look exactly like something in our integration table uh yeah no it's got X's it's got an X squ there it doesn't look like that so if it doesn't look exactly the same you're going to do what sub let's do a substitution uh what's the appropriate thing to substitute for here good yeah it's usually the inside of something the derivative is always in the integral you don't want to pick the whole thing because then you're going to get a trig function that's not in there again so that would be a problem so typically try the small stuff first like X squ in this case so if we substitute for x^2 of course du = 2x DX du over 2x = DX well then we have an X still here depending on how you substitute see U du over 2x is it going to work out for us yeah X's are gone it's fantastic tell me what else we do 12 in Fr yeah 12 see U du you look what our substitution did what it did was it matched this up with something that we just learned how to do you don't have to reinvent the wheel all the time that be ridiculous so as soon as you do your substitution now you start looking at your your table of integration you go oh well how much is that do you know how much that is you know what the integral of that is think I'm covering it up it's right here so we still have the 1/2 we've got Ln we've got absolute value sure see U plus tangent U plus C the reason why they use the U here is because you are probably going to use the use here that's a lot of use do use understand me joking uh anyway the last thing that you want to do though please please don't forget to substitute back in a lot of people when are doing this they either do us they go I'm done that was so hard oh finally done or they just put X's right off the bat you don't want to do that either okay so what goes here here and here yeah so our answer is going to be 12 Ln absolute value X2 + tangent X2 + C you guys are right with that one can you put that one2 of an exponent as well you can not such a big deal I don't really care about that it is it is an exponent it would be the square root over all this stuff all right uh not super necessary for you to do that good question though any other question questions before we go on you ready for one more does anybody else need this okay cool okay this one's going to bend your brain a little bit you going have to think about this one that's another wait a minute uh that hey that definitely doesn't look anything like anything in our integration table right away right so we're going to have to do a substitution let's check out the appropriate substitution should it be 2x no if I do that it's not going to get rid of any of this stuff should it be the numerator at all no because if I do this it's not going to touch this down here so probably it's going to be something down here now let's talk about the denominator if I pick the entire denominator let's try the derivative of that what's the derivative of one well that's fantastic so when we have that get rid of that one for sure can you do the derivative of s squared oh come on what rule is that rule it's a chain rule that's right do you remember that sin^2 X means sin x all of it squared we'll bring down the two we we leave the inside alone we'll multiply by the derivative of the inside are you with me yeah we'll bring down the two we'll leave the inside alone we'll subtract one from it and we'll multiply by the derivative of the inside I want to know if you're okay with 2 sinx cosine X do you not so much derivative of sin x^ 2 that's what this means you have to know that part okay if we do the Dera of this this is 2 sin x to the first Power time the derivative of sin x what's the D of sin x two this is meaningless X that's our appropriate derivative yes no I know I went fast on that but that's old stuff are we okay with it yeah okay now wait a second does that even help us no explain why well because s of 2x the trick identity for that is 2 X I love those identities don't you love those identities this identity right here this is two SX cosine X that's the identity it's double angle you got to know those identities if not you got to got to refresh your memory like now okay go home and start you guys like tattoos right just joking you have a lot of tattoos let's see what happens here okay I forgot the DX sorry see what happens um let's do the easy for what's this become mhm if this is you know what I'm going to do this in two steps I'm sorry I'll do it in two steps the first step that I've done here it's just the identity I've just changed this into this um if you don't know that identity by heart you can look it up later it is a true identity okay so this is true at this point I would do my substitution now check out what happens I have a 2 sinx cosin x DX that's exactly this piece so this is going to change into my du so I get du over U one over U du or du over U it's the same thing okay I don't want to have I don't want to go too fast on that one I need to make sure that you guys are with me uh do you are you comfortable with this identity now that I told you that it's true are you okay with picking this as your U if you are then the derivative is 2 sin x cosine X that's literally exactly what we have here so this piece becomes du this piece becomes U and that's a really really easy integral how much is that integral abute yep we got one more thing to do we're going to put the U so Final Answer Ln absolute value 1 + s^ 2 X plus C it's actually technically not the final answer we're going to do one more thing with this one more thing I want to make sure you're okay with this so far though are you the last thing we're going to do is we're going to drop the absolute value do you know why because it can never be negative that's right it can't ever be negative this is always positive if you add one to something that's always positive it's always positive so the absolute values are kind of redundant you can do that if you know your argument's always positive so we could write this instead as just Ln this stuff plus C and that's probably how you'll see it we good that's it that's 6.1 we're done so we just started off our Ln uh we know how to take derivatives and integrals do I have any questions whatsoever how many people feel okay with with the idea you guys have questions now so now you know how to do derivatives with Ln yes just do one over inside times derivative inside integrals a little bit more labor intensive you have to do some substitutions especially with trig stuff you're going to get a lot of trig stuff in this class get you used to it learn those identities and learn how to use them okay so right now what we're going to start we're going to start section 6.2 [Applause] 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 6.2:  Derivatives of Inverse Functions
[Music] in section 6.2 we're going to learn about inverse functions the first part of this is really just review getting some properties of inverse functions uh how they look what their behaviors are then we're going start taking derivatives of inverse functions it's really not a hard section I think you guys will will be okay with it uh but we do need to know learn some things about it firstly what is it take for a function to have an inverse X and A Y it's got to have an X and A Y right but it's got to be in a relationship it's very specific one to one that's right it's got to be one have you ever heard that term one: one before one: one means that in a function every input has one unique output that means if you plug in in a number and you get out two you get out two once you never get out again um in other words I can show this with the horizontal line test you ever familiar with the horizontal line test one of these functions is one to one one of them is not which one's one to one left or right that's one: one this is not out the horizontal line test passes here it fails here this says that you have multiple outputs of the same value that would fail being one: one that matters for inverses because an inverse is you switch X and Y if you switch X and Y inputs become outputs outputs become inputs let me explain why that's important if you have a non one to1 function here and you try to find an inverse it's going to go like this it's not even going to be a function anymore and that's a problem so what we say is that for a one:1 function we can find an inverse for for a one: one function f ofx it's absolutely true that if functions 1: one it will have an inverse so if a for a one: one function f ofx an inverse it's denoted F you've seen this before I'm sure F iners it's not F to the little negative one okay it's not how we say that uh it's not an exponent at all it's probably the worst notation all the mathematics I don't know why they have the negative one there it does look like an exponent but it's not one it's pronounced F inverse of X so for a one: one function f ofx an inverse F inverse of X can be [Music] found little side note here this is how you check whether two functions are inverses it's just a little simple composition I if you do a composition of f inverse on F or F on F inverse what an inverse does is it undoes a function and a function undoes its inverse I always say it's like a any you guys have kids nobody oh you do okay so it's like a little rotten kid all right so they're not rotten though are they okay good well if I have kids they're probably going to be rotten kids so it's like if you went around around cleaning your house and the kid right behind you and no no and put everything right back to where it went so they have their toys all messy you pick up toy they go and they put it right back okay that's what inverses do they undo everything that you just did so if I plug in X into my inverse it's going to do something f is going to clean it up put it right back where it was or vice versa F would do something and inverse puts it right back where it was what that means is that whatever I plug in it's going to go through the machine through the anti- machine and give you back exactly what you plugged in that means that if you compose two functions that are inverses your result will be X and that's either way that you go here and that's how you check let me give you an example on how you find inverses then we'll check it with the composition to show that I'm I'm right here that give you the right thing and then we'll talk about the graphs and we'll probably end it right there so let's find an inverse first thing I want to tell you it is one: one uh next thing let's find an inverse here's how you do that ultimately our goal on inverses is to switch the X and the y That's What inverses do to do that we have to have a y so typically what people will do is they'll change whatever the function name is into y so instead of f ofx we're going to have y equals your function next thing here's the place where you actually make the inverse everywhere you see a y you put an X everywhere you see an X you put a y you just change the variables here so what's that going to become mhm and what's this going to look like one over very good root 2 Yus yep that's right you okay with that so far the idea now is you have to solve for what just solve for what uh give me some ideas on how to solve for y the denominator with X sure we can just switch those the square root three cool we can do that let's 2 y - 3 = 1x^2 absolutely all right then what did you say add three cool we can do that so 2 y if we add three is this yeah if my math is right did you guys get the same thing just for funsies let's make this one fraction so if we made it one fraction 1 + 3 mhm 1 over we'd have to find a common denominator that would give us 3x^2 2x^2 so we'd have 1 + 3x^2 over 2x^2 you guys okay with that one at this point you found your inverse just call it the inverse so so the notation we use if we start with f we're going to have F inverse if we start with G we're going to have G inverse all you do is you put whatever the function name is the inverse notation and then rewrite it quick head now if you're okay with with that one it's really not calculus we're just doing some inverse uh because we're going to be doing some calcul calculus inverse later what I do want to show you is that if you do compose F inverse with f ofx and this is either way you want to go you can do F inverse here f ofx it doesn't matter you're going to X in either case here's what this would say it says what I want you to do I want you to take this function I want you put it everywhere you see X here and see what you get that be the easiest one oh man either way it's going to suck that would be our comp composition are you guys okay with the composition you see where everything's coming from we're taking FX FX we're putting it into our inverse function and we're checking to see that we've done all our work right we're checking to make sure that these are actually inverses do you see what I'm talking about so we'd have one sure plus three no problem this x becomes that function that's what we got this x becomes that function and that's what we got so if we continue with this I'm going have to move over here tell me what the squares do I know it's fast but I wanted to prove it really quick because we're on of time we just proved that those things are actually inverses just do a little bit of algebra it says anytime you compose two functions and you actually get x out of it then you know their inverses uh could you follow that one yeah did I get you fast with that one a little bit do you have questions on it we have about 10 seconds so pretty much just to prove yourself you plug in whatever yeah you you compose them and if your answer is X you know the inverses all right so we're right at the beginning of start of talking about inverses I remember last time that we actually found the inverse of one function the idea behind our inverse is is basically this uh for every one: one function you can find an inverse which is also one: one uh we'll talk about a couple properties right now of inverses I'll give you some examples on how to use this as far as calculus goes then we'll start talking about another topic so a few notes on the relationship between a function and its Inverse First thing anytime you have a function which has an inverse you can always identify the graph pretty easily if you have one or the other so for instance if I have a function let's call that F firstly is that function uh one: one y yeah all right so if it's one to one it has to have an inverse here's the relationship between a function and its inverse on a graph namely a function and its inverse graphically are just a reflection across the line Y X so if this is my function well the inverse because an inverse is found simply by switching the X and the Y coordinates a it's horrible well hopefully you get the idea I'm not the best artist in the world but do you get the idea that I'm trying to show you here it's just a reflection across the line Y X if this is a one:1 function this also has to be a one to one fun function if it's if this was not one: one this would not even be a function that would be a problem so if F feel okay with the idea of the graphs so a function and its inverse are just Reflections across the line yal X second secondly if f is continuous on a certain domain then F inverse will be continuous on a certain domain just keep this in mind the domain of F becomes the range range of f inverse so what I'm going to State this and I'll try to explain a little bit better for you the wording is a little bit weird but here I'll say it this way if f is continuous on a certain domain this doesn't mean continuous everywhere this means that where it's continuous I'll explain the rest of a minute where it's continuous so if f is continuous on a certain domain F inverse will also be continuous on a certain domain however I'll put this in parenthesis here the domain of f inverse is the range of f so so for instance let's say f is continuous somewhere okay it's continuous on its on a certain domain which means it's continuous on its range as well so where a function is continuous it just doesn't have any holes or gaps so what this say is that if f is continuous from X = 3 to X = pos2 well it's also continuous on the range from let's say this is like -2 -2 to pos5 that means F inverse will be continuous from what I say -2 -2 to POS 5 along the x-axis the range of f becomes the domain of f inverse so you could think about it this way if f is continuous along a certain range F inverse will be continuous along that certain domain okie dokie so continuity it doesn't try not think about about just a domain or range issue continuity just means it's continuous as in it has no jumps gaps holes ASM tootes or anything like thata right so what we're trying to say here is that where f is continuous on its range F inverse is continuous on that particular domain it's it stayed a little bit funny so if f is continuous on a certain domain F inverse will be also be continuous on a certain domain but this is the range of f here example small example because I can tell by looking your eyes so you're like what what you talking about here we go uh easy example let's say that here is our here's our function here's our function if this is the function f first Le is it one to one yeah it's got to have an inverse how you find inverses is you just reverse X and Y so if this is at -2 comma 7 we're going to also have a point on the inverse from where at what where cool and if we have a point at -3 1 where's our point on the to be okay my graphs are not to scale but let's make the points bigger and hopefully you get the idea so this just flip-flops right across the y x line well here's the deal what we'd say here is this is continuous along the x-axis from3 to -2 and continuous along the range so that's our domain and continuous along the range from 1 to 7 well that means here it's continuous along the domain of 1 to 7 and along the range from3 to -2 does that make sense you guys see how the range in the domain switches so don't get all hung up on the continuity basis says if this is continuous that's continuous that's the idea anyway also in the last thing thing we'll work most with right now if f is differentiable which means we can find a derivative at any point along the domain for which it's defined if f is differentiable f inverse is also differentiable question can you real quick just Mark where those points are at on the graph like with the box like number comma number so I can make it better on my notes cuz I I'll forget it go for it3 1 -273 okay do the same thing there that's 31 uh 13 7 -2 so a couple things that we know about the properties here a function and its inverse have relationship graphically of just a reflection across the line Y X are you guys okay with that one okay secondly basically basically if this is continuous this is continuous that's the idea if this is not continuous this is not continuous at some point that's the idea okay the range of f becomes the domain of f inverse that's another idea also if f is differentiable means we can find a derivative then F inverse is differentiable and here's actually how you do it if I want to find the derivative of an inverse function here's one way we can do this uh now if you're wondering why don't we just find the inverse and take the derivative of that sometimes it's not that easy to find an inverse explicitly sometimes it's it's hard to do that so we have this way of working around it uh where all we need to do is find the derivative of the actual function and use that to our advantage to find the derivative of the inverse here's how we would at a certain point here's how we show it so if I want to find the derivative of an inverse I can do it two ways I can find the derivative of the function first which would sorry the U the inverse of the function first then go for the derivative or I can do this I can find the derivative of the actual function compose F inverse into it which if you don't know how to find that explicitly you can't do that uh for every point but you can do it for certain number of Point like for like a a given point uh and I'll show you that example in just a minute so we can actually work around finding the derivative of the actual inverse itself um let me give you a couple examples on how we can how we can evaluate inverses at certain points uh given a function let me give you another piece of notation here too some books to do this some books say well you know what let's suppose g ofx equals F inverse then they do this they say G Prime of X those of you who like the prime notation like this G Prime of X would then equal 1/ fime with G of X composed into it that's the idea do you guys see that the notation is the saying the same thing here did you guys see that here's derivative of the inverse here's derivative of the inverse remember that's the inverse here the derivative is one over one over the derivative of f no problem with the inverse composed in it with the inverse composed on to it should H feel okay with with that would you like a couple examples CU right now it's pretty vague yeah okay let's start here just some Basics on how we can go about U evaluating the inverse at a certain point without actually finding the inverse I'll say that again how we can go about evaluating the inverse at a point without actually finding the inverse please pay attention here because the next part of this uh using derivatives is going to be based on this idea okay very similar to this idea so quick example some of your homework questions are worded just like this so let's suppose we have a function x cubus one and what our homework or what our test or whatever you're trying to do this how it's worded what I want to do is find find F inverse of a when aal1 like f inverse of a when aal1 I'm going to give you some steps on how to do this it's not a hard concept for the most part uh but here just just think of this for a second we're going to use one byond conditional statement that's absolute truth for inverses to make this thing work in our advantage here's the the statement we're going we're going to talk about F ofx equal a if and only if F inverse of a equals what do you know not negative one no x x that's right look look if I plug X into our function it gives me a then I should plug in a into my inverse and it'll give me back X remember inverses undo functions does that make sense to you so this would have to equal x so if and only if if and only if that well then here's what we're going to do step one set F ofx equal to Whatever A You are given check this out if we set F ofx equal to whatever a were given if I can find out what x is I know what F inverse of a is so set this equal to whatever a you're given what's our function in this case good let's set that inut to whatever a I'm given how much is the a so here on this step we do X - 1 = 1 you okay with that by the way this is a really simplistic example you'll see that in a second but I just want to get you into the pattern of this next solve for x how would I solve this for X plus one okay so we'd add one and then what's our answer going to be so if I solve this for X sure add one we're going to get X Cub = 0 or x = 0 step number three man we're just going to State what the inverse evaluated to a is so find F inverse at a so here's the deal you guys believe this yes this definition for for inverses basically says okay well if f ofx equals a then F inverse of a equals X switch to the X and the y That's How inverses work so it's going to undo whatever operation whatever function you have okay well we're going to use this say okay if F ofx = A then in this case X - 1 = 1 if we solve that for X check this out if we solve that for X this is the X we're talking about so when we set our function equal to a and we solve it for X we're basically saying okay well if this works in terms of a function then if I take X inverse of what's my a again I me then F inverse of1 has to equal the x that I just solved for equals that's what we're trying to find that's the idea let kind of working backwards we set our function equal to a we solve for x that X is the answer that you're looking for in this case does that make sense to you it's a little backwards work it's a little weird uh let's try it one more time and then we'll uh we'll move on this one to take a little bit more thinking so I want you to really focus on this uh I know some of you don't really like trigonometry all that much but we're going to deal with it right now here's our function so here's our function I want us to find find F inverse of a so same question when a equals what do I want uh one okay why don't you guys tell me what's the first step what would I what would I start by doing a very good so let's do that if we set F ofx equal to a and we solve for x that's our answer we can just solve for x so on our first step we're going to have what equal to what please very good notice what I'm not doing I'm not taking this and plug it in in that's not the idea I want to find out when a is plugged into F inverse what do we get so I'm not plugging this number in here I'm setting this equal to a so 3 piun x + sin x x = 1 now I'm giving you this example to show you that it's not always very simple algebra to solve this this was really simple algebra sometimes you actually really have to think about what's going on here so there's no algebraic way to solve that we're going to have to just think about what we can plug in to make this true what what do we put here to make that true start thinking I'll give you a second so think about it for a second see if you can find something remember it's got to be the same thing in both spots so same thing in both spots think of the angles that you know sign for I wouldn't be thinking of like 1/2 because you can't plug in 1/2 I'll be thinking like pi over something for two reasons firstly I got to get rid of a pi here does that make sense got to get rid of Pi otherwise I'm not going to get a one so a pi over something here and a pi over something here and see what you can get so that when you add it together it's going to give you one think for a minute [Applause] if you can't think of one off the top of your head start trying some start trying things like pi over two or pi over 3 or pi over 4 or pi over 6 start thinking of them let's try pi over 2 if I try pi over 2 what's sign of pi/ 2 one one p two here would pies would be gone I'd have 3+ 1 is 3+ 1 equal to 1 no no okay so Pi 2 doesn't work try things like pi over 3 all right so pi over 3 what's s of pi over 3 3un 3 over2 well there's no way that I'm going to have a root3 over2 and something doesn't have a square root in it and get a one so that can't be right pi over 4 also has aun2 over two right so that's not going to work how about pi over what do you think pi over six might work let's try that so if I do pi over 6 so this would be step number two showing our work here how much is s of Pi 6 what happens here that's kind of cool right we got eyes are gone one does it work okay so here's the idea we just found out the number so that when I plug it into my function it gives me one my a so how much is our x equal to in our case yeah our X in our case is pi/ 6 your H feel okay with that now let's just put it all together remember that F inverse of a equals x whatever X you just found here so what we show this as is f inverse of f inverse of what what's our a one equals that's the idea that's working with inverses okay quick show hands you feel okay with the idea of this I got to be honest with you sometimes it's really easy sometimes it's not sometimes takes a lot of thought here so but do you understand the concept of it yeah okay cool the last thing we're going to talk about in our section is how to find the derivative of an inverse evaluated at a point um I think I told you that sometimes it's really easy to find the inverse and just take the Der of it sometimes it's not so I'm going to show you a way that we can go around actually finding like without actually finding the inverse function to find a derivative evaluated at a point so here's what we're going to do we're going to start with this example we're going to find the derivative of G where gal F inverse for FX = X cub at the point 28 if you're wondering what in the world are you talking about Mr Leonard this is making no sense to me here's a plan what's a derivative mean in other words the average change that's not the average change instantaneous instantaneous change or slope of a curve at a point you ever heard that before I mean my students memorize say der is slope of curv point now set it so derivative is oh you're getting it one more time derivative is okay so what I'm looking for is the derivative of remember this is the inverse the derivative of the inverse or the slope of the inverse at that point are you guys with me on this so at this point let's let's let's just practice for a second this point is on the function on the inverse would it be 28 or 8 2 so we'd be finding the the slope of this curve inverse at 82 are you all with me on this that's the idea here that's what we're going to be doing I got some steps for you on how to do this every single time it's honestly it's not that hard step number one just verify that this point is actually on that function it's very easy just plug it in so verify that Point's actually on the function so step number one F of what would you plug in would you plug in you plug in plug in two make sure it gives you eight so F of 2 gives you 2 Cub gives you8 that's step number one just verify that the point is on the curve because we want to make sure that we're we're talking about for inverse the same scenario here on the inverse so 82 rather than 28 you guys okay with that so far all right number two number two is kind of a two-part thing I want us to find the derivative of the function so find frime of X and find G of whatever your y coordinate is because when I find my inverse they're going to switch so find G of 8 let's start with the um with the derivative firstly what's the derivative of f what are we going to get perfect how about G of 8 keep this in mind I know we're using G but G really stands for the inverse if F ofx has a 28 in it tell me something about the inverse what happens if I take the inverse are you guys okay that that's actually the inverse here yes no since this says inverse if I say hey plug in8 what what's that have to give me yeah the point says it okay the point says when you plug in two you're two to the function you're going to get out eight therefore the inverse says when I plug in eight I'm going to get out two I don't even care that you have a formula this says it for you so that's got to give you two show hands you feel okay with with that one okay now here's the cool part if we know that all we got to do is use that formula I just gave you so our formula said G Prime of X gives you 1 F inverse sorry fime evaluated at G of X here's what we're going to do we're not trying to find G Prime of X in terms of X we're trying to find it at an actual point so we're trying to look for G Prime of 8 G Prime of 8 says this it says you take one over the derivative of f evaluated at G of 8 now how much is G of 8 so we're going to find check this out please watch we're going to have frime of what how much is G of 8 two all you got to do is take that two plug it in here and figure it out one over 3 * 2^ 2 how much is that going to give us 1 over 3 3 * t^2 yes no or did I lose you I don't want to lose you but I want to make sure that you're you're okay on this we're going to do one more example on how to do this but I want to make sure that you guys are good to go so the idea is this G is going to stand for your inverse if I want to find the derivative of g at a certain point here's the way that we can go about it we don't actually have to find the inverse function of G to do it what we can do is all right well cool uh first let's make sure that 28 is actually in the function it is if 28 is in the function 82 is in the inverse function now you happy you understand that okay all right well then that's all this is saying is that 82 is in the inverse function all right cool well let's find the derivative of f very easy to do for us CU we're in calculus 2 and then here's how we can find it if you want G Prime of whatever point I'm talking about G Prime of 8 take one over the derivative evaluated at that number whatever that is so just take the derivative plug this into it and that's our that's the slope of this curve the inverse curve at the point 82 show P feel all right with that one okay it's a little weird right we're kind of going like the back door approach here we're not going directly at it we're going around it can we do one more example see if you really hang on to it yeah maybe you can try some of this so same idea I want to find the derivative of g at a point for this function so same start here let's just do it when f ofx is x^2 + 1 Cub at the8 okay quickly first we're supposed to do is what please ver let's verify it yeah plug in the one make sure it gives you eight for the function itself doesn't I don't think it does you plug in one pluged in one no oh yeah sorry get two did it work okay so if I plug in one you get eight you're good okay listen you can do the second step right now at least part of it do the Second Step second step is a two-parter uh what's name one thing you're going to do in the Second Step you have to find the derivative because that's what we're using here so find the derivative Also let's let's do this together right now okay I'll have you do the derivative in just a second but check this out I know I'm about to find the derivative but tell me this how much is G how much is G of 8 if you know F of one gives you 8 how much is G of 8 how much is that one perfect tell you what when you get down to this step right here after you find the derivative what number are you going to be plugging in one it's the same thing you found right there just plug in one so I want you to find the derivative right now of f what do we need for that derivative what are you going to use love the chain R hopefully you got that did you get that yes yeah okay cool you guys are practically done now we're going to use the formula that I gave you the formula says if you want to find G Prime at whatever this point is if you want to find G Prime of 8 what we're going to do is put 1 over fime of G of 8 that's the idea 1 over F Prime um how much was we we already talked about this how much was G of8 again so really all it says is okay okay make sure this works firstly find the derivative plug in that number plug in that number to your derivative put it over one put it under one and you're basically done have you guys plugged in one to this you guys see where to plug in the one we plug in one right here how much did it give you 24 24 so we' say G Prime of 8 = 1 24 here's what it says provided that you are actually able to find the inverse of this if you were to find the inverse take a derivative and plug in the number eight it's going to give you 1 24 it's finding the slope of your inverse at 81 that's what it's doing it's kind of cool right show if feel okay with that one that's it that's really all we're going to go for as far as inverses you guys have any questions at all about about this so far can you find an inverse if I give it to you can I find an inverse if I give you a function okay can you do examples like this one where they're pretty basic yeah this one you have to think about it's a little bit harder can you are you guys okay with these two cool question um so for that one where we just have to think about it will we ever be able to isolate that X and later on so it's always yeah you can't not here at least you can't get that explicitly defined you can't solve it for X it's all unit circle pretty much right yeah this one's a thinker because you have an algebra concept and you have a trigonometric concept you use inverse here but you're going to be stuck with an ex good questions all right we're going to move on the next thing we're going to talk about because we've already talked about natural log function it really seems logical that we're going to talk about exponential functions next because exponentials and logarithmic functions are hand in hand they're inverses of each other hey that's what we talked about inverses so we did logarithmic okay we did inverses now we can talk about exponentials because inverses sorry exponentials and logarithms are invers of one 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 6.3:  Derivatives and Integrals of Exponential Functions
so let's do it 6.3 we're going to talk about some exponential functions in order to do that I've got to define a number for you uh we're going to Define what the base of a natural logarithm is I think you've probably seen this before E you ever heard of the the number e before number e is awesome number uh this guy guy way back in uh the old days name was Leonard Oiler I know awesome name uh discovered this number it's an irrational number goes forever very much like Pi 2.7 blah blah blah blah blah BL forever never and never it's not rational occurs so much that this guy said you know what this is crazy this number is found in nature all the time we use it for engineering all the time uh this number e we're going to call it the Oiler number cuz in in German Oiler is not spelled o i l e r it's spelled e u l e r so the E comes from Oiler but spelled different than than we usually spell it so anyway it's called the oiler number or the natural number and how we Define it e is defined as this it's a number that when I say Ln of this number it gives me one so give you another definition too it's kind of a more mathematical one says hey you know what if I had uh do you remember this yeah that was true because we developed that basically in the kind of the first day of class we we did that we said l x is equal to the integral from 1 to X of 1 T DT well what that implies is that if x now becomes e Ln X well Ln e 1 to X well one to e this has to equal one sorry forgot my equals if l equals 1 that's our definition here folks that means that this integral also has to equal one the do you guys remember that the integral is the area under a curve between two points that's what a different integral is so what this says is the area under this curve is one another way we can find it by the way if you're curious as to whether this number actually exists by the intermediate value theorem it has to exist um by the IBT because so a little bit of a side note here because natural log function is continuous everywhere if I could spell it right and the range and the range is negative Infinity to to POS Infinity what the intive value theem says is this if a function is continuous along its range then for any number along the range you can find an input that that verifies that output so basically it says because natural log looks like this the range goes from negative Infinity to positive Infinity do you remember this this graph here is a that one because it goes from negative Infinity to positive Infinity that means that any output that I choose has to have some sort of an input that's what intermediate value theorem says well because natural log is continuous everywhere and because the range is negative Infinity to Infinity that means that there has to be some input that when I plug it in it gives me one there has to be does that make sense to you there's got to be it goes from negative Infinity to Infinity every single point is continuous it's continuous there's no holes or gaps that means that I've got to be able to plug something in to get a one we call that number e that's how it's defined does that make sense to you okay so the the number e has to exist it's got to be part of the function um last definition that we got for this so we Define it if Ln of y = x we have that if and only if e to xal Y that's how we go back and forth doing exponentials and logi notation if you don't remember that what's the base of Ln says base to the power gives you the argument of log that's what we have right here now what's kind of cool about this is we got a couple properties that are going to help us solve equations that have e or Ln in them so I'm going to go over those properties with you right here we're going do a few examples so first property first one is kind of so nice the first one is this if you have Ln of e to X so Ln of e to X do you know what the answer is going to be okay you could you can move the the X in front of the Ln do you remember doing that yeah okay but this is also cool how much is Ln of e that was our definition so what this is equal to is X the reason why is you want the proof here's the proof right next to it if you bring this down we have X Ln e how much l of one equals x there's the proof for that number two the other one if we have e to the Ln X do you know how much that's equal to it's equal to X it's also equal to X for a very similar reason so this also equals x I can actually prove it to you if you really want me two here's the proof uh if you have e to the Ln xal X check it out if you didn't know that these were equal we can prove that equal by getting down to the same thing on both sides so take Ln of both sides if you do we would get Ln e to Ln xal Ln X are you guys with me on that taking Ln on both sides what can I do with this so Ln x * Ln e = Ln don't even bother uh what do we have here this is equal to one it proves that those two sides are equal therefore these two sides are equal therefore this is a true statement are you guys okay with those ones practically it's this whenever you have e next to Ln here or here you can say they cancel each other they eliminate each other in other words we're going to get whatever the argument is whatever X is that's going to be our answer show hands field with those ones what this allows you to do is solve some exponential or logarithmic equations really nicely we're going to practice just a few of them right now and talk about how this stuff works for us so we take a little break from calculus I suppose we're start just do some algebra to make sure you guys are good with this stuff okay so it's an equation we should be able to solve it in this class so we got e 4 - 5x = 9 we go oh my gosh how in the world are we going to solve that thing what do you think yeah we can do anything we want to on both sides as long as we do it to both sides of our equation we can take both sides to and make it a power of E we can take both sides and put Ln in front of it as long as you do to both sides what I can't have you do is do Ln here and forget to do Ln here that's kind of a rookie mistake that a lot of people make but don't forget that you can actually take Ln of both sides so if we do that we do Ln of e 4 - 5x we do Ln of 9 someone out there explain to me why in the world we just did that we do have to do to both sides but why did we bother with Ln good very good um you can do this one of two ways you can bring the exponent down if you want to you can just understand that because of this property this is proved right if something's proved you get to use it so this says that our answer is going to be this argument this exponent right here so yeah you can bring it down make sure it's in parenthesis okay don't forget those freaking parenthesis you can bring it down you oh that's one multiply by one you get 4 - 5x or in other words look here look here this is 4 - 5x it's magic no that's not magic we proved it right it's it has to work proved it equals ln9 don't forget about the L on the right hand side quick head down if you're okay with that one we're moving kind of quick here because this is algebra I just want to refresh your memories now what do we Dove yeah just solve it so we're going to take cool subtract four but yeah you're close so I'm going to put that up front because we're going change signs here so -4 + Ln 9 last step what's the last step everybody when you're yeah if we divide by5 we get X = pos4 fsus Ln of 9 over 5 are you guys okay with the algebra on that one yeah so it allows us to solve some things really really nicely that we otherwise wouldn't have been able to do tell you what we'll try I don't know three four more together and then we'll call this Good okay let's go kind of almost row by Row first two rows what would you do first on this step would you do Ln on both sides right now good idea bad idea what would you do first yeah in order for us to do Ln on both sides we have to have the E isolated okay so this two not so bleno we're going to get rid of that thing we're going to have e 5x - 1 = 23 well that's a little bit better because now we can actually take an Ln on both sides that's our next step so whenever we get caught and we have wow we have some number raised to a power when we can't find common bases take an Ln on both sides match up Ln with e we'll be able to simplify that you just got to make sure that you don't neglect it on the right hand side okay uh middle people what are we going to have on the left hand side perfect these are gone if you if you're the type of person who has to cross stuff out fine cross it out I don't care you just need to know that our answer on the left or our answer the expression left hand side is 5x - one okay other middle people you guys what's the next step for sure so if we add one one quick thing this is a little bit ambiguous as to what you're doing use parenthesis appropriately here right now don't add one to 2/3 please don't do that use parentheses that way I know you understand that it's l of 2/3 and then after that you're going to be adding one is that clear and then lastly we'll divide by five you can separate into fractions if you really want to or you leave it's just like that still so far so good yeah it's all right okay how about this one one [Applause] more is this one of the ones where we want to take Ln on both sides no no that's silly so we got what undoes Ln sure so what do we do make each side an exponent of e so take e on both sides that's fine I don't care so e Ln 7x -1 equals do we have to do on the right hand side it's an equation okay left hand side what happens e to the Ln of whatever I have is that's this one whenever I have this our expression changes just to whatever the exponent is so in our case these are gone we get 7 x -1 = e to the 9th after that man piece of K just solve for x how are we going to solve for x perfect so if I add 1 we get x = e to 9th + 1 if I divide by 7 put the whole thing as 7 or you can write this as e 9th + 1 * 1 7 either way is appropriate and I really don't care show hands you feel okay with how to solve these basic ones all right we'll practice a couple more next time and we'll talk start talking about how to do derivatives of e so we're going to continue talking about how to solve these equations that involve Ln or E tox now one thing you'll notice on this equation we got Ln everywhere one good idea that you have by the way I'm going to go through these quickly because this doesn't really involve calculus I just want to give you a little Refresh on how to do some of these ones uh things that you can and can't do so whenever you involve Ln on both sides of your equation one good idea would be to combine and make one Ln on each side if you can uh once you do that what's going to get rid of Ln for us good okay so can we make one Ln on each side yeah how would I do that okay so if I have Ln plus Ln I know that I can combine those via uh multiplication as soon as you have that you have one Lon on one side and anything else on the other side basically as long as you have all your variables on one side and something else on the other side take e put e on both sides and treat these as exponents of e once we do that you guys already told me that you can by the way when I do the E thing do I do it to one side or both sides both Sid yeah it is an equation you have to do it to both sides in this case that's actually really nice because I had Ln on both sides that means that when I do e on both sides everything's going to be gone except for my x's and my constants so on the left hand side tell me what happens when I have e next to Ln pretty much in any scenario what happens okay what am I going to have left on the left hand side perfect right hand side two fantastic can we keep going this becomes a pretty easy pretty straightforward at least algebra problem let's go ahead and solve for x we will do what anytime you see an X squar you're going to well you're going to try to factor it uh somehow if you can't Factor it what would you use sure so there's really three ways right there's there's factoring which is the quickest if you know how to factor really well then there's completing the square we we rarely do that really because we can go straight to quadratic formula so here we'd have x^2 - x we'd subtract the two can you factor that one as I've been rambling hopefully you've been factoring yeah minus two which means that if we have this we set each of these equal to zero by the zero product property and we get x = pos2 and x = -1 quick show has be okay with both our Solutions are you sure yeah you sure you're sure you better look back at your problem here real quick folks because we need we need to know something about the domain of the natural log function X has to be bigger than zero that's right X has to be positive so are both of these valid Solutions no no which one's wrong so we actually only have one real solution here whenever you find your answers for for Ln please please check them make sure you go back to your original not here not uh not here but here your original plug it in make sure that you don't have anything that falls outside the domain otherwise we have an issue there quick head on if you're okay with that one okay uh let's do one more switch up a little bit we'll try something like this you know you've had something similar to this in probably your pre-calculus class or maybe an advanced algebra or whatever whenever we have a scenario where we have a trinomial what's really nice is if we can fit this into some sort of a um a quadratic we want to try to fit this into a quadratic can you fit this into a quadratic form here's how you know you look at your middle term you look at your first term if you can take the variable part of your middle term and the same as sorry if this is the the same as your middle term squared then you can make a substitution and make it a quadratic for instance if I were to rewrite this I say well wait a minute let's look here and here can I write this as e to X squar is that the same thing yeah this is not the same as this or this is the same as this same same it's not okay do you remember your exponent rules it okay let's practice next next rules s or 12 let's all try this and get it right this time 7 or 12 oh dear lord how about this one seven or 12 seven oh thank God okay seven okay good is this the same yes yes because you multiply what's x * 2 x * 2 is 2x are you clear on this one are you sure okay I'm glad we went over this huh wow goodness minus5 let's keep this in parenthesis here real quick here's what you try to do if you don't know immediately how to solve this problem cuz I'm guessing you you look at that and go um uh I don't know well if it's got three terms in it maybe try to make it into a quadratic what I saw right off the bat is that this is this part squared do you see what I'm talking about this is this part squared if that's the case notice how we have exact the same thing here and here are you guys with me on that exactly the same thing whenever you have that one part's being squared one part's not being squ s you can use a substitution just create a dummy variable like y if you do a substitution like y = edx then instead of writing edx everywhere what could we write everywhere because I asked you just joking some people got this stand up next time you'll get it whatever it was funny you missed it I'm not going to edit that out watch it again and you'll laugh I promise so so instead of e x we got well we got y^2 - 5 y + 6 = do you see why that helps us why does that help us because it's easy say what now why does it help us quadratic you can actually Factor yeah you can Factor Quadra whatever you want so this allows us to actually do some things with it where this one didn't so once you get down to here Matt this should be a piece of cake can you guys Factor this x MH Ian yeah be careful with these ones a lot of people do is FES and ones or sixes and ones you we have to have the correct numbers here this is3 -2 so y - 3 y - 2 we okay with that one that means that y = 3 and Y = 2 y = 3 and Y = 2 and are we going to stop right there well let's look back are variable was in terms of X at the very beginning what's the variable we ended with that's not a good thing so can we get back to X's well this is like your trail of breadcrumbs this told you what you did right so if we made a substitution y for E DX now we're going to reverse that we're going to do a substitution edx for our y are you guys okay with that so far I know it's just algebra but I want to make sure you guys are good at this so instead of yal 3 what can I write please and instead of Y = 2 I could have e to x = 2 that's excellent now oh my goodness can you solve that if e to the x equals 2 Can You Solve IT how would you solve it yeah which which particular type of log the natural log that's right the natural log guess we want to match up our our bases so if we take a natural log on both sides like this Ln e x = Ln 2 do you guys remember we went over it yesterday um remember what happens anytime you have Ln next to an E we could move this forward Ln of e is is one so what's on the left hand side of our equation on the right hand side that's actually one of our Solutions so X is ln3 natural log 3 over here same thing happens we get xals that's it I want to Quick show hands if you feel okay with that algebra you sure are there any questions at all so our ideas are once again if you have multiple LNS try to try to combine them because that way when we do e on both sides it actually works out okay otherwise it's not going to work out also whenever we have some things that have potential be quadratics try substitution try to work with some of the algebra techniques that you've already learned that'll often times make it easier are we okay with uh with these two okay before we get on to the calculus involving uh exponential e to the X we got to talk about a few properties so make a few notes here these are going to be important we're going to use these a lot it's it's going to be help for us helpful for us to have a good picture of what the function adx actually looks like then these properties are going to make a lot more sense to you do you guys have a good picture of what edx looks like in your head do you know what it looks like no does it go it does it look like Ln is it a straight line okay let's start easy if you plug in zero how much is it going to give you you plug in zero e to the 0 is good so we're going to cross for sure at 01 notice how he's about the number 2.7 all right so if we plug in bigger numbers if we plug in like one I'm going to get up 2.7 if I plug in two that's going to be 2.7 squar plug in three 2.7 to the thir power and so on and so on is it going to climb or fall climb and climb fast it's an exponential exponentials climb fast over here negatives if I plug in negative 1 am I going to get a negative number no no if I plug in any negative am I going to get a negative number so this thing is going to be above the xaxis all the time can you verify that for me it will never cross the xaxis because it never actually equals zero so what this thing looks like it does cross at 01 it climbs over here it's asmic to the xais as we go to negative numbers have you seen that before yeah it's that function it climbs the whole time we okay with that one well if we got a picture of this you guys see y by the way if we put if we plug in negatives such as e to the -2 really that's just 1/ e^2 it's not negative it's just a really small number and it gets smaller the more negative number we put in there if we got the picture these ones make a lot of sense firstly let's talk about the domain and the range domain the domain is well the inputs or the outputs you guys should know that good and well what is that is it the inputs or the outputs domain always has to do with the inputs so what can you plug into edx is there any restriction on it whatsoever no then you're correct about the domain domain is negative Infinity to Infinity it says that you can plug in anything along the x-axis you're good to go you're always going to find an output for that make sense okay how about the the range is the range negative Infinity to Infinity what do we get out of this thing Z to do we actually get out zero no okay so how can I show that with my range uhhuh do you remember doing the interval notation when yeah we we don't get out any negatives firstly verify that for me can you see that we don't get out any negatives so that's not in a Range we don't get out zero but we get things that are very close to zero it's almost like that limit idea that you have we get really we approach it we never get to it so we use the parentheses to signify that how high do we go yeah can you guys see those the domain and the range on the picture does it makees sense to you all right oh yeah next up continuity where is it continuous for continuity we always use the domain idea of that we say the the X values or the input values for which this thing is continuous so what's the interval of continuity for our function is it continuous everywhere is what I'm asking you is it continuous everywhere so it's continuous on its entire domain what's also interesting let's talk about concavity does this function ever change concavity ever remember what concavity is concavity is the way the the the SHP the Curve the shape is curved that doesn't make sense the curve is shaped so it's either increasing in an increasing fashion or increasing in a decreasing fashion this happens to be concave up increasing in an increasing fashion so here we have concave up also for the entire domain which is interesting it's always holding water I think that you learned that in calculus one if it can hold water then it's concave up if it's an umbrella then it's concave down well this thing's always concave up the entire the entire curve also we talk about one more thing and we'll give you some examples here let's talk about the limit as X approaches positive infinity and the limit as X approaches negative Infinity so how much is the limit of e tox as X approaches positive Infinity do you remember what that means means as we go this way where's our function going is it going up down or level up forever and ever and ever so what's the limit of e x as X approaches positive Infinity what is it infity yeah it's going way up there it's going to Infinity how about the other way what if we go all the way to the left so as X approaches negative Infinity what is our function doing what's our function's value as X gets further and further further away negative how much what's it going to Z zero that's right I'm going to give you two more uh this really isn't in exponentials but it's going to help you because sometimes we deal with limit as far as Ln goes as well so I want to give this to you as well if you remember this I hope that you do the function e tox and the function Ln X are inverses do you remember that so Ln X looks like this graph I think I drew it for you earlier where looks like that you remember that that would be Ln X so e x and Ln X if I go to positive Infinity for the lnx function what's the limit as X approaches positive Infinity of l x it's still Infinity it's it's climbing slower but it's still climbing you guys okay with that one are you sure okay how about the limit should I make this limit go to negative Infinity for lnx no is that even relevant no can I plug in negatives at all to my Ln function I don't know are look at this the dotted line are there any negatives over here does the dotted graph exist over here then that would make no sense what number do I want to see this approach zero can I do this would that make sense no no it has to be from the positive side very good uh when we're talking about limits remember that for a limit to exist it must exist in both directions so if I have this is is actually inaccurate this says that this would be from both ways and that's not the case it doesn't even exist over here so we'd say from the right from the right hand side what's happening here are you guys okay with that notation this says find the limit of Ln x no problem as X approaches zero okay I know where that's at from not both sides it do even exist over here but from the right hand side so what's happening to my function Ln X as I'm going this way getting closer and closer and closer to zero What's the value of my function approaching it's not zero it's going down down down down down negative infity that's a horrible negative infity there we go would you like a couple examples on how to use this in some limits because you're going to have to do you want to see some firstly do these properties make sense now that you have a good picture of what the Ln and what the edx look like good let's do some examples and actually apply it real quick examples oops for okay let's take a look at that one so limit X approaches infity e x- 2 e 2x over my goodness that looks like a bunch of junk you know what it's really hard to think about what's going on when you have all those negative exponents floating around isn't it go wait a second this is this is e to the negative but that's negative infin so e to the that would really be Infinity well that that's Infinity already so if you think about this this would be Infinity well that's going to be zero but this is going to be Infinity over infinity can we do limits if you have Infinity over infinity does the let's see if you know uh true or false Infinity over infinity it's what no that's not true we can't do that so we got to work around this somehow and I believe in your 4A class what your teacher should have told you is that you're going to look at your denominator and you're going to divide by part of your denominator typically it's the largest exponent here because we're going to NE Infinity it's going to really suit us to get rid of this e to the -2X because what that's giving us this is giving us an Infinity here does that make sense to you that's the problem so what I want to do I want to show you a couple tricks on how you you get around these ideas one thing I'm going to do here I'm going to take this by the way you're you typically always in your this isn't really a rational function U but when you have these fractions you'll typically divide by something down here not up here you'll usually look here okay otherwise you can if you divide by the wrong thing you can get u a zero on the denominator which of course we can't have that so you typically divide by some term down here I'm going to divide everything by E to the- 2x let's see if we can do this together okay I'm still going to have a limit negative Infinity remember when we divide we're dividing every single one of these terms so let's let's do this uh how much is e to thex / e to -2X how much is e tox / e to -2X recall that when we divide common bases which have exponents this is what we're doing here folks are you guys okay with that idea what do you do with your exponents you add or subtract subract Sox minus -2X how much is that so that's e to X are you okay with the E to XX - -2X we're basically adding x + 2x minus how about this one let's do that one I'm going change this around here we have 2 e 2x over e2x remember that we're dividing each term by this so each term by this what's our answer going to be so we're still going up to two though right again what do you do when you have exponents over exponents you add or subtract 2 - -2 that's e to the how much are you okay with these I'm not getting a whole lot of participation do you see where these are coming from are you sure so 2 e to 4 okay that's cool now this one should be easy what happens when you take something and you divide it by itself how much is that I love that one this is one and lastly if we have 3 e to 2x what's going to give us okay well that makes it at least a little bit more manageable let's see what happens here um oh you know what we actually have some properties for that we have some limits we should know what that means let's think about this for a second what happens when I go e to the infinity what what is that what's the limit as X approaches negative Infinity of e tox it should be right right down there how much is that so this thing is zero how about e to oh 4X well think about this what's uh what's 4 * negative Infinity if you were allowed to plug that in what would that be still be negative Infinity okay so this is still e to the negative Infinity how much is that Z still zero are you guys okay with that one so this is still zero one how much is one one one that's nice I like that that's what we're trying to get that's why we divided so we can get this constant in there somewhere how much is oh look at this we have basically the same thing how much is e 4X again as X approaches negative Infinity it's a still 0 so practically we have 0 - 0 over 1 + 0 I messed up 0 - 0 1 + 0 that's 0 over 1 is it okay to have 0 over one would it be okay to have one over zero okay so that's why we divide by the largest power in the denominator not the numerator what's that give us zero this limit is zero if you know anything about uh limits what this basically says to you is that you for this function you are going to have a horizontal ASM toote to the left at at y equal 0 that's what that's doing so it looks practically like this show feel okay with that idea all right let's talk about one more there's not going to be a whole lot of algebraic work in this next one but I want you to think through what's going on okay so second example okay these things can really make you crazy all right they really can but stick with it follow what the properties are telling you and change little pieces uh to start with so I want to start with we're not going to do anything in this problem okay we're just going to think about it we're going to think what what each piece means let's start here don't even worry about the one over just tell me what is lnx what's the limit of Ln X as X approaches zero from the right we had that down here didn't we so we had zero from right and eight so this piece right here that little piece the Ln X is going to negative Infinity do you guys follow me what I'm talking about how much is one over remember this is negative Infinity how much is one over something that's going to negative Infinity Z going how much is um 1 over1 whatever this is really close to Z it's really close to zero yeah it's negative but it's really really close to zero does that make sense so if this is negative Infinity how much is this Z it's zero does that make sense to you I know it's negative but it's a really small negative number uh wow infinitely how would you say that really small absolute value wise it's a really small infinitely small yeah infinitesimally small so this little thing right here dead blow your mind's like mind grenade are you guys with me let's start over because I'm getting some blank looks like you're going what um so today's lesson is not that far back I'm just joking but right here do you understand that this is negative INF if you divide by posi infinity or negative Infinity what do you get either way so this part is really tending to zero are you clear okay how about e to thex where X is getting really close to zero how much is this little piece going to go to one just this just the negative X how much is that plug in zero how much do you get one one okay so e to thex this this piece is going to be one that's right because when we get really close to zero e to the 0 is one so we're going to have that if you look back at um e to X when you get close to zero when X gets close to zero how much is our function that so e x would be even still because we're doing zero we've got one there so this is going to give us one show Answer beated with that one fantastic so we know that our let's talk about this now on the numerator we have e to the Z everybody how much is e to the Z good over two does two change plus we have cosine pi cosine Pi we should know cosine Pi how much is it right 2 +1 so all said and done we've got 1 over 2 + 1 how much is our answer that's it that's how you think about these things work little pieces if if you get infinity over infinity like we would have here you got to do something else so start dividing by either largest or the smallest power in the denominator it's negative so check that out um if you can think through the little pieces and and you get something like this one over a number that's Fant one over a number that's not zero that's fantastic just work on the little pieces you it's going to take some thinking okay this is not super super easy concept you really have to think about what's going on with with each of these little pieces have I explained this well enough for you guys to understand it chopan if I have you're okay with it all right now are you finally ready to do some calculus with these exponentials so far what you should know in this class is this you should know how to find derivatives of natural logorithm anding natural logarithm that's what you should know do you guys feel comfortable with that one that was the first homework we just talked about how to do inverses because then we could get to exponentials inverses of logarithms are exponentials well we've got to talk about how to find derivatives and integrals of exponentials now and that's what we're going to do literally right now and it's going to be so excited you're going to like this one I really think you I like this one this a cool okay so let's talk about derivatives first we'll go right to it how in the world do we find the derivative of e to X how in the world are we going to do that uh well I'll tell you this uh this formula it's actually pretty complicated so if we want to do the derivative of e to the X here's what you do you ready for it it's super it's it's super complicated so I want you to tattoo just like tattoo it on your arm or something so here you go the derivative of e x is e x super hard yeah awesome right I love this one you don't do anything with it it's really weird but what seriously did did you guys know that one already those of you had calculus 2 before you do but if you didn't then that's actually the derivative if you do the derivative of e x you get edx do you want a proof for that one yes super easy proof it's like a really beautifully easy proof so here it is um let's start off with the function itself quick proof yal edx okay there's our function well naturally we don't know any formulas for how to find the derivative edx so we're going to kind of invent one right now way that you invent a formula is to do something you know works so here I'm going to do logarithmic differentiation logarithmic differentiation which you did in your first homework said hey if you don't know what to do or you want to make things easier why don't you try taking Ln on both sides oh look at this this is pretty cool here I've got Ln y here oh what's this it's X because Ln of e to X is X we okay with that one yes no well this is pretty awesome now with logarithmic differentiation you knew that you do implicit so with implicit the derivative of Ln y treating y as a function of X is 1 y * m time dydx equals we'd have to take the derivative here as well what's the derivative of x do you remember with logarithmic differenti are you guys okay with that by the way we took a derivative DDX here we did DDX here we got one we got one over y because that is the derivative Ln l and y would be 1 over y but since it's a function of X you need chain rule hence the dydx after that what do we do sure we're trying to solve [Music] for so if I multiply both sides I get Dy DX = Y and if we if we can if we can we should change that back to the original function so how much was the original function let's look back over there y equals y I love man so what that says is the derivative of e x is actually e x it's pretty cool now we can extend this concept just a little bit with the chain rule chain rule happens in practically everything that we do uh if you don't just have one of these basic derivatives so if we want to extend this then we say suppose you're taking a derivative of e to some function of X listen carefully please so you get this down the first time if you want to take the derivative of e to some function of X it works exactly the same way you leave the original alone and then you multiply by the derivative of the inside just like the Ln derivative remember the one for Ln of whatever you had you put one over the function times derivative of the function do you remember that here you're just going to do the function times the derivative of the function if you like the F prime notation better uh you can write a little bit differently or if you want to see it with 's if you do uh a derivative of e to the U I think this is how a lot of books do it you would have what would you have yeah you you'd have the edu again and then you'd have du DX it's says the function itself times the derivative of the inside basically just the exponent part tell you what I'd like to practice a few of these things just to get our uh our brains around this but I think you'll find that they're fairly straightforward um you obviously need to know what the chain rule is you need to know what the product rule is you need to know all what your trigonometric functions are as far as derivers go but if you know those things this is just one more little piece of the puzzle for calculus so let's try a couple examples maybe two or three okay pretty straightforward question uh do we have chain rule or not here what do you think unless it looks exactly like this then yeah you got a chain rule so unless it looks exactly like something on your uh differentiation table Yeah chain roll for sure so here we got chain roll tell me the first thing that I would write what would I write first e to when we're taking derivatives of these exponentials you don't change the function at first the Dera of e x is e x so the derivative of e x Cub is e x Cub but this acts like your U so do not forget to do what next chain Ru that's right the derivative of can you guys do the derivative ofx Cub that's a piece of cake so we have e tox Cub time what' you say it was 3 it's typically appropriate to write this part first so we'd have - 3x^2 e tox cub okay I want a quick show of hands you feel okay with with that one good do you guys see how this is just one more thing that we have it's still a chain rule but it's just one more rule that we have for derivatives e to the X derivative of that is e to X let's do that it's often helpful to Think Through what rules you're going to need before you actually start on your derivative so let's think about this one X2 e to -2X uh what's the first thing that you should be thinking about in this problem what do you think yeah immediately we see well the thing that holds these together is a product so we're going to need the product rule why don't you guys go ahead and write the product rule I'm going to write up on the board but I want you to practice on your own right now let's check your work and my work do you guys have roughly the same thing these of course can be reversed did you take the derivative of the first one times the second at some place and the Der of the second one times the first at some place fantastic okay now you can help me out with it derivative of x what is that so we get 2x do we change this one right now e -2X perfect plus do we to do a derivative of this one no this is just X2 can you do a derivative of e to -2X let's see if you got it right this should be well that's a chain rule within our product rule here was product rule uh where where am I product rule here that's a chain rule inside of it so we'll have our X2 we'll have our e to the -2X notice we do not change that function at all the first time it's just e to -2X times the derivative of -2X if you find yourself being off by constants by signs a lot like man where is that coming from you're probably missing the chain rule don't forget about the chain rule in these things it is huge what is that derivative anyway so 2x e -2X this would be - 2x 2 e -2X if you got that did you get that so we did it right do you see where the -2 is coming from so this is our -2 we got X2 we got e to -2X tell me one more thing that we could do here say it again coms combine no because we don't have any like terms Factor we can factor for sure we factor out a two we can factor out an X we can factor out an e to the2x this happens a lot with your exponentials because you get this repeating term over and over and over again because every time you take a derivative of e you get it back so we get these these factorizations a lot where we factor out the E so we get a two we get an X we get an e to -2X and if we factor that this becomes 1 - x okay I want to show if hand feel okay with that one you ready try one that's a little bit more tricky yes no okay little more tricky I'm going to have you do most of the work on this I'll help you with the first step so I would like to take the derivative of y = Ln e to the < TK X+ e to the < TK X and you're going what seriously yeah let's do it so I want to do the derivative of this nasty thing let's talk about the first step together what's the first thing that we're going to want to conquer here are we going to start taking derivatives of these guys right now what are we going to start taking derivatives of right now very good do you know how to take the derivative of Ln yes so tell me the first thing I have when I take the derivative of this thing oh I hope that you know derivative of Ln says you do what one original overide good not this right but just the inside so e to the < TK X Plus e to theun X quick head not if you're okay with that so far okay good are we done right now no no unfortunately not that'd be awesome if we were but what do we have to do take this chain rule all the time chain rule so what we're going to do is take the derivative of what's what do we take the Dera of this part yeah that's right Eun X Plus e theun x okay I want to get you started off on this one what's the first thing you're going to have to do in order to take the derivative of these pieces natural log natural log no not natural log because we're taking derivatives here we should know the derivative but I want you to change this a little bit before you start taking derivatives pieces restate it he said how do you restate it what do square roots become okay so off to the side over here so I'm going to do a little sidebar for just this piece we're going to find the derivative of e to the 12 power of X Plus e to thex to 12 we okay with that I want you to do these derivatives use your chain rules here and do both derivatives notice it's not like a product rule it's nothing hard take the derivative of this piece take a derivative of this [Applause] piece for this did you get him I hope so I hope so too let's see if you got them so first thing I would do I would do this one I do the chain rule on it so the chain rule says that I leave it alone I multiply by the derivative of whatever that function is of X so X to the2 show up hands if you made it at least that far I want at least that because you recognize your chain rule did you recognize your chain rule yes yeah okay so plus I I leave it alone I leave it alone so what chain rule says leave it alone multiply by derivative of your function of X your exponent did you make it that far okay these things are not so bad so we have e to the X sorry e to the U X2 time you know you know how to take those derivatives don't you this is a 12 X-2 this is a 12 x to the- 12 all we got to do let's make this into one fraction CU right now it looks really nasty what I want to know is did you make it this far on your own how many people did that's good if you didn't does this make sense to you hello know what do you think yes this is chain rule right alone dtive the inside 12 x^2 alone derivative of the inside - one2 you get the negative X to the2 so far so good okay well if you look at these These are both negative exponents we got a couple terms here but we can write e to x to the 12 over 2 < tkx let's verify that for me two's on the denominator x to the - one2 is on the denominator the 1/2 becomes a square root so far so good okay that changes this to a e the X2 over same thing happens here we've got two we've got a square root of x on the denominator yes no okay lastly do we have a common denominator that's great we can make one fraction out of it so this negative made that to a minus this is our two this is our square root of x right down there in the denominator now we're going to combine these tell me what's on our denominator please on the numerator do some Fancy Pants math I'm change it back to square roots so we got e to the x e to theun X you okay with that one minus right e x okay we're almost done I want to know if you're still with me are you still with me okay almost done what we're going to do now is we took this piece and did like a little little side trip over here so we're going to take this piece times whatever we ended with so yeah don't forget about that right so one over nasty stuff times even more nasty stuff equals the best nasty Stu our answer so here's what we got we got here's here our our derivative this is via the chain rule right here we had the original this is via the Ln the Der Ln so now we're going to put together what we end with is e to < TK x- e to theun X all over 2 < TK x e < TK X Plus e theun x it looks bad but that's our answer do you see where all the pieces are coming from we got our 2x right there we got this part here we get this coming from there can I simplify anything here in here can I simplify this you out like top bottom or E to X yeah you could you could probably do that it's not going to make it look a whole lot better but you could do that I'm talking about can I simplify this right now if you wanted to factor Michael you could do that fact a little bit out but for right here that's what I'm talking about show feel okay with that one okay before we go I want to talk we're not going to do these but I want to talk through them okay I want to see if you can understand the main concept behind each of these starting with this one with that one what would you do for what would your first piece that you would write [Music] be okay so the first piece would be leave this thing alone do you see that and then you'd have the derivative of what would you do for this that's a product rule that's right so you have this piece and then times a derivative that involves a product rule are you with me on that one okay this one what oh this should be an easy one for us what's our first step here five goes down do I change the inside this becomes a times the derivative of this junk and you're going to have a couple chain rules in there do you guys see the chain rules so you're going to have a two you're going to have A3 they'll change that sign here oh this is a good one this is a nasty one uh what's the first thing chain R product rule here so product rule we'd have derivative of the first * the second plus the first * the D of the second uh if you want let's see if I can do this real quick uh this will be e thex tan E X plus this will be e thex see s e x * e x and I believe those go away because you add exponents X Plus X gives you 0 e0 be one I think that's your answer I'll double check that and make sure that it's right uh but does today make sense did today make sense for you all right so we're going to continue we talked about how to do derivatives of edx and we've done a lot of them now we're going to start talking about to do integrals involving e to X and what we can what we can do with that now if you remember from last time what is the derivative of e to the X yeah it was like the easiest one ever well if that's the case if the derivative of e to the x is e to X then um the integral of e DX is what e yeah it's it's it's e DX if the Der is e DX the integral of e DX is e tox and of course yeah we do have to have the plus C here's what that means uh when we see integral of e x it's super easy you just put e to the X and you are done the integral e to X is e to X plus C now of course when we do this we're going to have a lot of chances to do substitution so we're going to have a lot of cases where it's not simply e to the X it's like e to the 3x or e to the X2 X x e to x s something like that where we can do a lot of substitutions so in this section you're going to have a lot of substitutions to do so we're going to practice a few right now uh to see if we can get the hang of are you ready you okay we'll start real simple what I've been telling you is that unless your integral f fits perfectly into your integration table which this is now one more integral that we can do unless it fits perfectly you're probably going to do some sort of a substitution for right now later on we'll have integration by parts or we have trigonometric substitutions things like that but for right now all we know how to do is if it fits perfect you do it if it doesn't fit perfect you manipulate it somehow and one way we can manipulate it is with a substitution can we do a substitution here what do you think substitutions are typically the inside of function so in this case it would be the exponent and the derivative has to be somewhere in the integral disregarding the constants so will a substitution work let's try one what would you pick for a substitution notice we're not going to pick e to 2x because when you take the derivative of e it pops back up again does that make sense so you'd have to have another E to 2x in there to simplify that we don't have that so if we pick U = let's just try the 2x what's the derivative of 2x 2 DX or du over 2 = DX okay tell me how this changes instead of e 2x I'm going to have e to the U perfect instead of DX I'm going to have du over two what can I do with that two and what's it become 12 so then this becomes 12 well let's look at it did it work did we get rid of all the x's and have only use left are you guys awake today did we get rid of all the x's and have only U left how that turn it was magic don't worry I'm Change magic math how about that one better our U matches our U so we know that we're correct also did we change this into something in our integration table can we do that now that's the idea of a substitution so now that we do this we leave the one 12 alone we get what e u the integral of e VI is nice and then there's one more thing we're deal with the plus C and just a bit there's one more thing I want to do here very good if you start with x's you better give me X's here so if we start with X we need this in terms of X so we can do 12 e to 2X then we put a plus c okay I want to see if you're okay with that are you guys okay with that yeah it's the simplest one that I can think of uh we just do a substitution substitution just a constant no problem integral of e to is e to question is it always going to work like that where you can theoretically just pull the two and take the up front if that's just like a 3X yeah absolutely this going to be 1/3 if that's a 7x it'll be 17 now of course you're not going to get them that easy all right so if that's the case sure by all means that's exactly the thing because we'd have to do a substitution anyway most of the ones we're going to deal with are probably stuff that looks like this this one granted is probably not so easy to do in your head it it doesn't follow this pattern exactly so we're not going to be able to do that really easy but the idea is the same the idea is try to make this fit your integration table does this fit our integration table the way it is right now not even not even close so we're going to have to manipulate we're going to have to find some substitution let's think about the substitution right now okay think this through should I pick this entire e to the 2x as my substitution no no because I'm going to get that back again remember the derivative you always get the e to the function back again so we'd get this e to 2x back again I don't see that anywhere so it's not going to it's not going to simplify that would be a problem are you guys with me on that okay is that a good substitution the X squ the derivative of this is 2x do you see a 2X anywhere also if even if that was there would it possibly get rid of this and that would be a problem i' have U's and X's you can't have that so what's the only other alternative if we can't pick the whole thing here we can't pick this thing what am I going to pick two yeah it's usually the inside of something so let's pick the the uh the U equal to 2x now I don't like seeing the two over the X so let's change that instead of 2 overx we can write that as 2 good we okay with that one so far our next step the substitution come on quickly next step is to do what so du equals how we take derivatives bring it down so that's -2 x to the -2 DX very good you guys okay with this so far yeah now if we do a little bit of manipulation you're going to see a couple nice things firstly that's a negative exponent which we typically don't like to have so if we have du we can set that equal to -2 over x^2 DX look back at your integral do you see that this thing's going to work yeah there's an x s here's an x s DX now I do things a little bit differently I like to solve for DX that's how I was ta so if I multiply both sides by X2 I get x^2 du if I divide by -2 it's over -2 equals DX let's see if that works I know we're still going to have an integral am I still going to have e to the 2x am I still going to have e yes absolutely I haven't substituted for that so I have an e what does the 2x change to that's our U is it still going to be over X2 well that depends on how you do your integral if you like to substitute uh this part right here for your du then no if you do it like I just have done it I'll switch back and forth to give you both aspects of this if you do it like I do it you'll have an x s here and instead of DX you'll now have X x^2 du over -2 does that make sense to you instead of DX I now have this piece for DX so instead of DX I have this in my case this is the way I like to do it because I can see stuff cross out I like to make sure my constants are all there uh that's just personally my preference you can do it a different way if you'd like to do my X squ simplify yes fantastic as soon as you see that you oh that's so nice I only have 's it's it's a du integral so we're good to go tell me something I can do with this -2 so i'm- 12 integral e u du can we do the integral of e to U yes yeah that's easy what's the integral of e to U so we're going to have -2 e to the U plus c plus c for sure there's one thing I'm going to do before I put put my plus C so I know that I'm not done I'm going to resubstitute in for that U so how much is our u 2 so we have -2 e 2x plus C that's the whole idea so P feel okay with the whole idea how can you check your work what do you mean go backwards be more specific take the do the derivative if you wanted to do the derivative you certainly could do it just do that one okay well if you had dtive of this piece is going to come back isn't it so Dera of this chain rule says go at 2 x to1 and bring down the 1 the negatives would go away the twoos would go away this would be X to uh -2 that would be overx S so we know that we're right on this one show up hands feel okay with that example it's a little more complicated right but can you do it just a substitution try these substitutions you're going to have a lot of them you guys want a couple more is this helping you at all hey let's think hard about this one firstly does this fit our integration table exactly the way it is no no it's not even close oh here's a good question for you guys who uh love algebra so much can I split up this fraction 19 no you can't split up denominators you could split up numerators but not denominators so we can't split this so we're going have to we're going to have to attack it directly now the only way we can attack this thing is with a substitution if it doesn't fit our integration model we need to substitute let's pick out a good substitution for this one would a good substitution be this e to thex no no if I pick this one the derivative is negative e tox but it won't cross this one out because that's connected with our plus does that make sense yeah okay what's a how about just this e to the negative X where I want to pick that one no well same basic idea this one would get rid of this one but well what about the one so let's go ahead and that's actually might work a little bit but to make things a little bit easier for us what are we going to take take a whole thing that way we have a u here we know the integral of that's already be going to be so that's nice we don't have to do a double substitution to a single one if you picked this you'd have to substitute again later and we want to create as as little substitution as few substitutions as possible so if we take U equals 1 + e x and we take our derivative everybody what's our derivative of 1 Z that's kind of nice that's why we picked it here so that whole thing goes away we don't have to worry about 1 plus u and then do another substitution to get Ln now we have just you here that's what we're going to end up with how about the derivative of e to thex Let's do why don't you do that one on your own see if you can do that so write it out real quick so this of course is zero we all know that one find the derivative of that remember with derivatives of e to the x or e to a function of X we leave the function alone so the derivative is e to thex but I'll tell you something if you're off by constants a lot or you're off by man I don't know where this x is coming from you're probably forgetting the chain R here so what you need to make sure you do is with all these e all these e functions don't forget the chain rule so the chain rule says sure I'm going to keep the E tox but I'm going to multiply by the derivative what's the derivative ofx so du actually equals e tox DX is it going to work yeah do you see it do you see it in the integral check this out some of you guys were taught to do integrals this way do you see the E to X DX up here y you can do that substitution pull the negative over here this is going to equal negative du if you know how to do integrals that way do it that way don't care if you learn how to do them like I did you can solve for it and now we can do our substitution so why don't you tell me just left side people you guys over here tell me please what is on the top of my inte depends on the way do it for the way I'm doing it what's on the top of my integral right now mm how about on the bottom of my integral what am I going to have there you can say it out loud and here I'm going to have du over e tox I'm substituting instead of DX I now have du overx so instead of DX I'm doing my substitution this stays this becomes a u and now we get to cross those out we can simplify e thex is gone tell me one thing I'm going to do before I start my integral yeah let's do that so this becomes the negative integral of what's inside there one U oh how about that look at that can you do the integral of one over U you can how much is the integral one over u l absolute value U perfect I like the absolute value so negative Ln absolute value of U I'm going to put a plus c after I make sure that I substitute back in there I don't want to put a plus c and then go oh I'm done I you don't want to do that okay if you want to put the plus C now you can uh but I like to do it later just so I don't forget that this was in terms of X I don't want to leave it in terms of U that's not the idea here so instead of negative Ln absolute value U we put negative Ln absolute value of what's in there 1 e plus now we put it plus C please keep that absolute value unless you can get rid of it now I want you to look at that real careful one + e to thex can this ever be negative no okay so you can choose to leave it if you want to in my class but in the back of the book they're probably not going to have the absolute value they're probably going to have this Ln 1 + e x because the absolute values are Irrelevant in this case it can't be negative doesn't matter plus c did that one make sense to you okay yeah tell you what let's try we'll do one more together we'll talk about one more and then we're pretty much done with this section we'll move on are these easy medium or hard are they more understandable now are you starting to get the idea here man I I I bet you you guys are going be Pros to substitution after this I know you learned it in your last class but we use it so often it's just incredible we use it all the time until we get to chapter okay integral e tox see e oh my goodness that's nasty enough for you in the morning is it let's try to find this out is this a uh is this something that fits in our integration table the way it is right now no not even close I see a see that's kind of cool cuz we we now know the integral of secant that's fine and we know the integral of e tox but not all of it together if you if you forgot about this what you can and can't do what you can't do is just take the integral of each little piece you can't do that when they're multiplied together when they're added sure but not when they're multiplied so we're going to have to use a substitution to try to change this into something that fits our integration table let's talk about a substitution would a substitution be good for this e to thex if you picked it you'd get it back again but will this cross this out no this is the argument of an angle you cannot cross that out okay argument of se you can't cross that out would it be a good idea to take this entire thing as your substitution still remember that you have to do derivatives correct so the derivative of secant is secant tangent do you see a secant tangent anywhere up here no a bad choice what's the appropriate choice for our substitution here the the E tox inside the SEC yeah that's the appropriate one if we pick this one we just dealt with this so I'm not going to bore you with asking you again the derivative of e to thex is e to thex DX uh again do you understand where the negative is coming from tell me where that comes from please R perfect chain rule okay so hey is it going to work yeah this is this piece we can make a substitution if you like doing it this way if you like doing that substitution here's one way you can uh you can solve for it so a different just a different method of showing this put the negative over here so negative du any constants over here and the substantial portion of your substitution here this piece is this piece this now these together become negative du do you guys see that it's a different way to think about that so here's an integral if I do my substitution tell me what's left on the inside of my integral please on the left hand side you guys what's what's in here still secant very good I like the see uh did you say U or e thex u okay and now if I take my e tox DX e tox DX all together becomes tell me what we're going to do with the negative the front so I'm going to move up here man we're almost done does it fit our integration table now yeah that's the whole idea of substitution is make it fit make it work I know it's going to be negative oh do you remember the integral of secant we did it a few classes definitely Ln which was kind of interesting when you think about it inside there should be secant U tangent U correct plus oh yeah sorry Plus close the absolute value tell me one more thing everybody we're going to do before we end this problem put your U Back In okay so negative Ln absolute value see what is our U anyway there we got breadcrumb Trail tell us what to do I'm going to put some parentheses there plus tangent e thex absolute value plus C sorry that's all scrunchy I got to fit it on the screen so negative Ln absolute value secant E X Plus tangent e thex and absolute value plus oh my gosh if you had that the first day of class kind of be crying now is it hard can you understand it at least yes it's doable you guys can do this you can if you can do a substitution you can do this we now know what derivative of e is we need to make sure we have chain rules that's going to give you a different sign up front if you forget the chain rule okay you need to remember that now we have substitution and we understand how to take derivatives we're good to go I'm going to talk about one more we're not going to finish this problem but I want to talk about it [Applause] you know one of the hardest parts for students is picking the appropriate substitution now of course if you pick the wrong one it should be apparent to you really quick but you waste time so let's think through what the appropriate substitution would be in this case and maybe you can try this one later at your own convenience uh you tell me good or bad this piece good or bad that' be bad because it's not going to cross out anything this piece good or bad this piece good well it would cross out this one and that but I'd still have X's right there that would be a problem won't get rid of everything does that make sense isn't that the same as that so both of them would be do you know how to do a lnu over youu me neither so let's make a different one well I can but it's a different different topic we haven't covered that yet okay how about this inside would that be a good choice if I did this one I'm going to get edx back again I'd have Ln U and I'd have an e over edx this would cross out this would not cross out you have to in with it this is your appropriate Choice your U here should be Ln e x + 1 and here's how I know that if I do the Ln e x + 1 look what Ln gives us back look if you take the derivative you're going to get one over this does that make sense yeah here's one over this and then you have a chain rule you're going to get edex back again here's edex back again if you do that use substitution this thing works out perfectly it's really easy okay so try that later uh try looking through that seeing that that is the correct substitution try that problem show hands if you feel okay on the stuff we've covered so far any question questions at all is it becoming easier for you I hope well get used to substitutions and it will it will become easier I promise now the next thing we're going to do is we're going to take this one step further instead of just doing derivatives and integrals that involve e to the X an exponential we're going to talk about exponentials in general where the base is not just e but where the bases any other number a constant for instance or even another function of that X so when we start section 6.4 we're going to discuss General exponential functions and general logarithmic functions instead of just dealing with e DX and lnx we're going to have any base to DX and a logarithm of any Bas besides

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 6.5:  Calculus of Inverse Trigonometric Functions
all right so our lesson today is going to be on inverse trig functions we're going to learn how to take derivatives take integrals but first we're going to study just what these things mean what they look like what the the functions graph as why we can even do it what the domain is what the range is we're going to start with just the idea of what a trig function is now I want you to think about what it means to be an inverse compared to a function there was one qualification that we had to have in order to guarantee that we actually could find it inverse a function had to be this in order to have a inverse what 1 one it's got to be 1: one now I want you to think of trig functions all the ones that you know are trig functions one: one is tangent considered one well tangent does this but then over here does this do you have to restrict the domain that's right what about sign is sign one to one from Z to Pi heck no it does this all all the time right and so do cosine but if we do restrict the domain then we can change these functions into something that can have an inverse so if we think about trick function General no they're not one: one but if we restrict the domain then we make them we kind of force them to be one to one for a little area which means that our inverses of trig functions are going to have very specific domains does that make sense to you so we're going to talk about inverses of trig functions but only on certain domains not for the whole thing because you can't do that then it would not be the inverse would actually be a function so so we need a restrict domain then we can have inverse trat functions let me give you an example here real quick so if we look at y = sin x will if you remember what y sinx looks like does this one start at zero or start at one so this looks okay here's one and negative one where's it Peak do you remember and our function goes up Peaks hit zero at Pi goes down bottoms out hit Z at 2 pi so we get the this that looking graph obviously that hopefully to you is not one to one it does not pass the horizontal line test in fact no portion of this unless we go from here to here is actually one: one we don't want to consider that so we're going to take this function and even go a little bit left with it so if we go left a little bit say/ 2 what's uh what's S of/ 2 yeah that would be down here the idea is let's not consider sign for the entire domain because obviously it's not 1: one and in order to find an inverse we have to have a function that is 1: one so what we've done to make the these things easier not have a a domain that's way over here to have a domain that's kind of nice for us to work with that has a zero in it because we like to have domains with zeros in it's really nice we says no we're not going to consider from here to here cuz that's obviously not 1: one from here to here is 1: one but it's it's not a nice domain that we like to work with P that it's not one to one anyway but right here between 2 and pi/ 2 we're going to eliminate all this other stuff and focus on this domain so if we focus on the domain and restrict it toga Pi / 2 to Pi / 2 do you guys see that s becomes one one: one on that domain yes no okay good so yal sinx cool on the domain of Pi / 2 to Pi 2 is 1 to one and that's what we want again if a function is 1 to one it must have an inverse therefore we say okay cool we can find an inverse on this domain and what I'm going to do is uh I'm going to rewrite this just a little bit I'm going to get rid of all this stuff if sign is one to one on that domain then we can find an inverse for it and what we're going to do is for the rest of this our time in uh in this little subsection here I'm going to give you an original function trig function we're going to talk about the inverse so what the domain is what the range is and then what the inverse is domain and range is you guys ready for it so with sign what's the domain again cool that's right do you remember what the difference between brackets and parentheses are brackets include it include it and the parentheses don't include it so domain is this range I'm sorry what was the range one more time perfect oops I just went over that too huh brackets includes it now if we talk about the inverse remember what inverse does what an inverse does is it switches the X and the Y it switches the domain with the range so a couple notes that that we have um just a few of them so a little bit of a note here first one we're going to use this in a little bit not right now but in a little bit why = sin inverse of x if and only if s of y equal x that's the only that's the only only way we can have this so inverse functions work where we switch our X into y so y sin inverse of x if and only if s of yal X also couple other things inputs get interchanged with outputs which means that domain gets interchanged with range so if this is our sign y = sin x then we should be able to find and inverse for it let's talk about it you make that a little bigger so we can see it better okay so uh a couple important things again since this is one: one we have to find an inverse since we know about inverses already there Reflections across the diagonal y equal x what that means is that our our inputs change with our outputs our X's become y's our y's become X's so let's look at this from our domain and range and see what we can get for our picture over here from our points see we for our picture over here so if the point Pi / 2 1 if the point P / 2 1 is on my original graph the point 1 Pi / 2 will be on my inverse graph does that make sense Pi 2 1's on this one therefore 1 comma Pi / 2 is here does that make sense to you ifunk /21 is on my original graph on the inverse I should have 1 commk / 2 if 0 0 is on my original graph 0 0 is also going to be on my inverse now right now it looks almost the same but the curve the curve is switched notice if I reflect this it's not going to be doing this anymore it's going to be doing this it's not going to be doing this anymore it's going to be doing this and that's the way this inverse sign looks so our inverse sign function looks like that about like that I'm not the best artist in the world but hopefully you get the picture here uh show pans feel okay with with that one so with our inverses we can find them just from our original functions by interchanging our x's and our y's now also let's talk about the domain and the range of these this is going to be important for you you do have to consider the domain and the range of your functions and your inverse trig function so tell me something about the domain what's the domain of our inverse sign or sign inverse perfect so with sin inverse we're not talking about plugging in pi that's out of the domain we can only plug in from1 to one do you understand look it if you can only get out think about sign when you plug in anything to sign all you can get out is between 1 and 1 right if range becomes domain that means for inverses you can only plug in1 to one you can't plug in anything bigger than that or smaller than1 you guys getting the idea here so our domain is for sure1 to one how about the range that's right basically these just switch now we're going to use the same idea we're going to go a little bit quicker through this since I've already explained the idea of being 1: one we're going to define a section of a trig function that is 1: one and we're going to start switching around the X and the Y then we're going to switch the domain with the range and get the domain and range of our inverse functions are you guys okay with this one before we go on yes okay let's let's keep going then um how about cosine where's cosine start okay so if we went any further this way we'd have something that's not one to one so we're going to start this domain of cosine at zero so domain normally does this we don't want [Applause] that so we're going to ignore everything but the range from zero [Music] to what's that one good what's this one so we want Z to Pi so we don't care about this we don't care about this firstly did we Define a section of our graph that is one: one okay yes yes okay tell me the domain that we're going to be working with for our our cosine zero pi and the range of this little one: one section is good this is still 1 this is still one so1 to one quick head not if you're okay with that one so far that's just your regular coine now let's make it inverse because it's one: one we know that we can do this so let's see if we can do it um tell you what if the1 is on my original function if 0 1's on my original what's on my inverse perfect that's there if pi1 is on my function what's on my inverse if one Z is on my function and we get something looks like this wow that's really nasty sorry I hope you get the idea of it my graphs are not that great oh you know what um that's why that's Mr Leonard being I made a mistake here did you catch my mistake I hope that you did I I made a mistake here I said something wrong I want you to catch it I said 01 is on this graph is z I'm sorry 1 Z is one Z on that graph no what is that actually probably would have made it better if I would have put pi over two yeah so which is why I got a funny graph over here if Pi / 2 Zer on my graph then 0 Pi / 2 remember this is pi and this is right between Pi / 2 that looks a little bit better my mistake on that let's talk about domain and range what's our new domain for inverse function how about a range 0 to five these two just switch we still okay with these ones okay we got several more to do so we're going to kind of kick it up a little bit let's talk about uh tangent now naturally tangent does this repeating thing right it's those S curves that repeat over and over and over again so hopefully for you it makes sense that we're going to Define this between / 2 where we have an Asm toote to P over two tangent looks about like that now since this is one to one on that domain our domain isun 2 to Pi 2 someone out there tell me should I use brackets for this or parentheses for that okay cuz I can't actually get there now our range our range is interesting it's a little bit different from before what's our range [Music] that's right goes it's so negative Infinity to Infinity which means for our inverse we can find it is 1: one here's what happens with this of course 0 0 hopefully see this 0 0 is on original 0 0 is going to be on the inverse if I have ASM tootes at X = PK / 2 and x = / 2 on the inverse I'm going to have ASM tootes at y = piun / 2 and Y = piun 2 does that make sense to you so this graph is going to be reflected that includes our ASM tootes so here's / 2un / 2 now what this one says is that as we approach x = < / 2 we approach y = positive Infinity did you see that that means as we get y closer to p 2 x is going to approach positive Infinity so we have this look and that's our inverse function for for tangent okay quick so hands feel okay with these ones so far do you have this written down because I got to erase it but we are going to reference this so keep in mind the the domains of these things okay I'm going to be referencing the domains of s and the domains of sin inverse a lot and so same thing with cosine and tangent I'm going to try to fit the three remaining ones over here so we can use them um but keep these things in mind okay what's the next one we got what do you want to do yeah we can do cosecant we start with sign may as well do [Applause] cosecant if you forgotten how cosecant looks it's those ones with the U's that's like if you took a took sign and exploded it and so instead of doing this it does this so it has these 's everywhere here's how it looks we have 1 And1 so we're still touching that but we're not between 1 Anda 1 we're outside of it we got Pi / 2 we got / 2 and they look like this now are those one to one no not even close so if they're not one to one we got to erase them with this graph what we're going to choose to do is we're going to keep our domain as simple as possible our domain is going to stick right here we're going to erase this and that so really what we're looking at is just this piece of the graph this piece and this piece that's going to be the domain that we restrict for cosecant because otherwise we don't have a one: one function you guys all right with this so far now let's look at what the domain of this thing actually is our domain what is our domain what can we plug into this all plug in between okay we start at over 2 you guys see that right Zer okay so piun / 2 can we actually plug in PK 2 can we plug it in yes there's a point there where do we go to Z can we actually plug in zero no that's a problem so we're going to go to zero we're going to put a little parentheses there saying I can't plug in zero do you guys see why we can't plug in zero we have an ASM toote here and here we can't plug plug that in but we can start just on the other side of zero and go to where oops and we can actually get P two so we can basically plug in anything between piun / 2 and Pi / 2 except for what number yeah that's the idea now let's talk about the range I'll give you negative Infinity I like the negative infinity negative Infinity up to where do we stop one can we actually get the negative one yes now is there anything between negative 1 and one no so we got to pick this thing back up again at one and go to positive Infinity what that means for our inverse is that our domain and range are going to switch so when we do y = cose inverse it's a little weird to think about but here we go we'll start off kind of Simply I'm going to eras these because those are Irrelevant for us if we have pi over 2 1 on this graph then 1 piun / 2 is going to be on this graph if we havek 2 1 then we're going to get1 negative / 2 here we okay with that we sure as we get closer to zero we're going to positive Infinity on the Y so as we get closer to zero we're going to go positive Infinity on the X and likewise here and that's a look for cosecant inverse tell me what the domain is please domain should be pretty easy for you guys what's the domain for our cose inverse say what here well yeah the domain is actually a little bit easier to see for me Infinity 1 inclusive one to Infinity in fact it should be exactly this our range should be exactly this and hopefully you can see that it is are you guys okay with that one it's a little weird right well it was for me the first time I saw it years and years ago but are you okay with that one so we know that hey Pi / 2 1 no no no 1 pi/ 2K 2 1 no 1K 2 Infinity at positive y's Infinity at positive X's that's the idea I think I'm going to run out of room here on this next one I'll have to do the other one over here so let's do what am I missing I got a s cosine tangent Co let's do co uh let's do see secant looks really really similar to cosecant it's only shifted over just like cosine looks really similar sign it's only shift it over so when we shift this over what we actually get is at one negative 1 this looks like that and this that's how secant looks graphically we see that at zero we got one at Pi we got negative 1 can we plug in Pi / 2 no remember that secant is one over cosine and if you plug in pi cosine you get zero and so if we do that we'd have something that's undefined that's where these as toes are actually coming from is the one over zeros that we have so is this one: one right now no let's erase this and this and then we do have something that's one to one from this little piece will erase this whole side and this little piece erase this whole side can you tell me what the domain is [Music] talking about the domain the domain we can plug in zero that's good yeah we can plug in zero and you can plug it in where does it go to can you plug in p/ two okay so no but then we start up at pi over 2 again and we end up getting to or Pi Pi that's right and we can actually plug in pi how about the rain oh let's do the rain what can you get out of this thing number and that's right so any number between there saysa Infinity to 1 inclusive and then 1 to positive Infinity so now we get to go ahead and do the inverse here we go if 01 is on our original graph then 1 Z is on my new graph let's see if pi1 is on my original graph then -1 Pi is on my inverse graph if we did a horizontal ASM toote sorry a vertical ASM toote of Pi 2 we're going to have a horizontal one at pi/ 2 for inverse as we went positive along the Y we were ASM totic to pi/ 2 so as we go horizontal along the X we're going to be ASM totic and same thing here make sure I get all these things right let's see our domain and a range what's our domain for this next one yeah look at this infity to 1 and then one to Infinity range should be exactly like this domain and we've got one more that you guys have questions on these two do you have these written down especially the domain in the range yes m okay coent coent if you'll remember looks like a shifted over and inverted tangent so it still has an ASM toote at Z and at Pi it only looks like this though like that where our domain is 0 to Pi but not inclusive and a range is what please so with our cotangent inverse if we have ASM tootes vertical ASM tootes at 0 and Pi we got horizontal ASM tootes at 0 and Pi if Pi / 2 0 is on our graph then 0 pi2 on our [Applause] inverse let's see Pi we're doing netive Infinity so Pi we're doing negative Infinity here and that's the graph sorry about the bad graph on that one but that's the graph for our cotangent inverse and we'll do the domain and range and be done with this stuff gets pretty Dy pretty fast domain is negative Infinity to infinity and then range is 0 to Pi oh my gosh thank goodness we're finally done with those things U what I want to know out of this is do you understand where the inverses are coming from did you see the the development of those I don't want to just give you the inverse say this is what it looks like but hopefully you've seen the relationship do you guys see the relationship x's and y's are just changing domains and rs are just changing that's the whole idea here now what we're going to do just to get our heads wrapped around this is practice a few examples of using some inverses seeing what it looks like so we're going to evaluate evaluate just means uh find out the answer what I'm of this expression I'm giving you so let's look at this one I want to find out what sin inverse of 12 is sin inverse of/ 12 equals y how much is y think about what inverses are in relationship to their original trink functions and this will help you a lot so think about it this way sin inverse of 12 = y if and only if s of y equals 12 do you see how to change between an inverse and the original you just switch your Y and your in your output your input your domain and your range your X and your y so if sin inverse of/ 12 equals y well then sin y has to equal 1/2 are you guys okay on that switch then you think in your head or you use your unit circle and you think okay well well uh what angle do I have to plug in here to give me a sign of 1/2 keep in mind what's the domain what's the domain of your sign that we've restricted it to look at your domain right now for sign what's the domain of the sign okay so whatever you find it's got to be between pk/ 2 and Pi 2 so we restricted to the fourth and first quadrants does that make sense to you so just look there look on your unit circle and figure out okay what is it six five or six five or six what that means for us is that sin inverse of 12 equals / 6 notice this the range the range of sign inverse wask / 2un 2 because the domain we restricted for sign wask 2K / 2 is this in the domain I'm sorry in the range of sin inverse is it between pi/ 2 and Pi / 2 okay so that's that's one key I want you to understand is that this had to be the appropriate range of sign inverse and domain of sign because they're the same thing it's got to be in the range of sin inverse and the domain of sign they're the same in this Cask 2 Tok / 2 since it is we know that we've done this one right are you guys okay with that one so far are you sure are there any questions on that I want to make sure yall get it before we go on having fun yet we're not really even doing calculus huh just doing tree right now don't worry we'll get to Cal soon enough uh how about cosine in inverse of this so cosine inverse of < TK 32 = y remember this is if and only if can you restate that on your own if I say cosine inverse ofk 3 2 = y can you tell me what the original the the inverse of that would be cosine of perfect now now look at your papers look at notes here and tell me what is the range of cosine inverse or likewise same thing what's the domain of cosine 0 to Pi so whatever you find here whatever this is it has to be between Z and Pi that means you restrict your unit circle to the first two quadrants remember that all students all things are positive only sign is positive so cosine this is probably going to be in the second quadrant because we have something oh shoot you know what I forgot the negative uh let's make that negative all right that's for funsies okay so if we you know what we'll do both if I didn't have the negative what quadrant would it be okay if I do have the negative what quadrant is it okay we just learned something so because this is negative > 3 over2 I'm not thinking first quadrant I'm thinking second quadrant I'm not thinking any other ones because that's outside of the domain of this I'm thinking only 0 to Pi have you thought about how much that is remember that cosine counts up so cosine counts up uh of 4 over two 3 two of two over two of 1 over two and then of 0 over two then it counts back down > 1 over two of two over two 3 over two of 4 over two so NE but negative so this one would be exactly right so if we find out that Y is 5K 6 then we we've solved our problem then we know that cosine inverse of > 32 is 5 6 that's the idea here are we okay with the idea so far I know that some of you don't like trig so much are you understanding this part of it yeah your unit circle is going to be pretty important right okay tan inverse < TK 3 = y t inverse < tk3 = y this happens if and only if tan y = < TK 3 can you please give me the restricted domain of our tangent very good restricted domains 2 to two that means that whatever we find has to be in the fourth or first quadrants are you with me on that one fourth or fourth or first quadrants all students take okay so force forc or first over anyway so the right side of the circle yeah that's right it's the right side so can you think of uh all students take calculus tangent is positive in the 1 and negative in the fourth we're looking at positive angles here so this has to be in quadrant number one can you think of what gives you tangent 3 5 3 yeah yes so then y equals 3 that means that tan inverse of the < TK 3 = P3 that's the way we look at these things we first find out okay well translate this back into its original function rather than inverse look at the original functions we're better at that we have unit circles that help us with that then we think about in in the domain that we we've restricted what's the appropriate angle that's going to give us this relationship find out that appropriate angle make sure that it is actually the the correct quadrant and then we just restate it sin inverse of2 is 5 or six and so on and so forth so if F feel okay with this so far now if you ever come across something like this cosine inverse of 6 I don't have anything on my unit circle that says 6 okay so what I'm going to do with this I'm going to use my calculator so when you get something like this just use your calculator you have the cosine inverse on your calculator make sure it's in radians please make sure it's in radians and then just do that don't don't do it now just try it on your own later just use your calculator so these ones I don't want you using your calculator here I don't want to get random weird decimal numbers I want you to really work on it if it's a number like2 32 of 3 those ones that you you see on the unit circle do it this way if it's 6 234 use your calculator the this am I getting three of you guys on that one so try doing this if you can't do it then use your calculator okay now we're going to continue here now what we're going to try is compounding some of these trigonometric relationships they get a little funky but I'm going give you two ways to work on it both of them are really good ways so I'll show you right now [Applause] what if I asked you to find tangent of cosine inverse of 12 and you go please no I don't want to do that pull the inside out you can you actually this one's kind of easy really when you think about this one's easy I'm going to give you two ways to do it if it's an easy number like2 a number that appears on your unit circle you can do it this way think about what cosine inverse is so cosine inverse cosine inverse of 12 would equal let's call it Theta that means that cosine Theta would have to equal one are you guys okay with that change do you see what I'm talking about here if cosine inverse of 1 have Theta Call Ita then cosine Theta would equal 12 you you switch the X and the Y tell me what angle gives you 1 12 when you put it into cosine pi over 3 so then Theta would equal pi over three are we okay with that one you sure well look at that this is what we called Theta so we know that cine inverse 12 = < 3 that that's what we know this sorry is what you put in here can you find tangent of Pi 3 can you do that how much is tent of Pi 3 just Square three did that did I blow your minds with that one I don't want to blow your minds but really what we're doing huh we did that in trig yeah you did this in trig I just want to make sure you can still do it now that you're not in trig can you still do it now that you're not in trig okay so we take the the inside cosine inverse of 1/2 no problem this is pi 3 just plug in the pi 3 to tangent you getun of three does that make sense there is another way to look at this when these get harder you can do it this way from right here you go okay tell you what let's consider coine = 12 draw yourself a triangle that has the relationship OFA of cosine Theta so here's our Theta if cosine theta equals 12 please tell me the the side relationship of right triangle for cosine it is what over what very good adjacent over adjacent over hypotenuse we okay with that one find the missing side can you find the missing side sure so how much is it this would be the sare < TK of 2 2 - 1 2 3 Now now find the trigonometric relationship that you're looking for trig function that you're looking for so if we know that this is cosine thet just find tangent of that so tangent Thea would equal tangent is opposite over adjacent < TK 3 1 or simply < 3 so there's really two ways to do it you can do it just directly with it or you can make a triangle out of it if you make a triangle take this relation Shi take the inside here's the steps take the inside find the original trig function WR drw yourself triangle whatever you get out of that triangle find the trig function of this new triangle of that angle and that's very easy do you guys want to try one more yes I'll show you one that you can't do the other way that you have to use a triangle so what's the first thing we want to do the let's take the inside let's do sin inverse of 1/3 what are we going to call that let's Call Ita yeah let's call that Theta so look what we're doing look look at the word this piece right now is Theta does that make sense to you so when we draw a triangle that Theta is the same Theta so if I'm trying to find of this that's just find of that triangle you're you're good to go relating to the Theta the angle that you called it does that make sense so okay so sin inverse of 1/3 equal if and only if sin Theta = 13 just switch them you okay with that so far now there's nothing on my unit circle that has a 1/3 this is going to take a triangle sign give me the relationship for sign what two sides do opposite hypotenuse usually you'll have to find the other one so let's find the other one here uh okay that would be the square root of that one no what one two three that one do you guys know how to use pyan theorem Square this one square this one one subtract them put square root around it there you go you got it this is it two2 now find Cent OFA OFA look at this of theta isent of this thing it's the same thing so this is Theta this is Theta so just find of thent now if tangent is opposite over adjacent Cent is it's the reciprocal so we're going to get what that means for us is that coent of sin inverse of 1/3 is 2 < tk2 that's what we're required to find in this problem is there ever going to be any domain restrictions though when we start doing this you do have to make sure these fit the domain now of course this is within this is within our domain for sin inverse between sure if it's not then you can't do it uh you know what that's not completely I'll show you one that that we we fail the domain I'll show you how to work with it um actually right now so a couple properties of inverses that we have are these for these are all true if the domains are correct so what we're looking at right here the X has to be in this domain so this is only true if x is between -1 and 1 because that's the domain that's the domain of sin inverse are you guys follow me on this on this that's like a function this has the domain of this correct so then in order for this to actually work this x would have to be in the appropriate domain if it's not then we got an issue this works if it's in the appropriate domain again same1 to one this works if it's in the appropriate domain domain for Tan inverse Wasa Infinity to Infinity do you remember these domains from the inverses that we just did Sin inverse had this domain cosine inverse had the same domain tan inverse has this domain now check this out please look when we switch them around the domain changes so it depends on what is inside and what is outside yes it's true that whenever you have a a trig function next to its inverse or you compose them basically a trig function with its inverse a trig function onto its inverse whenever you do that yeah it's it's it's undoing it that's what inverses do they undo each other so we're going to get x x x x x provided that this is the argument of your inside function is in the domain of the inside function so for instance this has to be in the domain of sin inverse in the domain of this in the domain of this this would have to be in the domain of sign that we restricted this is no longer - 1 to 1 it's actually piun / 2 to piun / 2 this is no longer 1 to1 it's actually zero to Pi this is no longer negative Infinity to Infinity it's piun / 2 to Pi 2 I'll give you uh just two very very quick examples about how you would do this watch carefully if I wanted s sin inverse of3 here's how you do it you look here is this in the appropriate domain for for instance this is sin inverse so is 3 between1 and 1 then this problem is really easy if this is within this domain you oh cool the answer is3 zero work a trig function will undo its respective inverse that is what will happen provided that is in the domain so if that's between -1 and one for my inverse function Booyah we're done what happens sometimes though is you get this now we can work with it you just got to work around it so check this out cosine inverse of cosine 3i / 2 two things about it firstly look at cosine 3i / 2 is this in the appropriate domain no no so you cannot do this this does not equal 3 2 it's not true here's what you do you think about how much cosine 3i 2 actually is how much is cosine of 3i 2 Z it's zero then if you change this to what it actually is cosine inverse of 0 cosine inverse of well okay that's between there that's fine we can actually do that so cosine inverse of 0 what do you need what angle do you need to get zero out of your cosine think about it this way if you need to cosine thet = 0 between uh sorry coine between Z and Pi cosine of what gives you zero please this so it's not 3i / 2 it's actually two so sometimes even if it's not in the appropri domain you change this one you look at what it actually is this really is zero then do cosine inverse of zero that'll be in your domain and then you can work with it so P feel okay with with that part okay cool Okay so we've learned a lot about inverse trig functions already we learned some a few identities how to work with them a little bit what the angles mean in reference to our original trig functions now we're going to move over to derivatives and in just a little bit we're going to talk about integrals that involve some of these inverse functions also if you ever read or hear arc sign or Arc cosine that's what these mean as well they're inverses as well so here's our derivatives now they look a little weird uh why why in the world do these deres look the way they do I'm going to put them up on the board and at first you might be kind of curious is where they come from I'll prove a couple just two of them for you to show you where these are actually coming from so here's our derivatives this is another thing that you're going to want to write down uh like on your your paper to have next to you when you're doing your homework um I I'll talk a little bit later about about our tests in this class but write these down and have these next to you okay we're going to need these so here we go so s inverse our derivative if you want to do the derivative of s inverse it really doesn't look like cosine or anything that's not the way these inverses work the Der of s inverse is actually oh you know what can you do me a favor because a lot of these are going to involve the chain rule instead of X what are we going to use yeah let's use U after I have you writing them all down sorry change them all to youu so if we want to do the the uh the derivative of the sin inverse of U of course we still need to do our chain rule but here's how we do it we put 1 over theare < TK 1 - u^2 and then if we have the chain rule that's when we apply it one over the < TK of 1 - U ^2 DX for cosine now do you remember this you remember how um derivative of s is positive and derivative of cosine is negative same thing works here it's going to look identical it's just that it's negative isn't that interesting so lot of the saying properties it just it looks really weird so we'll have 1/ < TK 1 - U ^ 2 * DX but it's going to be negative tangent tan inverse we have 1 over 1 + u^2 or you could do u^2 + 1 due to the commutativity of addition DX cosecant for cose we have -1 absolute value U sare < TK u^ 2 -1 D DX now s is really related to cosecant cosine really related to secant if s was positive and cosine was negative tell me the relationship between cosecant and secant did you follow that these two are really related right so are these two these two are related so are these two so this is positive versus negative this is negative versus that's right it's going to look exactly the same just with the positive and lastly we got coent notice that coent is going to be really similar to tangent it's just the same thing only negative and those are our derivatives do you see why I say uh put these on a piece of paper have them next to you when you're doing these because they're going to be hard to memorize right off the bat and they're really similar to each other so have these down whenever you see a derivative of s u or S sin inverse U I'm sorry I misspoke sin inverse U sin inverse of 3x or something we can use this just have that formula plug in U where it's supposed to go we're going to do a couple examples right now well in a couple minutes I want to prove a couple of these uh but are you okay with the formulas right there do you have written down exactly the way I have them written down yes sir you'll make sure they're all exactly correct cuz we don't want to mess up any of these signs like1 versus positive one or have anything transposed now would you like to see why these are the way they are okay let me do a proof uh we'll prove this one and this one the others are are similar so proof of we'll do the cosine inverse well let's start off with what what cosine inverse of we'll do X but if we have cosine inverse of x equals y this happens if and only if we did this last time this happens if and only if cosine of y equal x do you remember doing that yes okay well if I've considered cosine y x these two things are they basically say the same same thing okay the one's just the inverse of the other so let's work on this one this is going to be a little bit easier for us let's take the derivative on both sides notice that this is in implicitly defined it's implicitly defined because I have y wrapped up in a function equal to X so let's do some implicit differentiation with it if I take the derivative of both sides y'all can help me with this side what's the derivative of x one perfect and the derivative of cosine y keep in mind this is implicit so Y is a function of X what would we have to do if Y is a function of X here y okay so negative sign you guys okay with the negative sin x der of cosine is not X but y y very good dydx because of whatc implicit which really that just means a change rule uh we'd have a derivative of y with respect to X because Y is a function of X that's not explicitly defined here we okay with that one well this is really easy let's just solve for this let's solve for dydx if we solve for dydx we got 1/ sin y by show hands feel okay with that so far okay now does this look anything like this yeah well we could do the negative right we can move the negative here does that look anything like that here's the problem sin y it's still not explicitly defined it's still implicit so what we want to do is we want to figure out how much sin y really is equivalent to uh so we're going to do this one of two ways we're either going to use an identity which is the way I'm going to show you or you can even use a triangle for this which is the way I'm going to show you in the next uh next process so I'm going to do two different processes on these proofs one using identity one using a triangle and show you each way notice that either of them can be done in either way so in our case we could be making a triangle right now like I'm going to do the next one but I'm going to use a really simple identity that we really should have down we should know that if I do sin y^ 2 + cosine y^ 2 it's supposed to be equal to how much that's a Pythagorean identity well tell you what Let's uh let's solve for y here if I subtract cosine S I get sin^2 y = 1 - cosine squ y you guys okay with that one we're almost there let's take a square root now here's the fun part here's the interesting part first are you guys okay on working down this this this identity okay fantastic now cosine Y how much is cosine let's look back up here how much is cosine y do you see it so this part right here use a different pen because cine y = x cosine y^ 2 is that's exactly right therefore sin y = < TK of 1 - x^2 oh that's where we're getting it from do you guys see it now so instead of sin y so this said cosine y hey cosine y was X therefore cosine y^ s cosine s y is x^2 now I have the substitution I'm going to put this right here therefore this proves that our derivative is equal to1 over < TK 1 - x^2 exactly what we have instead of U we have X but that's the whole idea sure feel okay with that would you follow that one it's not too bad right but that's why these look so weird is because since they're inverses when we change them back to original functions we do our whole derivatives well we got to change them back using that that inverse again so we're getting X's out of these because we' defin as cosine y = 2x now let's look at the the next one we'll do um let's do secant see inverse so proof for secant inverse if we have secant inverse X = Y this happens if and only if secant Y equals X well that's kind of nice we already have that we know that probably probably we're going to be substituting this back in at the very end because derivatives of secant give you back secant are you with me on this one so we know that this is true because of the definition of our inverses let's work with this guide again it's implicitly defined so we'll take a derivative with respect to X on both sides okay right hand side derivative everybody left hand side that wasn't everybody come on now left hand side derivative everybody well that was too fast I didn't even hear that wow see y tangent y very good see y tangent y yall with that yes sir okay fantastic d d i wasn't okay with that one what what are we missing here it's implicit you have to have that dydx is chain rule hey Y is a function of X so if Y is a function of X you've got to show that by the chain Rule now if we solve for dydx like the last time over here let's just divide by this therefore dydx = 1 see y tangent y are you still okay so far so use this idea okay inverses mean this for original functions we we should do the inverse uh this is defined this it can only if this no problem take a derivative implicitly that means with a chain rule you're going to have to do ydx otherwise we don't even have a a sign for our derivative that wouldn't make sense at all solve for our dydx we end up getting this now this is a problem because I've got y's and I want X's well one of these is really easy look at secant Y how much is secant y that's going to give us the X now the tangent y we got to do just a little bit more work for okay what we're going to do I'm going to draw a triangle and we're going to look at how this relates in a triangle so from here by the way I said this earlier you could have done the exact same thing with cosine yal X here's what you do uh what is my angle here x or y y is the angle what's the angle here y so Y is my Angle now if you were to think about cosine cosine would be what's cosine that's right adjacent over hypotenuse so if you don't don't write this down because I'm going to change it in a minute but just watch for a second if you were to do the cosine y = X1 cosine y would equal adjacent over hypotenuse you see it hey look at this this side is 1 - x^2 now if you took s of that angle s of that angle it's opposite over hypotenuse right there the same thing do you do you see what I'm talking about okay that's what we're going to use only now we're going to do it here did you follow that at all if not go back and watch the video next time it'll hopefully you you bet now because we're changing from cosine to secant we're have just a slightly different relationship uh secant is whatever what it's the reciprocal of cosine so it's not hypoten it's not adjacent over hypotenuse it's hypotenuse over adjacent so this would equal hypotenuse over adjacent does that make sense to you yes yes now by Pythagorean theem we can do this one really easy this will be theun of hypotenuse s minus s^ 2 x^2 - 1 are you okay with that one you can do Pythagorean theorem on your own if you want to call that side a or something uh you'd have x 1^2 + A2 = x^2 solve for a so x^2 - 1 take a square root you get this thing now what are we looking for if we try to do secant y well we already have it it's X over one that's how we got this triangle in the first place but this will allow you to find any other trigonometric relationship that's based on the angle y so if we need tangent y tan Y is what's tan again opp Opposite over adjacent but the one doesn't really matter so here we go dydx equals hey look at that that's positive 1 uh how much was secant y again now here's what we're going to do because X here is the hypotenuse a hypotenuse can't be negative it can't be even if you were to do this on your coordinate system that length is always positive to show that we put an absolute value so see see y gives us X we do absolute value X as a hypotenuse tangent well we found that tangent is the < TK of x^2 - 1 and we just proved I hope we proved it looks uh that looks right to me instead of 's we have X's but that's the prove for it uh you the only reason why you get the use in the dudx is by the chain wheel which works all the time for functions inside of functions show pant you okay with these ones it's interesting right it's a little weird but that's why we're getting these weird things it's just because of triangles it's just because of this stuff same stuff now would you like to see how to do this in practice yes probably so tell you what I'm going to move back over here because I want to keep these on the board so I'm going to these are going to be here for for basically our whole day till we get to integrals do you have any questions on the proofs okay okay okay let's see let's start with this then let's try to do the derivative of f ofx equal cosine inverse 5x now there's no need to go through all this proof over and over again these have all been proved so all we need to do is figure out which one of the six formulas we use use one of those six formulas appropriately plug in the right stuff in the right place and make sure you don't freaking forget the chain rule oh my goodness I'm strangly if well I'm sorry I'll s you your papers I'll punch your paper right in the face okay make sure make sure that you follow the chain Wheels a lot of people here go where am I getting the five from where where's that coming from why is the answer wrong in the back of the book you're wrong book no the book's right it's just you're forgetting the chain rule a lot okay it happens all the time so when we do this which one does this fit first one second 1 third 1 fourth one obviously it's cosine inverse so the way we do derivatives of cosine inverse if you want to do frime of X remember that notation it's a long time ago what this says is that well what's our u in this case yeah that's just the inside it's just a chain rule so covered up go okay this means I'm going to have -1 over there's going to be a square root there 1 minus I'm sorry what was the U again put the 5x here what do you need to do that 5x okay don't just Square the X don't put 5x s it's 5x quantity squared it's got to all be squared so this would look like this we plug it in without doing math in our head and then we do one more step after this okay so we're plugging this in we're going to have to do chain whe anyway to show that so you may as well not do this in your head sometimes you get to but for right now I want you practicing this and then we do derivative of whatever you oops U I wrote youu Whatever you just plugged in these should look the same all the time every time does that make sense okay so the derivative with respect to X of the function f is -1 over well calculus is basically done here 1 - 25 x^2 time what 5 yeah notice if you forget the chain rule you're forgetting a five so to clean this up just a little bit more we would put 5 over < TK 1 - 25x 2 that's our derivative is it straightforward enough for you guys to understand it yes since we proved these formulas I know they look weird but you can use them it's just a formula uh that's how we're doing derivatives of these inverse treat functions now of course we're going to make things a little bit more complicated more and more okay this was an easy one uh we're going to start building this stuff up little by little so let's practice some more here do you have any questions before we go on no okay all right all right let's find the derivative with respect to T of sin inverse of the Square t of 2T + 1 and you a man there lots of stuff in there well firstly identify what you're dealing with here we're dealing with an inverse trig function which means it's going to be on that list so on this list we're going to look at which one it is of course this is the very first one we had this is sign inverse so the way we go through these this the last I'm going to do for you just telling you how to do it after this I'm going to ask you some questions about it the way we go through this we first write out the formula identifying what our U is the U is always just the argument or the inside of your inverse trig function just like it is in the other ch rule so what is our U here Does it include the square root yes it does it's the whole inside of that inverse function are you guys okay with that one yeah so this is going to be let's see sign is sign positive or negative we get one we got a square root we've got a one we got a minus what do I put next 2 t + 1 and then what do I do well that's interesting isn't it so don't forget that this thing is squared it really should look like this this is why we don't do things in our head right now right now we're writing this out exactly like our formula says one one square root with the one square the one minus minus and then U okay I get U with the square and then I'm done right what do I need R it so times the derivative with respect to T make sure your variables match here of the < TK of 2 t + 1 you know what I don't like theun of 2T + 1 so I'm going to do 2T + 1 to the oh I love this stuff what do you need for that one there's man you guys you got to understand in calculus 2 we have chain RS and chain RS and all the time we're getting this stuff okay it shouldn't be hard because you did this you did train a lot in your your last class in calculus one but we're going to practice a ton of that so let's keep on going I know we got one I know we got a square root of one what happens here that okay please be careful on your algebra square root with square yes that's gone but don't do this you do that you get the problem wrong why that yes that's what we're talking about okay that that minus that's going to distribute now times let's do the derivative of 2T + 1 to the 1/2 what do we do with that bring the down sure it's our it's our chain rule it's a general power rule SO2 we got it do we do the derivative right now of this + 1 to the I wrote that poorly let me write rewrite that 1 12 like to be nice and neat here and then and then we're done all right times what derivative 2 T finally oh my goodness do we need a chain rule for this one no this is easy okay we finally got down to an easy one okay so we've got a 1 we got a square root we've got a 1 - 2 t - 1 - one we've got a you know let's start cleaning this up just a little bit let's put the one over two square root very good that moves down the denominator 2T + 1 * derivative of this whole thing is two that's two tell me some good things that happen the twos red twos are gone they simplify tell me something else that happens one's the radical look inside your square root what happens here these ones are gone that's right 1 - one is zero so we've got isn't that just T say what now isn't the two not just T it's actually -2t twos are gone we could actually make this all in one fraction if we wanted do 2T + one that's it that's our derivative can you handle it yes show hands if you can you okay with that one good deal okay now we're going to build up a little bit get to some things that are a little bit more interesting which means yes a little harder more advanced more advanced concepts question uh can you have a negative in the Square yeah but you got to keep in mind what your T can be defined as right here okay so your T would have to be negative but not so big as to make this negative so it's a really small small defined T okay good question any other questions besides that one this is probably just an algebra question you wouldn't be able to multiply those two together you actually can yeah uh you could if you because you have a square root times a square root you could do that distribute it I would leave it it's fine just like this okay moving on how about we try to conquer this one as you can see there's lots going on in this problem so let's go through it step by step to really make sure that we get it okay tell me the first thing that you're looking at here look at the Y say what now the Y the Y what do you mean the y y I think go Ln now well you know if we the Y are saying we have a function so I don't care about this one because if I do the derivative of y it's going to be dydx so the Y is okay we're okay on that side I mean on this side where all the nastiness is e the E okay so what are we going to do first we take the derivative of this or the derivative of this yeah because that's a chain rule that's going to be it's going to be like two chain rules like we had last time do you see the two chain rules I'm talking about we got chain rule because it's not just X then we've got chain rule cuz it's not just X we get two of them so Dy DX equals let's look at secant inverse so find secant inverse on your formula sheet or on the board as I've left it see inverse says we do what positive 1 or negative one so we're going to have positive one it says we do absolute value absolutely absolute value what goes inside of the absolute value yes right whatever's here argument of your inverse trig function goes there no matter what it is it doesn't matter you don't change it at all ever for this part e to the -2X and you just close it off well that's fairly easy you're just foll the formula then what do we do square root I got the square root oh man I'm going run a room square root what goes inside that's right okay so argument squ all squ make sure you get parentheses all squ and then [Music] what derivative oh yes a chain Ru derivative of what are you starting to see I know that many of you are are you starting to see how important the chain wheel is all the time starting to see how how you can't forget about it you get little pieces your your problem's blown I mean you screwed that problem up paper starts crying please No you're ruining me you've done that's just that's when I go crazy after I start grading like four test 14,000 tests oh my gosh I start making stuff up anyway so let's uh let's see if we can simplify this a little bit so we have dydx equal 1 does that change can you bring it up oh wait no never mind I how about this one can we simplify that a little bit yeah exponent raised to an exponent hello exponent raised to an exponent U so -2X * 2 gives you cool let's do this derivative now let's all do the I want you to do it on your own see if you get the right thing derivative of e2x we haven't practiced a whole bunch of those but we should be getting pretty good at them did you get the e to the -2X back yes yeah chain rule says this so dydx says all right well let's oh look at some nastiness here we got absolute value e to -2X no problem we got a s < TK e4x -1 got it we've got a e2x and then via the chain rule we got what's this one I'm going to put that in parentheses showing we're not subtracting it's a negative show H feel okay with that so far we're going to clean it up a little bit and talk about some pieces of this first first piece first piece talk about the absolute value here talk about the absolute value e to the -2X is that ever negative no so we drop the absolute value because e any base to a power no matter whether it's pos positive or negative is always positive so this is always going to be positive are you clear on that one so absolute values are gone Also let's bring this forward I've got -2 e to -2X I now have here without absolute value e -2X I've got a square otk of e4x minus one anything else we can do can you can you yeah is that being multiplied is that being multiplied did we get R the absolute value yeah you had to in order to do this by the way you had to get rid of that they're exactly the same simplify like you know what you're doing let's simplify those things so our derivative becomes actually quite nice we get -2 compar relatively ni e -4x - 1 we're done that's the whole idea so some simplification here but really the idea is use a formula don't forget the chain rule because you're going to have chain rules within chain rules within chain rules feel okay or no yes yes explain one more time why you drop the absolute value never be this is never negative think about it e e either goes ASM totic to the X as X to infinity or to the x is X approaches positive Infinity either way it's not dropping below the x-axis it's never negative so drop the absolute value you don't need it let's do one more and we're going to talk about the integrals this is about as advanced as I'm going to make it for you right here so if you can do this problem good to go I know I know that look it's nasty oh let's talk about what's going on here firstly write it down of course but then let's talk about what's going on first thing what do you see smacking you in the face question what do you see smacking you in the face right now when you see a problem two chain a function of function which means that you're going to do outside chain rule yeah First Chain rule this is a chain rule this is now the argument of cotangent you see it inside of this you have another chain rule so let's see how this thing works out this is not one time where you're going to want to do everything in your head okay uh do steps here follow the DDX in this case and see what it gives you so dydx if we're taking a derivative it says with chain rule take the derivative of the outside function leave the inside alone what's the derivative of coent remember coent is not this this isent inverse I'm not looking at this I'm looking the coent you should have in your head already good so this is cose squ of whatever this is and then am I done okay now what am I going to do chain rule with regards to just the x s or this whole thing yeah that's right so chain rule no problem derivative leave inside alone multiply by derivative of the inside that should be no brander we're okay with that okay so this equals negative cose s cosine inverse of x^2 oh goodness gracious times okay now we're going to do the derivative of cosine inverse X2 do it right now you should be good enough to do it it is a chain rule so that's the only advice I'll give you but go ahead I'm going to run the board see that you guys got the same thing on your own okay what I really want to know is did you get a -2X as well did you get a -2X somewhere did you get a2x if you did you did the chain rule appropriately if you didn't well you kind of messed something up so let's let's verify this is a cosine inverse x^2 going take a derivative of that that's this part -1/ 1 - u^ 2 did you all get that one X and Thena of the inside is 2x when we do this we get -2X 1 -4 we okay with that one y yes now this looks fine this looks fine this right here I want to look at this one a little bit we're going to talk about that for a second so let's see if we can manipulate cosine inverse of X squar using that whole triangle thing that we did before so little sidebar cosine inverse of X2 = let's call it Theta okay because what we should know about inverses is that what an inverse function equals is an angle does that make sense to you it's an inverse so this happens if and only if a triangles there if and only if cine Theta = X2 can you follow that logic yes just switch them now let's draw a triangle make that a Theta think about cosine Theta cosine is what over what please adjacent over hyp okay X2 for our adjacent one for our hypotenuse does that make sense to you yeah okay now let's fill out this let's fill out this so why don't you solve that if you can square root I'll give you the square root this squar minus this 1 - x 4 are we okay with that one now this is interesting check out what we just did so I'll I'll do a 10c recap for you just so you you see what's going on I'll real okay do the derivative down to here we probably should be right looking at this little piece cosine inverse x^2 we say okay call that an angle of a triangle no problem it has to be because it's inverse trig function this happens if and only if this is also true this is a one by the way look a t but that's a one well that means that our adjacent x^2 our hypotenuse is one we can solve for a missing side by Pythagorean theorem now think about what's going on here we just called this thinga does that make sense this angular relationship for Theta or this side relationship fora for anglea if this Isa I want to find cose OFA then Square it and make it negative so what I'm looking for now is cose are you aware that this Isa does that make sense to you that's what we call that's how we got our triangle so if this thing Isa let's just find cose cose Theta cosecant comes from s so if cosecant comes from s the reciprocal of sign hypotenuse over hypotenuse over opposite I want show Answer be okay with that one it's a little weird right we're using a triangle to our advantage though we're saying yeah sign would be this over this therefore Co cosecant is this over this no problems you see how to use that it's kind of cool right use the inside to make up triangle then finding cose of that angle of your triangle that you just found it's awesome now we don't really want cosecant Theta itself we want cosecant squar and then we're going to make it negative so if I want cose squet all I have to do is square the numerator and denominator that means I get 1 over 1 - x 4th because if I Square this I Square this one and then Square Root's gone are we okay with that one yeah last step if I want this to be negative put a negative so negative cose gives you1 over 1 - x 4 now let's put all of this crap together this piece from our triangle is 1/ 1 - x 4 this piece that's easy this is -2X over < TK 1 - x 4 you ready for some Fancy Pants math a little bit Fancy Pants math you ready do okay when you have x to the 1st * x to the 12 we get x to the 3 agreed yeah as we add that's what we're going to do here this is to the first Power this is to the 1/2 power therefore when we multiply we're going to get a POS 2X and we're going to get 1 - x 4 to the 3 half power and that's it that's as simple as we can make that one what I'm really concerned about is that you can get down to here as far as your derivatives did you understand that yeah and I'm also concerned about cuz we're going to use a lot we're going to use this a lot this idea of making a triangle and using a triangle did you follow that it's interesting though isn't it it's a little bit bizarre because maybe some of you hadn't done that before but you see that it's possible hello yes no yeah you sure all right let's talk about one more we move on to integrals and I'll wipe off the whole board here so on the test this is what I want want it all the way down yep so we have to you got to know you got to do that so maybe behoove you to uh practice this a couple times really come by and see me if you need to watch the video again practice that a few times get in the triangle on your own okay don't just follow my notes do it on your own okay one more uh we'll talk about this if I ask you to do the derivative of tan inverse X Plus xent inverse X could you do it could can you take the derivative do you have to do this all at once or can you do this piece this piece that piece and that good we can separate by addition that's fantastic can you do the derivative of tan inverse X yeah that's really easy actually no chain rule at all what would you have to do for this derivative R good this one would be easy this one you have it right on your formula so be aware of things like that and we should be good to go do you guys feel okay with our derivatives yeah okay now I want you to notice something here look back at our derivatives do you see that there's really only three different types of derivatives and the other three are just negatives of them yeah identical just negative identical just negative identical just negative what that means is that we really only need three new pieces of our integration table what we're going to do is we're going to take this one we're going to take this one and we're going to take this one so we're going to be able to find the integrals of here here and here because if they were negative you just pull them in front of your integral anyway wouldn't you I would so here's our new integration table we only need three because the other three are are negatives of the rest let's say we have an integral and we can make it 1 over < TK 1 - u^2 D what are we going to get out of that let's find it which one's it like that's that's well not quite inverse sin inverse u+ see that's exactly right what are you going to have to do a lot in these next problems do you think you're to substitute like Mad Dogs all the time substitute substitute substitute hold time okay how about we do 1 over 1 + U ^2 U what are we going to get out of that integral if we can make it look like 1 1 + U ^2 it's going to become tan inverse if der of tan inverse gives you this the integral of this gives you tan inverse now because we we get a small difference between between this and this I want to show you that when we do one over this this doesn't look exactly like this one but it doesn't matter because of the domain of the seant inverse what happens here is we don't actually have to have the absolute value but we do get them in our secant like that just be it's a domain issue are we okay with those three so if we get something look like this gu sin inverse something looked like this tan inverse something look like this because it's just like that one we're going to see inverse if you had negatives check this out yes you could call that what be cosecant inverse but for us we just pull the negative outside call it negative see inverse that's the whole idea should we try some sure I'd like to I'd like to do it right now and not next time just so it's really fresh in our heads this whole idea a t will start out really easy and gradually build up to where it's harder you mean more fun more fun yeah now of course what I've told you is that if it doesn't look exactly like something in your integration table which you've just added to right now with three new integrals it doesn't look like that what do you need for it so we're going to have to do a substitution here's the idea your goal is to try to try to make this thing a one minus something squared so for us one idea would be let's leave the square root we'll leave the one cuz that's great but you need to write this as something squared and then make a substitution so instead of 16 x^2 I don't like that I want want something squared cuz that little something there that's what we're going to call the U that's why it's defined as a u over here what's going to be in [Music] there yeah that's exactly right and now a substitution is just so nice don't forget the substitution here but if we do U = 4X then du = 4 DX or du over 4al DX notice what I'm not doing you looking notice what I'm not doing I'm not doing a whole substitution right here if I tried to do that I would get an X do you see any other X's up here be stuck so we have to have these inverse trick functions to be able to do some of these integrals it's really interesting we can't do this any other way than what we what we have with our inverses here this is the integral so we have this we got okay well no no let's make it work so let's call that says 16x2 4X squ do a little substitution are you guys okay with the substitution yeah now we still have the one we still have the square root we still have this one we still have the minus but how much is this now and that's exactly what we want to see and instead of DX we have what and then good D over4 and then sure with the with the over four let's make that 1/4 so 1/4 integral 1 overare < TK 1 - u^2 hey look at that that's what substitution does for us it makes things fit so if this fits which one does this fit is this the sign inverse the tangent inverse or the secant inverse so this says we're going to have 1/4 s inverse U plus C if you want to right now which equals 1/4 sin inverse why am I not stopping at sin inverse U why am I not doing that started with x's right we want to end with x's so instead of sin inverse U we're going to have s inverse of what that's right that my friends the whole idea let's start one more make as much progress as we can and then we'll call it good check out this one integral of 1 < tk25 - x^2 DX does this look like this no so we're going to have to do a substitution but I want to show you this one because this happens um some some books some formulas are actually allow for for this case and they'll show you a a different integral table for this I'm a simple guy I'm a simple man so what I like to do is I like to make it fit perfectly and how you can do this just just watch along how you can do this is force this to factor Force this to be a factor and do something like this instead of 25 - x^2 do 25 * 1 - x^2 over 25 do you see that we can force that to be a factor that way just divide out the 25 if you distribute you'll notice this 25 - x^2 the 25s would go away does that make sense hello yes no now what this allows you to do is break up this square root so we're going to do two steps here we're going to do one over well here's the square root of 25 how much is the square root of 25 that's great times the square root don't forget about that second square root you're breaking this out by a product 1 minus and I'm also going to make this into a square so instead of x^2 over 25 I'm going to think about this as something squared what is it x x over 5 would work great so little recap we've got no I don't like 25 I want to make that one I want to make it one so that it fits my integration table so I'm making this into a one by forcing it to factor forcing the 25 to factor out are you following me on that one yeah yes no do you see that it is the same thing yeah separate your square roots get rid of that number get rid of that square root of 25 whatever whatever constant you have factored out smooth that out even if it's not even a perfect square you can still do this it's just awkward it's a little looks a little worse oh it's a constant constant yeah now square root of it well no I don't like x^2 - 25 I need something squared so I can make a substitution you follow yeah okay so what we do we say all right how much is our our U going to be uh X if we have X over 5 then duu = 15 DX and 5 du = DX almost done stick with me okay I got to wrap things up so here's one how much is square of 25 everybody so we got a five here I've got a square root inside my square root please tell me inside my square root what do I got 1- and instead of DX I have oh no it's not look what happens a lot of the times this happens here do you see what happens FES are gone that's awesome fives are gone we have the integral of 1 over 1 < TK of 1 - U how much is the integral of 1un of 1 - ^2 sign that's on your table so this would be sin inverse U + C or wrapping it up sin inverse of let's do our substitution again x 5 plus c did that one make sense to you oh yeah so even if it doesn't quite work with a one factor the constant out make it Factor if it factors you can get rid of that constant square root of whatever number you have pull it out front often times what happens is when you substitute back in this number will match up with that number a lot of the times you can cross it out and then just do a very basic intergal so last time we learned all about the integrals that give us some of these inverse trig functions we got a couple more examples and then we'll be done with our section so let's look at the integral of e x over e 2x + 1 now on first glance you might be thinking well let's just use a basic substitution and be done with this thing let's take a look at that is a substitution going to work for this what do you think if I substitute for this if I make that a u is this going to get rid of that if I make this a u is this going to get rid of that no yeah yeah I'd have something else though two so I I get this back again do you guys see that yeah so no not quite that would be kind of an issue here so what we're going to do instead is we're going to try to rewrite this to make it fit one of these things do you remember doing that when it doesn't when it doesn't fit your integration table exactly like that we're going to rewrite it we're going to try to make it fit something here's what I'm seeing uh the reason why this is for me this is noticeable is okay I see a plus one I like plus one I see something being squared do you see what I'm talking about something being squared so instead of doing just a regular substitution we're going to make it so that when we substitute yeah it's going to be a substitution but when we substitute it's going to fit one of these things so let's break this down a little bit so yeah this is this isn't e to the 2x this is e to the X yeah we can do that because when we take exponent to exponent we m multiply therefore 2x as an exponent becomes X and then squ you guys okay with that one so far yeah now check it out when we go through and do do our substitution let's substitute for the appropriate thing what is our substitution here wait the whole thing or just this thing just this thing why we're doing just this thing is because we want to make it fit that thing well that's going to be kind of nice if I take the derivative of that what's the derivative of e to X please and D oh look at that this is this we can just do a straight substitution so our integral becomes tell me what it is what's on the numerator of my integral yeah or or what could you put put du if you really want to do that what's on the denominator and then yeah don't forget you have to match up your ver this is not relev this why your your Calculus one teacher made you put du or DX or D whatever you have to match that up show hands be okay with that so far does it fit now a piece of cake now which which one is this tan inverse U is what that is it looks exactly the same it's only well a distance commutative no big deal but looks exactly the same plus C if you want to right now or later tan inverse what one thing we have to do though we have to substitute this back in E to X plus C we feel okay with that your fans if you feel not not so bad awesome so bad not so bad not so bad not so bad any questions on that one no these become pretty easy when you know what you're looking for for instance I know I'm dealing in a section that has inverse streat functions hello I'm going to try to make it like one of these when you're not when you're just doing problems on your own like I give you on a test might be a little more difficult so you really do need to practice looking at these problems identifying man what am I going to do with this thing try to make it fit have your integration table next to you be looking at it going well how does this best fit if a substitution doesn't work right away try something else don't force it if it's not working okay question so you're able to do that because the exponential right CU that's like just saying two * x e 2x is e x^2 that's that's that's how I'm looking at that okay last one let's look at it does it look anything like anything in our integration table kind of kind of well it's got a square root right so it's not this it's either this one or this one let's see if a substitution would work how about this one look at this what a substitution work yeah if the X was here absolutely yes do you see why yeah the derivative is 18x do you see that X's would go away if the X is not here if the x is here oh wait a minute that's sorry my bad that's 1 /x no the derivative of this is not 1 /x does that make sense to you the derivative of sub substitution has to be there if it's not then it will not work so let's try to manipulate this thing into looking like one of these so uh what's your first idea what do you want to do to look something very good because we like the square root don't we we're not going to change that we don't like the 9x2 we like the minus one don't we do you guys see that we like that one what we don't like is the fact that this is not something being squared so change it to something being s and someone said it already what is it that already looks a little bit better but does it fit exactly our Paradigm for for this over here not yet yeah good substitution so let's do that if we do a substitution uh please watch carefully because something kind of interesting happens here when we do a substitution for 3x yeah du = 3 DX or du over 3 = DX you guys okay with that one on the numerator we got one on the denominator be careful what do we have oh before that did we take care of that x no that's a problem so X do we still have a square root yeah what's inside and then instead of DX we have perfect show hands feel okay with that so far so same idea as last time we're saying no no no I don't like that I'm trying to make it fit try to make it fit one of these things since I see a variable outside it's not this one it's not this one because that doesn't have square root it's mostly like this one we're going to try to F make it fit this one now here's the issue this looks really good I did my substitution I've already done done away with the DX I've already done away with the 3x I got a u^2 - 1 that looks perfect I've got a du this is the problem do you see your variables have to match here they all got to be the same so one thing that you can do use your substitution again I'll say it again use your substitution again so for instance If U equals 3 please listen and watch carefully If U = 3x that also means that X = U over 3 does that make sense to you ah can you now get rid of the X Okay so 1 x no no no no no you can't have this so use your substitution again one over I'm going to draw it in purple that way you can see what I'm doing here this x check it out this x is u over3 u over 3 well the u^2 minus one was great D over3 no big deal so the idea again first are you okay with doing the first step are you okay that we're picking 3x as our substitution kind of have to right if we do that then we can also make X just solve for x x now equals U over3 that allows you later to change any variables extraneous variables that aren't used into use so X now becomes U over3 no big deal now it fits tell me what happens with our threes they're gone they're gone this is over three this is like over over three ha so we you can reciprocate that up this actually moves through the numerator that's denominator they're gone well this is pretty easy then this integral now becomes 1 / U < TK U ^2 - 1 du I need a quick head not if you're okay with with that so far does it make sense it's interesting right it's a little bit tricky because you got to do something that X you can't leave it so use your substitution again no big deal now does that fit our our integral model perfectly how much is it absolute value U plus C very good and of course we never leave that we're going to have secant inverse absolute value what's in there that ladies and gentlemen is the correct integration should F be okay with what we've talked about that basically wraps it up uh that wraps up this section so what I'm expecting from you is that you're able to find these type of integrals nothing super super super crazy right now yeah they're going be a little bit harder on your homework some of them some a lot of them will be just like this I really just want to make sure that you're you're getting used to the idea of substituting to make it fit your integration table we just now have three new integrals that we can work with any questions or comments or do you feel good about it good just want 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 6.6:  A Discussion of Hyperbolic Functions
now what we're doing we're going to get on to a really interesting section uh what we're going to talk about is something called hyperbolic functions this is section 6.6 some instructors cover this some instructors choose to kind of gloss over it we're going to cover it because I think it's really interesting it's really useful so we're going to talk about hyperbolic functions you go what in the world is a hyperbolic function uh I want to show them to you right now the hyperbolic functions the reason why they're in this chapter in this this section here right after inverses is because hyperbolic functions look they don't look a lot like but they act a lot like trig functions so we call them hyperbolic trig functions sometimes let me give you an example what these things are here's the definitions for your hyperbolic functions so we start with sign to say that it's hyperbolic we just introduce a little H some people call this cinch say cinch cuz it's so easy CCH it's a CCH I know right I have a possibly the largest D you've ever seen so s hyperbolic sign here's the definition of it it's weird it is e xus e x / 2 what's really interesting about these things um you ever notice how when you drive next to like electric electric wires how they they curve like that it's called a catary uh they're actually based on hyperbolic functions so the way that a cable hangs between two points is based on some of this stuff really weird it actually happens in real life for engineering all the time so this is cinch or hyperbolic sign hyperbolic cosine K Kush looks really really similar really really similar the rest of the hyperbolic functions stem from these two so um really quickly if you wanted hyperbolic tangent no special name no tant or anything like that doesn't really sound good anyway just hyperbolic tangent hey now this is what's cool about this a lot of the same properties of trig functions carry over to hyperbolic function so whereas tangent equals s over cosine hyperic tangent equals c over C so this would equal hyic sign over hyperbolic cosine that's interesting imagine this over this and that is is what hyic tangent is I did it twice in a row come on let draw s Intrigue functions cosecant is one over s hyperbolic hyperbolic cosecant is one over inch that's right holic sign looks very similar same thing happens second this is now one over C and if tangent hyperbolic tangent equals cinch over Kos then hyperbolic Cent is yep it is the reciprocal it's okay with those those properties those are the definitions that we work with in these hyperbolic functions now I'm going to give you some identities the identities look really similar to the basic trig identities that you have but there's slight differences um so write these down have them next to you when you're doing your homework that way you can refer back to them okay so write these down and I don't expect you to memorize all of them U some of them you're going to because they're just so similar uh to the other ones but some differ just slightly okay so here's the identities that we're going to use hyperbolic sign if I plug in a Negative X it gives me now negative hyperbolic sign what this is saying and you can write this down next to it this is saying that just like s is an odd function you remember odd odd is symmetrical about the origin just like s is an odd function hyperbolic sign is also an odd function that's what this says basically the says a odd function now C think back to cosine is cosine even or odd even it's actually even because it's symmetric across the y- axis Kos gives you Kos when I plug in negative actually gives you back the positive that's saying this is an even function if you need to look up odd or even go ahead and look up what odd and even means later those are two identity spores now this is where some of the differences happen the Pythagorean identity for trigonometric functions what would go here to give us one A Plus would go there for hyperbolic it's a minus this is why I'm telling you have these next to your paper when you're doing it CU right now these are brand new okay it's a little bit different they're all hyperbolic so they're a little different also another one another Pythagorean that one it's also true I'm just going to State the rest of them some of them are going to look really familiar to you I hope they do they're on those those cheat sheets that I know a lot of you have when you in the back of your book or whatever all the the trig identities that you carry with you it's good thing for this one's kind of an important one this will look familiar to you remember this one it's called the double angle U if you had this basic old sign without the without the hyperbolic this would be equal to do you remember it 2 this be two sin cosine well same thing happens here it's two cinch gosh that's kind of cool that looks really similar in fact I'm going to prove this one for you in just a bit okay I swear this is it I'm tired of riding too arms were out already okay I know that's a lot of them but for those of you who are familiar with your trig identities don't a lot of those look really really similar to what you've learned yeah a lot of them are very very very close I mean this one exactly the same these ones close these ones exactly the same I mean they're they're all so so close well what I'm going to do now we're not going to you're not going to be required to do all of these proofs but I want to give you an idea about how you would prove one of these so let's take a look at uh which one I say that one let take a look at that one I'll prove that for you so we're going to prove number seven the way that you prove these I know you still writing some of you but the way you prove these you start here on the left side or start on one side and prove the other side okay you don't do them both at once you start on one side and work to the other so if I start with cinch of 2x okay follow me along here the only thing we have to work with as far as proofs go are other identities which probably not a good idea right now since we haven't proved any of them or these definitions and these are the only two definitions that we have that go back to e to the X so let's see what this would be please please listen very carefully I don't want to lose you right now if c x = e xus e tox since 2x would be e to 2x - e - 2x does that make sense whatever you have here is whatever you plug in there so then this equals e 2x minus E -2X all over 2 does that make sense let's rewrite it just a little bit I'm going to rewrite this as e to x s is that still legal to do yesus e tox SAR over two you okay with that one that my friends is a difference of squares do you see it yes no difference of squares can be factored so if we factor that this is e to xus e x * e X+ e x over two you still okay so far now do those look similar to some of these other definitions I'll make it okay I'll do one more Stu see by the blank looks on your faces that no the answer is no some of them don't check this out what if I did E to x minus E thex / 2 * e x + e x X look back at our definition for this please how much is this this is hyperbolic sign or cinch is this C where's the two where's the two so we're going to make a two do you agree that I can multiply by whatever I want as long as I multiply by one it doesn't change it so I'm going to multiply by 2 over two only I'm going to put this two here and this two out front did you catch that yeah this one goes here this one goes out front it's very similar to your identities that you did with sin x overx when X approaches zero and you had like s of 5x overx multiply by 5 over five and you get five so I multiply by 2 over two it's still one but now we have two this is cinch this is C and we've just proved it so on some of your homeworks are going to ask you to do these go back to these definitions and use them none of some of them are are pretty easy pretty straightforward this one's pretty straightforward did that make sense to you it's different from anything you probably ever done show fans if you understood it feel okay with it good that's fantastic Okay so we've proved it and that's not a problem now that we've done that what I'd like to cover are the derivatives we're going to do derivatives we're going to do the integrals um then we'll start working through some of these examples and and call it good do you have any questions on your identities I'll be referencing them uh but we won't we're not going to do a whole bunch of them today I just wanted to prove them for you you will be using them in your derivatives and integrals any questions all because I got to erase it okay let's talk about your derivatives I'd like to give you the first three just by some very simple proofs that way you understand where these things are coming from uh tell me something first though what's the derivative of s just sign okay what's the derivative of cosine very good and the derivative of tangent we're going to see if there's any differences with these things so let's start off with the derivative of cinch how do you know is coach are we guessing we're guessing I looked in the book already uh well let's go back to what the identities say okay we we'll prove it so if I'm going to do this keep in mind that what this is this is the derivative I'm going to Der very quick right now to prove these okay this would be the Der of e xus e x over two so we're going back to the definition you guys okay with that derivative of e remember this two you do not need a quo rule here it's a constant so Dera of e x is e x minus the derivative of this is e tox times1 see where netive 1's coming from that negative would change us to a plus this is yes the derivative of cinch is C isn't that kind of cool do you guys see the proof out of that one yeah interesting okay so how about we do now this one's going to blow your mind maybe this would be the derivative of e to x + e x / 2 check this one out firstly notice that is C what's the Dera of e to x d of e x e time so so negative e to thex over 2 how much is that cin not negative it's just cinch do you see it so this one just like regular trick functions this one not so much cuz we the negative but still the idea is very simar question can you one time why that to the constant you don't if I see that I automatic well you shouldn't because it's not a function of X over a function of X it's a function of X over constant if you did quotient rule hey everybody what's a derivative of two Z undefined half your no not undefined half your quotient is gone you just you're it's low D high right minus high D low d low the second half of your quotient is zero why would you do that now now that I just said you don't need a quoti rule okay so from our definition we know that this is equal to now if I could write it correctly yeah do we need a quotient rule here yeah we do we do because well this is a function of X over function of X that's different okay now here's the nice thing about this because we just proved these two derivatives we can use them we don't have to change into these we just proved it do you got me so all we need is quotient Rule now I'm going to do the quoti rule really quickly quotient rule says low d d High which is C does that make sense low D High minus high D L Square the bottom and away we go so low D High minus high D low Square the bottom and we're good to go oh let's see that's uh that's cos 2 x minus cinch s x all over cos s x look back at those identities I told you to have next to you at all times can you tell me how much this is 1 over cos 2 x now can you just bring it up now look back at that look back at your identities again your definitions one over Co one over Kos that's hard to say it is hard to say one over Kos was hyperbolic SN does that make sense so 1 s is hyperbolic syn squ so the derivative of tangent hyperbolic tangent is hyperbolic secant squ does that look similar to your triat functions Che a lot of them are going to I'm going to give you the list right now of all these things and I'm going to likewise give you the integrals right next to them we'll do that over here this will need little cheat thing yes so here's your table your new table of more derivatives and more integrals the table's getting pretty long now isn't it yeah table of D's and eyes derivative and integral please keep in mind what can happen every time you do a derivative what can happen always always looking for chain rules okay so still chain rules exist so if I'm talking since you then that's going to be C you C darn you get it uh do you d x by the chain rule what that means is that going backwards the integral of c u duu would equal what if the Der of cinch gives you cost integral of cost you just cinch what's nice about HP BS you have no negatives to worry about care there are none in cin and caution at least that's good to go that's kind of nice derivative of costu we just found it out was CCH U DX by the chain rule therefore the integral of cchu is what please that's right thanks we already did tangent over here if we do hyperbolic tangent then our derivative is good which means if I ever get the opportunity to make a hyperbolic secant squar then we end up getting hyperbolic tangent plus C are you guys okay with these so far the first three we've actually done already this the last three they are going to look so similar to the things that you've done of course some signs can be different because that's we find out with found out with s and cosine that well the derivative of of Kos is not negative sign it's just it's cinch so some of the same thing happened here when we did cosecant when we did derivative cose you got negative cosecant Cent correct same thing we get here so when do h cose we get netive hyperbolic cose times hyperbolic cang DX which means that our integral of hyperbolic cosecant Cent that's right this is what we typically do with our our integrals we usually don't have the negative in here we just say the the answer our our resultant is going to be negative which one am I missing okay see let's do see the derivative of a regular secant is secant tangent the derivative of hyperbolic secant is hyperbolic secant hyperbolic tangent but it's negative notice how some of the signs change which means that if I have a hyperbolic secant and hyperbolic tangent we're going to get Negative hyperbolic seant okay one more I swear I know it's dry I really do we're going to practice something just a bit if you know this is dry what's the last one what one is that normally what is the negative cosecant squ so when we do hyperbolic cotangent we end up do the same thing we get Negative hyperbolic cose squ it's hard to say isn't it there's so many hyperbolic in there and stuff so negative hyperbolic cose s of course d DX by our chain rule which means when we get an integral with the hyperbolic cosecant in there hyperbolic cosecant squ in there we know that that's going to be equal to negative hyper Cent Oh My Gosh okay that's it thankfully do yourself favor keep these handy keep your identities and your deriv and integrals on the same little piece of paper and keep them handy all the time okay cuz we're going to be using them not a whole bunch like I said uh a lot of this book doesn't depend on this section it's kind of a little Standalone section uh but it's a good section it is important in in real life I mean this this stuff does happen so I wanted you to be aware of it uh now we're going to practice what we're going to find out is that your derivatives and your integrals it really doesn't change from all the stuff that youve just learned how to do it's going to be a lot of chain rules it's going to be a lot of substitutions you're just trying to make them fit now there's just more stuff that you can fit it into does that make sense to you you don't have to make everything look like this to take a derivative now that we have all these we get to use them so that's cool and all this is what they are but we get to use this stuff which is nice you want to see some examples of this sure okay so so we are actually going to do a lot of derivatives let's do that okay so cos S 3 T ^2 + 1 is the argument of our hyperbolic Co cosine function uh tell me some first some things that you see here tell you what this is oh never mind I can't say that joke um anyway in this class it's kind of like in uh in math C or your intermediate algebra class when the teacher asks you what do you do here and you and 90% of the time you just have to say factor and you get it right uh here if I ask you what are you going to do here 90% of time you say uh chain rule yeah you're going to get right okay there's always going to be a chain rule involved so if you don't know the answer just say chain rule you look like a genius you couldn't do a subtitution here are you doing integrals yeah then you would not probably not want to do a substitution technically a chain rule is a substitution just don't show it you substitute for U you do it you do DX okay but that's the the substitution is the opposite of a chain rule okie dokie it's for integrals does that make sense now I see a chain rule in fact I see two chain two you need to know that hyperbolic cosine squared this means it's this squar that's what that means did you know that that that little two right there it's the whole thing is being raised to the second power it's we write it this to make it easier so with our derivative tell me the first thing we're going to do please quickly though I know it's chain Ru thank you for following my advice right now just yelling it out goad two to the front okay very good so two to the front do we change the inside on chain roll so this is going to be nasty this is going to be C of nasty crap raised to what power now and then we're done right no no we don't get off that easy so we bring down the two leave it alone subtract one now we do a derivative you know what I made a mistake did you catch my mistake this should be a t my apologies shame on Mr Leonard so bring down the two chain rule just general power rule if you know it by that name bring down the two subtract one keep the inside the same then you multiply by the derivative of yep the inside of that of them in one okay so now we have this one what is the follow the DDT the DDT tells you where you're doing calculus here calculus said just do the big thing first chain roll okay okay now we got that now do this thing what does that say I know what it says what are you going to do derivative of this so that's going to be negative C or positive right very good so oh yeah do you do the derive of this right now NOP no no chain rule says you leave that alone and then you do the derivative of the inside later oh my goodness let's do a 10c recap make sure you're okay with it does it look does it look any different than your normal derivatives it's just a slightly different idea because you're not dealing with trig you're dealing with hyperbolic functions so bring down the two no problem it's chain Ru D of this that's essentially the inside alone derivative of the inside we're almost done derivative of this is so this becomes 6t let's just rewrite it so what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull this 6 T out front mash it together with this two is this okay with you so we're going to get 12T we are going to get C 3T ^2 + 1 time c 3 T ^2 + 1 make it that far you're good to go show F you okay with that one notice how the derivative ideas the chain rules they don't differ they're the same it's just that we have some different derivatives that we're dealing with you okay with that one tell you what let's uh I'm going to try to get to two more we'll see if we have time for that actually you want to try one just on your own sure I think you can do it oh yeah I want hyperbolic coent of hyperbolic cosecant of 2x yes I'm going to give you enough time as I erase this side of the board and then we're going to go for it actually let your dribs are up there so I'll leave it for this one did you do the first step already M thank you what is your first step what's the answer 90% of the time this question at least when you're dealing with derivatives yeah we're going do a chain Ru do you guys see the chain rule inside of the chain rule yeah this has of course a chain rule this has another chain rule so when we do it well it says take the derivative of the outside function if I look over there I see it's negative Co hyperbolic cose square of the inside so I'm going to leave this alone did you make it that far derivative of this is this leave the inside alone it's chain rule but then don't forget to multiply by the derivative of the inside so chain rule says derivative of outside function leave inside alone then multiply derivative of the inside function thankfully for us that's a really easy chain rule that's nice what's the Der of this cinch 2X and then time derivative 2x so we're going to get a two out of that okay derivative so this is done we did derivative outside leave inside alone times der inside we got this we're following the DDX here now chain rule again derivative outside is leave the inside alone times the derivative of the inside that's where we're getting that two from you guys okay with that one match all this stuff together if you can the two let's put that up front so -2 hyperbolic cose squ of 2x cinch 2x let's make sure we know that these are arguments of our hyperbolic functions take your the mouth it's crazy show F feel okay with that one good all right tell you what we got time for one more and next time just to blow your minds um we're going to talk about inverse hyperbolic functions all right but not this time not this time wor I know right oh my gosh got through this uh let's try let's see which ones I'm going to erase all this CU we're going to do an integral oh don't worry we're doing integrals so we'll need this stuff how would you say that H yeah our cost or hyperbolic cosine inverse inverse it's super fun to say makes you sound real smart it does yeah imagine if you would have seen this the first day of class huh I would true more okay we're going to work through it together together I'll give you some hints on this one I don't have enough time to really have you work on it but I'm going to show you some of the the ideas here one of the ideas is none of these things have a 3X in them they'll have U's or you can just make it an X just a single variable so anytime you see an argument with like a 3X 3X 5x 5x uh X2 X x s with an X out front just substitute do a very quick substitution to get rid of the 3x so what I mean is we would do U = 3x so then we'd have du over 3 = DX or the 3 goes up front whatever you want to say there so we get cos 2 U cinch U and then du over 3 does that make sense to you yeah don't put uh but we have the the over three we'll just pull that 1/3 out front now we can deal with this a little bit better so basic basic substitution remember you can substitute as long as you match up disregarding your constants so if the derivative is three man you're good to go get 3x pull this out front we get 1/3 integral cos^2 U Since U now does this look exactly like one of these then what are you going to have to use identi identi not identities what do you use in integrals when it doesn't look exactly the same you use substitution so this going to be a double substitution here okay well think about think about that you have to don't you don't you have to it doesn't look anything like that there's no identity that lets you put these together in any fashion so you need a substitution now substitutions work this way listen carefully please substitutions work this way the substitution is typically the inside of something and the derivative has to be there so let's look at the correct choice is this the correct choice for substitution no cost would be there but not cost squared that's a problem is this the correct substitution with the squared or without good it's the inside so what we're going to do here is we're going to pick pick a different letter like w and pick that for Posh U make sure your DW matches your W what's the derivative of c [Music] u c u hey look at this this is exactly this thing so when we change this I'm going to have 13 please watch carefully this was c u 2 I sub super Cost U what goes here W very good that's W2 this is W so now we have W squ you guys okay with that one that's gone now what happens to all of this stuff what is that these have to match now look at that can you do that integral that is an absolute piece of cake this is going to be 13 W cubed over 3 we haven't done one of those in a really long time have we I forgot about those we trig stuff you guys okay with that add one divide by the new exponent yeah so w 3 3 that means we get W 3 over 9 and then we leave it like that everything everything so so here's the here's the deal if we've got W Cub over 9 what is our W so then here we've got C wait a minute C 3 you can put one of two things you U or you can do the 3x I'm going to put the U so I give myself two steps here over 9 uh do I have it right no what am I missing so this was our W if we have W cubed We need c cubed of U over 9 and now last little step I'm going to erase this here last little step to make it final we're going to have cubed instead of our U what was our U over 9 plus C wrap it up did that make sense to you yeah so you can do a sub a double substitution just pick a different letter but you'll see it's the same stuff you've been doing really is same derivatives same same integrals it's just we have a new integration and derivative table so if hand feel okay with with that one okay obviously all right so last time we talked about hyperbolic functions now if you think about hyperbolic functions I know I didn't show you the graphs of them but you can look them up uh is actually in your book it's a one: one function they're all one: one functions which mean that if we have a one: one function there has to be some sort of an inverse to it so what we're talking about today are okay hyper bolics are 1: one we're going to talk about inverse hyperbolic here's the notation for it it's just like any other inverse we have hey hyperbolic function now inverse all these are holic inverses of the normal holic functions that we talked about last time I've given you the domain for each of them you can go ahead and write that down like I said we're not going to work a whole bunch with this stuff but I want you to be aware that they exist obviously they have to because they're coming from one to one functions now what I'm going to talk about specifically here is what they look like as logarithms you're like wait a minute as logarithms well think back to what hyperbolic are hyperbolic sign was was e xus e x over 2 you with me now what's the inverse of e to X log it's a log it's lnx actually does that make sense to you so if the inverse of edx and exponential is a logarithm Ln X for instance well then the inverses of hyperbolic because they they're all based on exponentials like e xus e x / 2 and E X Plus e x / 2 because they're based on those well then we can write these inverses also as logarithms I'm going to show you that right now so here's how these things look as logarithms these are definitions you can take them for granted so if we want to write s hyperbolic sign inverse you could also write it as Ln x + square < TK of X2 + 1 wherever you see this it means this wherever you see this you can actually write it as this they're the same thing their definition now tan hyperbolic tan inverse you can write that as 12 Ln 1 + x over 1 - x and last we only knew three because the other ones you can find as reciprocals of these three so it's kind of easiest to Define these three okay the last one well this one's going to look a whole lot like uh C inverse so this is C inverse would be Ln x + S < TK instead of x^2 + one we're going to have x^2 minus one just the difference of one little sign in there please write those down correctly make sure you have them exactly the way that I have them on the board I don't want you to write these down and then write them down correctly and then use it wrong for the whole class okay you guys okay with this so far do you want to see a proof yes I'm not going to prove all three I'll prove uh these two are very similar so I'll prove this one that way you get another one basically for free so here's a proof for this um let's start with cos inverse X and let's have it equal to let's say y well from what we know about inverses I'm going to go through this a little bit quickly but write it down if you want to you don't have to to memorize this proof uh just kind of I want you to follow it all right so if I'm going too fast for you to write down just review the video later or don't don't really worry about it I just want you to be a be aware of it uh understand where this thing comes from you guys with me so here we go if this is true then this has to be true true sure that's that's kind of the definition of inverses right C inverse of xal Y if only have c y equals equals x well let's use the definition then for c c y if you remember this from here I'm going to switch these sides okay then X would equal instead of c y the definition of c y is e to X+ e x over 2 do you remember that that's how I I initially gave you these things oh you know what I made one mistake did you see the mistake I actually made it the Y instead X's I do this all the time because we memorize it as X but if I'm going to say this is Kos y then this has to be Y and this has to be y did you guys catch that one okay now since we have xal well let's uh remember we're not we're not actually doing derivatives here this is just a we're not doing derives at all I didn't say the derivative of this equals this did you notice that it's not derivative not calculus I'm saying this literally equals this so we're not going to do any calculus at all we're basically going to do some algebraic manipulation trying to solve this thing for y if we can solve this thing for y look at the board here real quick if we can solve this for Y and Y equals this then we'll have an expression in terms of X that represents C inverse does that make sense to you so no calculus no derivatives nothing like that we're just solving this well one idea that we're going to do here we're going to say all right well this is cool uh what if we just multiply both sides by two then we get 2x = e y y plus e y all right now I'm going to do something uh do something here CU I'm going to manipulate this function a little bit or this equation I'm going to solve this for zero so I'm going to subtract 2x on both sides so I'm going to get 0 = e y - 2x + e y you guys okay with that so far now I'm going to do some Fancy Pants math the Fancy Pants math here is is this I don't like I don't like this negative y I don't like either negative y so what I'm going to do to get rid of this I'm going to multiply both sides of an equation keep in mind it's an equation I can do whatever I want as long as I do it to both sides I'm going to multiply both sides by E to Y if that's the case e y * 0 is still zero only here this e to the Y will distribute check this out I'm going to get watch e to the Y Y 2 you see it I'm actually going to keep it this way e y 2 I'm going to get - 2x e the y - 2x I'm also going to write this a little bit specially I'm going to keep this in parentheses you'll see Y in a second minus E Y and then oh look at this if I have e to y * e y that's going to create e to the0 or 1 plus one so feel okay with that one so far so we're just Distributing we got zero here we've got e to the y^ 2 we've got - 2x e y we've got + one because e y * e y gives you e 0 that's one so far so good yeah now look at this carefully this is kind of cool this is actually a quadratic do you see it where a the coefficients a is one B is is -2X I know it's weird but we're going to use an X here and C is 1 you with me so what we know from the quadratic formula is whatever my I'm going to treat this thing like my variable you can use a substitution and say hey let's make = e x or sorry e y in this case then you'd have U ^2 - 2x U + 1 you guys see that and we'd have U equal to whatever my quadratic is I'm going to eliminate that step I'm just going to say okay well because e to the Y is what my my term is I'm just going to have e to Y and then perform the quadratic formula so quadratic formula says negative B negative B so negative this would give me positive 2x you guys okay with that one plus or minus radical b^ 2- 4 * a * C all over 2 * a so this is B hey negative B sign changed CU I'm I'm taking the opposite of that so negative B plus or minus Square no problem b^ 2 this thing squared is 4x2 - 4 * a * C A is 1 C is 1 so we get - 4 all over two we okay with that so far okay so let's keep on working on that what are some things that you could do here can cross these out right now no Heavens no that's a plus and a that's double wrong all right plus and a minus jeez uh let look here maybe Factor the four 2x plus or minus this is going to be the square OT of 4 X2 - 1 do you see it square roots work like this when you have products you can take the square root of the first first Factor * of the second Factor so theun of 4 is actually 2 so e y = 2x + or - 2 < TK x^2 - 1 all over my two all over 2 now tell me something you can do now break up the FR you could break up the fraction I'm not going to factor the twos yeah if I factor these twos we get 2 * the quantity x + or - < TK x^2 - 1 all over 2 now can I simplify my twos now it's appropriate you can't simplify unless you have factored everything has to be multiplied together these are gone so e to the Y working over here now is X Plus orus < TK of x^2 minus one now I want to talk about the plus and minus real quick couple little little notes here e to the Y has to be positive do you agree with that exponential is always positive the domain our domain is 1 to Infinity that we're working with here here's the problem if I plug in numbers from 1 to Infinity most of them are going to be negatives uh sorry most of uh most of this is going to be negative so I plug in numbers like five or something if I did that 5 plus I'm good but 5 minus I'm not good this would be 5 minus theun 25 - 1 s 24 this would give me negatives which does not fall inside my domain does that make sense so for that reason it's really not defined for this so we're going to take that out so e to the Y because of our domain we can't have that e to the Y is got to be positive and if I plug in number in here this part the minus part this would not work very well this right here would give us negatives and we know that e to the Y has to be positive does that make sense to you so we we omit the the minus instead we keep just a plus and we're almost done how do we get rid of the E how would you do that yeah if I take natural log on both sides then Ln of left side equals Ln of right side do you see it that goes away we get y = Ln x + < TK x^2 -1 and last let's look back at what Y is what we defined y as Y is actually C inverse so make a little substitution C inverse of X is now Ln x + < TK x^2 - 1 and that is our proof should F feel okay with that one did you follow that fancy pants math right you know we it was nothing nothing really fancy actually uh it's all algebra all of it no calculus what do you see any derivatives see any limits no it's all algebra and it's really just quadratic formula that's it just quadratic formula and you work it all the way down take an L on both sides and and you're good to go the rest of them can be proved likewise similarly um what I want to talk about now if there's no questions I want to talk about derivatives do you guys have any questions on the proof I'm not going to make you do the proof I think they have an example uh in the homework where where they have you do the other one if you did this one can you guys see it's going to be almost exactly the same only thing it's going be different is that's a minus okay works exactly the same that's the idea what I want to do now is I want to talk about derivatives of these guys uh I'll prove one derivative I'll list the rest of them we'll do a couple examples and that'll be basically it for the section you okay any questions do you need this still do you have it written down good okay which one we prove the let's stick with that one let's find the derivative of this caution verse let's do that so remember that so what we know is that we just proved that hyperbolic cosine inverse is equal to Ln x + < TK X 2 - 1 so we know that for a fact here's the deal what I want to do right now is I want to start finding out the derivatives of these things what is the derivative of C inverse how do we find that well maybe we can do it right here since we have a definition we should be able to do that so tell you what let's take a derivative on both sides that'll give us derivative of cost inverse equals well because that's a function of X it's Ln do you know how to take a derivative of Ln yeah now we can take derivatives of these things so since we know the definition of it these shouldn't actually be very hard at all so if I want to find out derivative of C inverse it's actually the same as the derivative of this nasty piece of junk you know what I want to do I want to see if we can if we remember the derivative of Ln so we're going to do this kind of like an exercise I want you to do the derivative of this thing see what you get so go for it you should know how to do derivative of Ln right do it go for it do you see any chain rules always so derivative of Ln one over the inside times the derivative of the inside so derivative Ln one here's our inside one over the inside this is by the chain R so 1 over this times the derivative of the inside remember I told you about derivatives let the DDX tell you where the calculus is one over inside time derivative of inside we're done with Calculus here did you guys make it that far do you all do that one cool many of you are getting really fast at derivatives which is great so what's the derivative of x by the way what's the integral of one okay keep that in mind when you're doing these integrals if you get integral of DX integral DX that means integral of 1 DX that becomes an X okay just some people had a little issue with that so I want to make sure you guys know that so derivative of x is 1 not zero it's one plus I'm going to do this one in my head hopefully you get the same thing this becomes a one half so you bring down the 1/2 you would have leave the inside alone to thetive 1/2 goes you subtract one and then by the chain rule by the way those brackets are important by the chain rule we have oh sorry by the chain rule we have what derivative inside that's right we'd have the 2x I want to know if you made it down that far show hands if you did did you get that um if you didn't follow this the first time remember that this derivative is one no problem you can do these derivatives separately so this is x^2 - 1 to the2 bring down the 1/2 leave the inside the same subtract one derivative of the inside is 2X and that's our appropriate derivative now we're going to make it a little bit prettier so uh tell me something that you see here twos are gone like it okay so let's pretty this thing up we got 1/x + < TK x^2 - 1 that hasn't changed in a while we're going to have a 1 plus here's our 1 plus X over The sare < TK x^2 - 1 make sure you have brackets or parentheses or something wouldn't you multiply the X by both the one and the never mind okay you guys right with that one yeah now this looks pretty bad and if I gave you for a formula for if I gave this to you as a formula for derivative you'd be like uh I'm sorry what now so no we're going to make this thing prettier all right how we make this thing prettier is there's two terms here let's make them go together for one term let's make one fraction out of that we do that which is really easy because it's one we're going to have X2 - 1 over X2 - 1 so let's do that ^2 - 1 over < TK x^2 - 1 plus X X < TK x^2 - 1 if you didn't follow this this is exactly the same is this still equal to one this is still one yeah absolutely so all we're doing is writing that as as this fraction so that we have a common denominator I'm going to move over here now so with that in mind well now we can make this one fraction so we're going to have one over nasty stuff times worse nasty stuff Square < TK of x^2 - 1 and then plus X all over Square < TK x^2 - 1 okay once show hands you can follow me that far so remember this is a proof right now obviously you're not going to do this every single time you get a derivative of cost inverse you're going to do what I'm about to give you now do you see why we made it nicer do you see anything that helps us here I hope that you do do you see it do you see that this and this are identical by the commutativity of addition they're exactly exactly the same they are gone which says that let's go back to the beginning we had the derivative of hyperbolic cosine inverse of x and we worked on the right hand side with this logarithm all the way down and we ended up finding this is 1 over < TK x^2 - 1 and that is our first uh first formula for derivatives so this one actually works if we have C inverse of X we know the Der of cos inverse X is 1/ < tk^ - 1 do they look really similar to your hyperbolic functions they're going to be really similar all right really similar because they come from the same idea of logarithm so uh which you're going to get the one/ junk times derivative of junk so since they're all find as x's and square roots we're going the same thing so that's the first one by the way there's another way to uh to prove this if you want do you want another way to prove it or is this good sure another way another way uh if you did it this way so or different type of proof just for funsies if y equals c and I'm going to go really fast on this one C inverse of x uh this is happens if x = cos y if I take a derivative on both sides uh by the way keep this in mind we're going to use it later if I take a derivative on both sides this becomes one this right here we actually know the derivative for c y do you remember what it is C right times Dy DX because we got the chain you guys okay with the chain rule we get the chain rule so if we solve for this thing then Dy DX = 1/ c y I'll just divide that by both divide that on both sides now because of our definition let's see uh that right equals this so working from here if we wanted to solve for this guy right here what I'd probably do is I add this and subtract 1 so cos^2 y - 1 = 6 s y you guys okay with that one okay take a square root this is this is an identity I gave you like the First first day we had this stuff do you remember that one hopefully you do look at the video if you didn't it's very beginning the video take a square root on both sides and we get CCH y = Square t cos^2 y -1 I switch sides and take a square root and that's exactly what this thing is only think back to what cos y equals for us cos y is how much how much it's X so then since yalun of from here x^2 - 1 and that solves it for us again so 1/ < TK x one same same thing different way to prove it uh this one's a little bit more direct this one uses a different proof that we've already had in class but it's faster so one's kind of shortcut proof one is the long proof stemming directly from the definition of what uh C inverse is do you guys follow both of them good good for you that's fantastic now let me give you the rest of them so we know that if I do a derivative of C inverse we end up getting 1 over the < TK x^2 - one I'm just going to give you the rest of them not going to prove the rest of them some of the proofs are similar some are a little bit different uh but here we go hyperbolic sign inverse oh you know what can I do something for you to show you that these are going to be uh obviously what are you going to use with a lot of these derivatives what's the answer 90% of time when I ask okay good yeah you're going to use chain rule on a lot of these so I'm going to change them to use just so you recognize that we're going to do chain rule a lot so if we have let's see hyperbolic s inverse we'd have one over they s and cosine look at this really similar all the time especially with these hyperbolic so we have 1 < TK U ^2 + 1 DX if we want hyperbolic tangent inverse we end up getting 1 over 1 - u^2 to udx if we want hyperbolic secant inverse we get -1 / U then < TK 1 - U ^2 d u DX are these looking familiar to you they look so much like the hyperbolic which is why I said hey write these on a not card make sure they're all right that way you can look at them when you're going through your work okay if we want hyperbolic cosecant inverse of you it's going to look just like this one only let's see uh oh you know what I I'm sorry I read that wrong no I didn't I read right thought it made same very similar we're going to have U ^2 + 1 and lastly hyperbolic cotangent inverse we got which one tangent and coent are the same yeah let me check on that it in the book too it is right it's exactly the same which is really weird uh but yeah you get the same thing let's think about why sing from the definition of yeah that would be that's interesting check one more thing for me uh one of these things has an absolute value the other one doesn't which one is is it do you know Patrick um theose cosecant has the absolute value right okay but the secant doesn't okay good I know there's one little thing in there it's a little weird thing so what I want out of you I want you to be able to use these things they're just formulas for right now so what we're going to do is we're going to we're going to do one example of a derivative it's going to be really really really really similar to your let's find the derivative of this guy let's go through it as a team we're just going to do one example right now like I said we don't use this a whole lot and even if we did you got your derivatives they work really similar to your hyperbolic so uh you have the formulas you're going to have a little note card on them no big deal so let's let's go through and let's see if you you see the way I see this thing what's the first thing that you guys see on this product R gives away right there correct yeah go ahead and do the product rule So Pro rule says no problem we've been doing this since our last Calculus class derivative of the first 10 of second plus the first time der second so oh let's see if we know this one what's the derivative of e to X so we're going to get this whole thing back again e to X hyperbolic secant inverse of 3x nothing changes there plus e x does not change let's look at this one this is where you use this stuff um right here what acts as your U what is your U so 3x is what we're going to put see let's follow this down we are here so 3x is what you're going to put here and what you're going to put here and then you're GNA Square it did you guys do that yeah if you didn't make it that far can you follow me on this one yeah so we're using this because he it says hyperb inverse our 3x is our U so U here U here don't change any of this stuff and don't forget chain rule here so we've got1 I'm going write everything out not going to do a whole lot of math in my head here 3x then I've got a square root then I've got a one first then a minus then a 3X s and then and then what good this is where people forget a lot of constants right I'm off by three oh there's a three coming it's coming from right here or they're saying wow why isn't there a three up here I I got that three if something simplifies okay it's because you forgot the chain rule so don't forget the chain Ru make sure I mean I hopefully I've beat that in your head time and time again throughout this whole class rule chain rule chain rule so we're going to do it a lot of times so we keep on going we got e x hyperbolic secant inverse of 3x and then we've got an ed X we got a ne1 over all this stuff of course we'll make that 9x stimes 3 3x is 3 tell me some things that happened here gone and gone that's multiplied that's all multiplied that's connected that's fantastic we'll make it a little bit nicer what I'm going to do here is instead of a negative I'm going to make this a minus I'm going to put my e e to the X on the top of my fraction and we get e to the X hyperbolic inverse of 3x minus E X over let's see what's still there what's still there X is still there and that's the whole thing you want to factor out the Ed X you could you could if you factor out the Ed X you have just hyperic inverse 3x - one over this you could do that too should P feel okay with with that one is it doable for you guys after dealing with the hyperbolic yeah it's not a big deal okay you just have six more formulas to to really go through uh do you have any questions comments or anything at all are you sure are you ready to take a break from dealing with all this trigonometric and hyperbolic stuff for just a little bit now we're going to start section 6.7 there's no integrals we're not going [Applause] to now we're just going to leave it right there just kind of a a uh a fundamental level of approach on these derivatives we're not going to get to the integrals we're just going to do the do with these things okay keep it light this is pretty light right 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 6.7:  Evaluating Limits of Indeterminate Forms
all right well let's move on what we're going to talk about in section 6.7 we are going to talk about indeterminate forms of limits let's explain what that is in just a bit as we go through it actually indeterminate forms of limits and how we can approach these in an easier fashion than you were probably used to if you took calculus one at this particular school so indeterminant forms in determin forms of limits limits oh you guys remember limits they're back limits are the fundamental idea of calculus if we don't have limits we don't have calculus in fact everything we do in calculus revolves around limits and your your Calculus one teacher should have mentioned that that derivatives are essentially a limit idea it's a limit of a difference quotient it's a limit of a slope that's all the derivative is remember that how you took the two points if you watched my previous videos on calculus one I took the two points and made them really really really really really close remember that the idea really close is instead of two points this one you can't make it one you can't get one point because you can't find the slope at one point but you can make it so close that it doesn't make a difference and that idea is called a limit and then we find the slope of that so that that limit ideas how we get this idea of calculus so we're going to talk about indeterminate forms of limits and how to deal with them here's what an indeterminate form is one of the first ones an indeterminate form is something like this if we've got a limit as X approaches some number of a function of X over a function of X and if when we evaluate this limit you guys have seen this before trust me in your in your Calculus class and it gives us 0 over 0 have you ever seen those before yeah yeah that's typically where you divide out the largest power in the denominator remember that and when like X approaches infinity and things like this well uh or you get infinity overin same same idea well here we're going to do something a little bit different uh this is also when X approach is an actual number and this happens we can do the same thing here so a little bit different from what you were taught this right here is called an indeterminant form uh of the the form 0 over Z so there's several forms we'll get to one in just a little bit that's different than this but in general these things are pretty difficult to compute um sometimes they're easy because you can Factor you can simplify but often times they're pretty pretty difficult so one idea that someone came up with is instead of looking at directly let's look at how the derivatives of this and this are behaving let's look at how the the ratio of those derivatives is behaving so so that idea of the ratio how the ratio of the derivatives is behaving gives us the same limit of these functions it's called the lalls rule say lall yeah looks like l hospital except it's missing a couple letters um so let me show you the the idea here this is not approv I'm not going to prove it okay I'm going to show you the idea of why it works through examples so to to show you that the answer you get is the same for these two examples it's not approv so I'm going to skip over this proof for ly talls uh you need to know that it works so the idea behind ly talls for indeterminate forms of 0 over Z is that I'm going to look at the derivative of this guy over the derivative of this guy I'm going to see how those behave and the way those behave in relationship to each other or in ratio to each other is the same end behavior as what these things are going to do do you follow that you you want me do an example for you yeah okay here we go so I want you to look at the limit as X approaches 2 of 4 * x^2 - 4 over x - 2 okay please listen carefully in order for this next thing I'm going to show you to work you have to make sure you have an indeterminant form what you have to do first indeterminate form indeterminate form that's right you have to make sure it's 0 over 0 if it's not 0 over 0 you cannot do this is that clear so you have to make sure so plug in the number shoot number that about limits if you plug in the number and it works you're good just plug it in you're good to go so plug it in first plug in the two what do you get over here Z over that's the problem so we actually get 0 over Z if we plug in that two so we get 0 over Z we go all right well that's of this this first type of indeterminant form so we can work around that with limits and do things like this this is what you're used to what you're used to is doing all right well this is x - 2 x + 2 over x - 2 and if I can get rid of the problem for instance if the discontinuity is removable you have a removable discontinuity a whole remember that from your your calcul one class if you can cross it out it's a hole if you can't cross it out it's an ASM toote so if you can cross out the hole here the the removable disc continuity then you can find the limit really easily because limits don't care what happens at the point happens right before that if it's going to the same thing not at it but right before the limit still exists that's fantastic that's what we're using here so this ISS all right cool as soon as you cross those out now can I plug in two yeah of course I can this is 16 we okay with that one yeah we also used so some proofs that we used uh that we found out earlier so if I had sin XX as X approaches zero well look at this what's sign of zero Z what's uh Z that's 0 Z that's another indeterminate form you with Me Now by definition that was proved for you in your Calculus one class we know this we know that that was true do you remember that one whenever you get sin XX as X approaches Z the limit of sin XX is actually one I I'm not going to prove it to you it's by the squeeze theorem it's actually not that hard um but if you want that again Watch one of the calculus one videos it's proved on there right so that that's proved now please don't do this oh well Mr Leonard said anything over anything gives you one anything over itself gives you one that's not what I'm talking about all right there's an actual proof that goes along with this obviously that is not true for this one uh so this is indeterminate absolutely and we know this definition now what I'm going to show you is that there's another way to go around this besides factoring because you can't always Factor besides using definitions because there's not definitions for everything does that make sense we're going to use something called lal's Rule so here's another idea this is the big idea again called lyall's Rule looks like l hospital doesn't have the S so we be here's the idea a limit of a function of X over a function of X as X approaches a is the same thing same limit as the the derivative of f ofx over the derivative of G ofx but but please please recognize this this is only if it's what only if it's in determinate form only if the original limit is 0 over Z okay also one more thing uh just make it make a note on your your papers here am I talking about a quotient rule here no no no it's not it's not that hard some of you guys are in the habit of making this math really really hard or way harder than it has to be I'm not talking about quotient rule I'm talking about really easy derivative of the top over derivative of the bottom not a quotient rule write that down not a quotient rule so tell you what we're going to do these examples one more time I'm going to show you how this works and you're probably going to love if you didn't already love me you're going to love me right now all right get ready to love me it's almost Valentine's Day so I like chocolate we doing two okay 4x2 - 4 over x - 2 okay check this out awesome it's really cool here's the things you need to check uh do we have a limit if I plug in the number do I get 0 over zero yes you already have that over here so what I know is that this is true my original limit is 0 over Z lal's rule is in effect so what I get to do and I always put like a little arrow with a l l tall or an H doesn't matter what you do I used L you can use H you like H's better than L's l r l rules my last name is Leonard so booah that's why I use it the Leonard rule so here's what it says you keep everything the same for your limit just take the derivative of this don't use silly things like product rule because you don't need it four stays there times what's the derivative of the inside what's the Der of this stop when you plug in the number and you don't get z0 Z over Z anymore so if you plug in two does it work plug in two how much you get how about that which one's easier that one that's easier only if 0 over Z but then that works every time check this one limit sin XX I made no statement whether this had to be poly b omals or or this this works with functions okay so if it's 0 over Z you can do it if you plug in zero do you get 0 over Z let's try this one if I do L tall's rule I get a limit as X approaches zero of remember it's not a quotient rule it's not what we're talking about we're talking about derivative of the top your numerator derivative of your denominator so what's the derivative of sinx what's the Der of X bam now you have have to check every single time that you do lby tall's rule you don't just say I'm just going to do it five times and we'll see what we get okay that's not the way this stuff works you guys have to check it so if you plug in zero do you get Z over zero no no obviously not this is a one there's no way this going to become a zero cosine of Z is over bam there you go so lal's rule works for pols no problem all also works for trick functions as long this is a big deal here as long as you have very good all right we're going to continue our talk about how to do limits of an indeterminant form now so far we've just looked at this one what happens if a limit of some rational function what rational expression here equals 0 over 0 if that happens what we learned is that instead of thinking about the limits of the functions themselves we can think about the limit of the derivatives of those functions again not a quoti rule just a derivative of FX over the derivative of G ofx and figure out what that limit is and it's going to be the same limit as what we started with uh that right there is called the lals rule we've used it a couple times but we're going to start adding to our repertoire now uh we're going to start seeing well is there other things that we can do and one of thing that we can look at is what happens if we don't have 0 over Z but maybe we have a limit where the functions equal Infinity Infinity well consider this if you have Infinity over infinity then you can actually manipulate this so that if you did instead of f ofx over G of x if you manipulated it notice that this is this is equivalent if you did 1 over G ofx over 1 over f ofx u first I need to make sure that algebraically you're okay with this do you understand that this is is this yeah do you see that so if F ofx went to Infinity 1/ F ofx goes to zero did you catch that so you're just flipping the that's right I'm just kind of doing uh basically the reverse of a complex fraction complex fractions say that what you do is you multiply by the reciprocal this would of course be F ofx over G of X it's the same thing only we're using it this way saying well check this out if G of X goes to Infinity 1 over G of x 1 over infinity would go to zero if F ofx goes to Infinity 1 over F ofx would go to zero what this basically says is that and you don't have to show this okay you don't have to show it what it says is that if you have Z over zero this will work also if you have Infinity over infinity because you can do this this will also work so we basically have um have two statements here we say that if FX over G of x = 0 0 or if we have f ofx g ofx equal Infinity over infinity we can do L talls in either case does that make sense I'm just adding one more condition so that we don't have to change it to Z over zero if you ever get infinity over infinity it's basically the same thing so one a couple little little notes for you I'm just going to rewrite this statement if the limit of our functions equals 0 over Z or now we have a new one Infinity over infinity then the limit of FX over G ofx as X approaches a is equivalent to the limit of the derivative of FX over the derivative of G of X as X approaches a that's the whole thing that is what lal's rule says if you have 0 over zero or Infinity over infinity show hands if feel okay with with this okay a couple other little notes that you need to be aware of this doesn't just work as X approaches a this will work as X approaches a from the right or from the left so remember those one-sided limits you guys did a long time ago lal's rule will still work for that it'll also work if x approaches Infinity both positive and negative so uh some other notes Here Also work for X approaches a from the right or X approaches a from the left or X approaches positive infinity or X approaches negative Infinity all those things are fine so basically what it's saying is that lal's rule works all the time for for whatever you're approaching positive Infinity no problem they Infinity okie dokie uh a from the right a from the left or a altogether not an issue so we can use lalls rule basically all the time there's only one thing and it's an important thing that you got to do before you do lyall's rule we talked about it briefly last time but I want to make sure you have this written down in order to do ly tall's rule you must verify that this sorry we this or this is actually true you have to have this so what I'm going to write down is you must check that it is an indeterminate form before you do lall's rule please do that thank deal you must make [Music] sure you have 0 over Z or Infinity over infinity first you have to do it let me give you an example about why give you an example about y let's say that I give you the limit of cosine X overx as X approaches zero from the right hand side look at what's going to happen here if I plug in Z remember that this is continuous so you can just plug in zero and it's the same thing as a one-sided limit you don't have to worry about that so just plug in zero what's cosine of Z what's uh what's this as X approaches Z from the right is that an interminate form no no this actually is going to go to Infinity so this thing is positive Infinity however let's say that we said oh well wait a minute can't I just use lows all the time look what would happen if I did lals rule I would get a limit as X approaches zero from the right what's the derivative of cosine please derivative of x one this would give us 0 over one or 0 did we get the same thing no no what this is telling you is that lal's rule does not work unless you have 0 over Z or Infinity over infinity that's why this is important you have to make sure that you have that indeterminate form before you start doing all this Lal junk does that make sense so pans if you feel okay with with that one all right so we can't do it if it's not zero Z or Infinity over infinity um now when it is oh my gosh it's so nice so I want to practice some examples they'll gradually get a little bit more difficult we'll start off nice and easy I want to make sure that you guys see the concept here and then uh of course what are we going to be doing all the time what's LS do it does whatever what Z INF 0 Z infinity infinity but how do you do lby TS rule what are you doing derivative of the quotient or top and bottom top and bottom good so that's really all we're doing a lot of derivatives and then checking every time by the way every time you use lal's rule you want to check again if it's 0 over Z you can actually keep going with it do another derivative no problem or Infinity over infinity no problem keep on going until you can actually solve your your limit that's the idea you see some examples yes sir okay let's do limit as X approaches zero e to x -1 over 2x okay ladies and gentlemen what's the first thing that you've got to do in order to solve this limit what are you to do okay so we got to make sure we got to verify that it is one of these forms so let's do that if we plug in zero this is by the way what you should be doing every time you get a limit anyway just plug the number in because if it works you're good to go if it doesn't work well now we have a couple scenarios that we can work with so if we plug in zero what's e to the 0 one - one so this is 0 over 2 * 0 can we use low with that fantastic so we're going to show that all right well let's do a l TS rule I know I'm keep asking you but I want to make sure quotient rule or just derivative of the top just our numerator so let's do it look how nice this becomes by the way when you're doing limits I don't know how strict your Calculus one teacher was because I wasn't him uh or her I'm definitely not a her but uh wasn't him either so you need to be writing the limit every single time until you get to actually evaluate the limit okay what you can't do is go I'm going to ignore that and do the D that doesn't make sense okay you have to have that limit every single time until you actually get the answer does that make sense you got to do that so derivative of e to X what's that of one so this is I love that over der of 2x is just two now every time you do a ly T you you reevaluate you see if it works if it works you're done if it doesn't work if you get zero over zero you keep going if you don't and you can't use Li TOS you to do something else so can we plug in zero here let's see e to the 0 is notice here I have the limit here I've actually evaluated it worked out for me I don't need to write the limit anymore our answer our limit is 1 12 you guys okay with that one is there any time where you'll just keep taking like a second third oh absolutely you have multiple and we're going to get there right now I'm keeping it kind of easy so you just want to make the variable disappear event uh no not NE I'll just stick with me here I'll show you some let's look at the limit as X approaches Infinity of Ln X overx now we already talked about this is it okay for X to approach Infinity with lital ro yes so that's not an issue for us what is an issue is we got to make sure we have 0 over Z or Infinity over infinity so let's check it out if I plug in in Infinity let's think about that what is lnx as X goes to Infinity infity also Infinity okay how about X as X approaches is that something that satisfies our conditions yeah it's indeterminate form so what that says is shoot just do a lital rule um by the way I am not going to be spending a whole lot of time showing you derivatives like these anymore I'm going to kind of expect that you you get that all right so some of the chain R I'm going to be this doesn't involve chain rule it doesn't involve coent Ru it's pretty easy but just heads up from now on I'm probably not going to be showing you explicitly the chain rule uh I'm kind of expecting you you understand that okay uh so when I have like sine of 3x I'll probably just be doing 3 cosine 3x or cosine 3x * 3 and the chain was kind of implied there does that make sense so just to keep it a little bit quicker because I don't I'm not supposed to teach you chain rule every single time all right um but if you have questions let me know can you the derivative of Ln X 1X over over what so derivative of Ln X is 1x der of X is one derivative of the numerator no problem D denominator got it let's plug in the infinity again how much is one over infinity Z so we get 0 over one you don't even need the one really it's just 0 over one this is just zero so this becomes zero our limit zero do you see how nice Lal R makes that my goodness it's so much better so much easier can we do some a little bit more difficult ones yes do you guys understand these so far yeah having fun yet yeah do you like this section you should compared to some of the other stuff we've done it's nice okay let's let's see that one limit as X approaches Pi of 2 sin^2 x over 1 + cosine X tell me again the first thing that we need to do before we start working with this limit let's check that is it uh let's find out let's find find out do you know what s of Pi is uh Z it is zero so 0 squ is still * 2 is0 how about cosine of pi how much is cosine Pi 1+ 1 is z is lo going to work yeah I made no statement about whether these were pols or trigonometric or or square roots or anything it works all the time so if we have trig don't worry about it just do low rule again remember it's not quotient rule it's just derivative of the numerator over derivative of the denominator so when we do this um show me what you're doing though put a little L some people use the H for the the H part of Li tals I use l i don't know why just do keep writing your limit as much as you need to take you down to evaluate so if we're using derivatives here for our numerator what's going to happen is this is a chain do you see it 2 * 2 gives you four you'll leave the inside alone you'll multiply by the derivative of the inside 4 sinx cosine x uh quick head now if you're okay with that one by the chain rule good now denominator what happens to the one disappear gone can you do derivative of cosine good I like the negative that's fantastica sin also what should we do next after we've done those derivatives check it again I would check it right now what I would do is probably simplify if I can maybe can you simplify make this problem easy if you if you can do you see sign over sign yes hello now am I doing another L rule right now so don't don't put the L or the H if you're not doing lal's rule what we're doing is just we're simplifying guys we're not doing anything major just a little bit of algebra we have -4 cosine X there's no denominator at all anymore now after you simplified here's where you're probably going to want to plug in the number to see if you if you can get something out of it so if you plug in pi cosine Pi is time4 it's four okay show hands we're okay with that one you guys getting the idea so far the idea is check for z00 0 Z or Infinity over infinity if you have that cool man do a derivative of the numerator do a derivative of the denominator simplify first then plug it in again repeat process okay number one thing we're doing is we're checking to see if our limit even works we're plugging in the whatever X approaches and seeing if we have zero Z or Infinity over infinity because we can do stuff with that if we actually get a number that's easier you're just done all right but we got to check this so let's plug in Infinity what do we get if we plug in Infinity infity sure this is definitely Infinity this is two time okay that's 8 INF that's Infinity over infinity is Lal is going to work yes in full effect so we're going to do a Lal rule here we'll have our limit X approaches Infinity so tell me what's going to happen on the numerator can you do derivative of the numerator now let's do derivative of the denominator what's going to happen here uh be it is chain rule so derivative of this is e 2x time 2 because of the chain rule so e 2x stays there remember with chain rule you're taking the derivative and multiplying by the derivative of this inside part if you want to call it the exponent so derivative of 2x is 2 and then we have it e 2x you guys okay with that so far yeah now check this out what's that going to give you infinity over infity can I do lall's rule again yes keep going until you can't okay that's the idea here so notice we're checking again this is still Infinity over infinity so I'll do lals again if I do Lal rule again since I had Infinity over infinity it's indeterminate form L works I get 6X and I get let's do the same thing we have another two that'll be four e 2x again another two because of the chain rule yet again we still have Infinity over infinity let's do it again so we checked for it we had in indeterminate form LS rule we had it again L rule we had it again L rule derivative of the numerator is what please over what are you going to get on the denominator so another chain rle we add a four notice the chain R is going to give you another factor of two that's 8 e the 2x now we're going to check it again do we still get infinity over infinity no no we get six over infinity you get see it how much is six over infinity it's zero zero you have a constant over something going to Infinity that's zero now question if you're really thinking what if this was x to the 31st instead of just the third we have been doing it a lot you keep doing it 31 time 32 times and you're going to get zero again do you see why yeah the e to the x is never going to away so it's going to be Infinity no matter what if you have a polom that's going to gradually reduce down to zero which is very interesting in that some I would just look at that me now you're not going to do this because you're going to show you work I would look uh polom something that's always infinity that's that's zero for sure but you're going to show me more of that okie dokie anyway that is the idea now we're going to make it just a little bit more funner funner means harder do you guys have any questions so far before we continue have I explained this well enough for you to completely understand the idea here yes does that mean if there's an e over another E there's no way to ever solve because it'll always be Infinity it depends depends on what that is sometimes you can manipulate that um sometimes you can sometimes you can do other techniques for that if we come across one I'll I'll be happy to show you which one we just okay this one's going to take us just a little while so stick with me here what's the first thing you do you walk me through this what what are you doing here okay so we plug in the zero uh what do we get when we plug in the zero that is not that is not a trivial thing to do you actually have to show that it is in determinate 0 over Z you guys okay with the 0 over Z so if you have 0 over Z what are you guys doing go ahead and do it so nice is not a quotient rule right these are just these are I mean should be fairly straightforward most of the time did you get 3x^2 1 - SEC x d of tent is see squ now what are you to do do here what check see do so we're going to plug in zero again what's this go to Z over this is one let's plug in zero to secant keep in mind secant is one over cosine cosine of 0 is one 1 over 1 gives you 1 1 - 1 gives you what are you do now keep it going go ahead and do it again the numerator is cool denominator is kind of stinky it's going to get kind of bad here real quick let's see what's going on so numerator hopefully you got 6X that's pretty pretty basic derivative of one gives you that piece is gone that's nice do you see it here what is that R that's a chain roll that's exactly what we did over here so we're going to have -2 SEC x times the derivative of see X follow me on this one this is what I said I'm going to be doing the chain kind in my head here so check it out this is zero it's gone this is chain rule bring down the two so -2 leave the inside alone so -2 s x times the derivative of the inside which is our secant x are you with me so we bring down the two that's -2 SEC X derivative of SEC X is SEC X tangent X you get yeah we're going to simplify it you're always simplifying and making this as nice as possible before you move on especially if you have to do another lals I mean think about that there's a multiplication and you you don't want to do a double product rule right make this thing a little bit nicer so we're not doing LS rule so don't show me you're doing L rule if you're not we got 0 6X over -2 sec^2 x Tan x well that was fun by show hand you feel okay with that one yes yes no chain rule bring two der inside leave inside what are you going to do now it in so plug in zero what's this become what's this become undefined I don't even care what this is this is zero this is tangent of zero is zero so I don't even care what this is cuz this part is z is that clear for you yeah so 0 0 tangent of 0 is z what are you do now yay go ahead do not look don't a product rule yeah you're right it's a product rule let's let's do this together okay do you see the product rule yeah inside the product rule you have another chain rule almost exactly like the one we just did so these things can explode especially with these trig function like secant so numerator man numerator is nice we just get six like that one here we're going to have derivative of the first time the second plus the first time der of the second um if you want to do it just below there maybe that's what I'll do here derivative of the first don't forget the C on secant thanks one of you who got that cuz it just doesn't look right so derivative of the first * the second plus the first time derivative of second I want to double check on my work did you guys get the same thing that I got shouldn't there be another you know what I forgot it oh dear you're right I bet maybe I better write out take my own advice gosh darn it okay derivative of the first times the second because we definitely don't want to forget anything plus the first times the derivative of the second thank you for that yeah I did forget one der of the first * the second plus the first times the Dera of the second just take that -2 and put it with a sec squ that's fine to do that so here this is very much like this one just we have -2 so derivative here gives us -4 SEC x to the first Power Times the derivative of the inside by the chain rule we got secant x tangent X but then we have another Tan x that's right so -4 leave the inside Alone multip by derivative of the inside the derivative of secant x is see X tangent X and then we have the tangent I need show hands if you okay with with that one just make sure okay good moving on let's change that to a minus - 2 secant 2 x time Dera of tangent is another sec 2 x okay if we put everything together we have -4 SEC 2 x tangent 2 x - 2 sec to 4th X it looks nasty it's not that bad when you really think about it uh first I want to know are you okay with with this part isn't the SEC Cub what did I do have to leave the No it should be it should still be secant squar the chain will brings us two down so you have a secant * a see gives you see Square okay it's see Square Tang Square this is this is correct okay good comment any other comments or questions are you seeing ladies and gentlemen where everything's coming from you kind of shut up on me here for a little bit are you okay with it yeah like oh my gosh are you all right with it it's it's trick but we know derivatives right so we know chain rule we know product rule we know derivative of secant and tangent so we should be okay with this stuff see Square Tang squ see 2 4th now what do we do here does the six change don't worry about this CU it's connected to this what's tangent of zero so this whole piece Z zero now we already did secant x where X is zero how much is secant of zero it's one how much is 1 to the 4th power time -2 remember this whole thing is so what this is we stop writing the limit because we're done with the limit we have six we've actually evaluated over -2 our answer is3 that limits ne3 okay that that's pretty bad but I wanted to give you a hard one that way you understand how to deal with this I don't want to give you all easy ones and then you get your homework go oh my goodness so this is a little difficult right stick with it all it's all this is is check for 0 over Z check for Infinity over infinity and then do lals rule tell you can't do it anymore after that hopefully you can evaluate your limit show hands be okay with these ones now that's all well and good but sometimes let's you we're going to have some different indeterminant forms so I want to check those out so question is what about the cases where we have Infinity minus infinity what about the cases where we have one to the infinity or zero uh infinity to the zero or something like that something crazy well if ever you get this rate of infinity minus infinity something that don't do this well Infinity that's zero Infinity minus infinity hey zero done no we can't do that what you have to do is somehow manipulate this and so until you get 0 over Z or Infinity over infinity so you usually what that is is finding a common denominator and making one fraction out of it does that make sense to you so if you have this what about this we're going to use some algebra to get either 0 over Z or Infinity over infinity same thing happens with this uh if you had Infinity time0 something like that if you got Infinity time0 oh my goodness don't just say that that's zero I know it seems weird but that's not always the case we actually have to manipulate it to get infinity over infinity over z z this one's typically pretty easy and I'll show you that so quick example let's look at the limit as X approaches Z from the right hand side of 1x minus 1/ 1 - cosine X oh goodness hey what's the first thing that you should be doing on liit plug it in the zero let's do that let's plug it in if you plug in the zero from the right hand side from the right that it's from the right because this limit doesn't exist unless we go one-sided okay cuz it does this so you can't say at zero I had to give you a oneid limit for this specific case are you with me on that one so from the right this thing goes to Infinity this is infinity this thing goes well this is 1 over Z that thing goes to Infinity so we have Infinity minus infinity here do you guys see what I'm talking about all right if we got Infinity minus infinity we don't just say it's zero we got to work on this and one good way to work on this is if you have two fractions man just make them the same fraction put them on one fraction because then if you can get 0 over zero or infinity infinity you got lals question so one over Zer is also one would it be Infinity one over zero is infinity that's right as we go to the right that's a positive number right so we one over a number going to zero so this is from the right these are positive numbers so from the right is going towards zero this way it's doing this the graph is actually doing this but X itself is getting really close to zero but positive so if you're taking a number a constant number dividing by something really close to zero that's going to be Infinity it's going to Infinity question so that plus is what's giving you the infinity right if that plus or minus wasn't there you just plug in zero you have to think about the graph if you're going to do it graphically this is the graph going from the right hand side not to the right hand side from the right hand side it's going this way on this graph that's how that looks like we're going this way hey what's happened to my graph when I'm going this way it's doing that positive Infinity if that was a minus it would be negative Infinity does that make sense if it was this the limit would actually exist we could just say at zero because the limit would be positive Infinity they're both going that way you with me on that one okay shouldn't have done that that was just a recap of limits but hopefully that helped you all right so maybe one thing we can do is make this one fraction get everything on one fraction get a common denominator and then see what we got so if we do that notice I'll have to multiply by X over X I'll have to multiply by 1 - cosine X over 1 - cosine X you guys with me on that one yeah so we're going to get out of this is 1 - cine x - x all x * 1 - cos x you guys okay with that one you sure just some algebra just some common denominator stuff we're multiplying by 1 - cos x over itself and xx that's why we're getting 1 - cosine X from here - x when multiply by X the denominator is going to be the same one more thing I'm going to do I'm going to distribute this because if I have to do lal's rule I'd rather deal with a smaller product rule than a bigger one you can do either way you know what you want to leave it this way we could leave it that way no fine okay so I'm going to distribute that and I'm going to get x - x cine X still okay with it hey what's the next thing that we should do if we plug it in we get zero so plug in zero here how much you get one 1 - one is z minus one z Oh zero this whole thing is zero this is zero this is zero doesn't even matter what this is 0 - 0 is do you guys see that this is0 Z yes this is another litar rule let's go ahead and see if you can do litar rule I'm going to do on the board this one should be pretty easy pretty straightforward this one you're going to have what are you going to have here not a chain rule oh that would be that's a product rule keep in mind when you're doing the product rule uh you know I'll show you in a minute I'll see if you catch it go ahead and do it what's a derivative of one what's the derivative of cosine X is that netive so if this is neg so we'd have negative sinx negative would be this would be positive sinx are you okay with that one yeah um how about this one yeah did you already take care of the Der of the bottom well okay work on I'll give you another minute if you're going to do this product rule put a bracket up there or something because when you subtract that minus sign will have to distribute you catch that yeah so we're going to have derivative of the first hey that's not a big deal so der of first is 1 time the second plus the first time the derivative of the second this hey that's one minus we got a minus we put put a bracket up there derivative of the first is 1 * the 2 cosine X plus the first leave that alone derivative of the second is negative sinx of course I'm assuming you know how to do product R really really well right yeah all right so moving on what are you going to do with this stuff uh distribute the negative yeah probably I would probably move this here then distribute the negative so we'd have a limit as X approaches zero from the right we'd have sin x minus one notice we're not doing any calculus right now we're not doing any we've done uh just a common denominator we've done L's rule here but now we're we're not doing anything we're just kind of combining some stuff 1us cine X what's that sign going to Bei yep see plus that would change this to a minus that changes it back to a plus okay all at once all at once all on uh now what are you going to do zero let's do that so if we plug in zero here look it sign's a uh is it's continuous so the limit as X approaches Z from the right is the same as the limit as X approaches Z no no big deal so just plug in zero what's sign of zero minus one ah so we're not getting Z over zero here so L we can't do lob whatever happens we can't do litol rule after this are you clear on that can't do it so this is going to give you1 on the denominator let's do this I've got a one how about cosine of zero one- one plus one okay so one over what's that going to beity exactly right show P be okay with that one that's a little weird but my point is that when you get down to this you can't do ly talls rule anymore you can't just go ah I just want to do it again it doesn't work I already prove that to you so we have to actually manipulate this and see what happens here once you're done with Z over zero or Infinity over infinity just find out what the limit is uh work it through like you you already know how to do okie dokie let's do tell you what I think we'll do one more and then I'll show you a different interminate form oops I'm sorry this limit to Ln yeah sometimes all it takes is just a little manipulation to make this thing look the way that you want it to so for instance if we plug in zero right here does anybody know cose of zero remember that this is one/ s correct how much is sign of Z so this would be 1 over Z how much is that that's Infinity this one if I plug in what's sign of Z 1 - Z One Ln of one this is infinity time0 is what this is do you guys see what I'm talking about you got you got to do it you got to think through it but this is infinity time Z is what that is can you do Infinity time Z the way it is right there no no you don't put Infinity you don't put zero we actually have to do the work this is going to be kind of interesting to see that it's not going to be either one of those two numbers infinity or zero so this was Infinity because it's one over sign this is zero because we have Ln of one all right well you know what let's just think about what cosecant actually is cosecant is what again so if this is one/ s then we can change this limit into Ln 1 - sin x over what please did you guys follow that cosecant is one over sign therefore if cose is 1/ s you're just multiplying 1 sin x * Ln of this nasty stuff we're going to get Ln of 1 - sin x over sinx can you simplify the sin X's yet no heck no not at all what should you do right now now if you plug in the zero hopefully you see this this isn't going to change this is still going to be zero we didn't change that one at all this one well because we changed an Infinity down to a denominator that's going to be how much Z this is 0 over Z Now what can you do you do l so just by changing some things around make it make it something different make it one over sign instead of cosecant hey no big deal then it becomes 0 over Z not you have to be okay with that one it's a little manipulation here so we're changing these problems little by little go ahead and see if you guys can do the ls on this oh goodness so we had Infinity time Z we said hey this this is fine I like that one this one let's rewrite a little bit cant is 1/ s therefore we have Ln over s and that gives us 0 over Z that's we're able to do lals rule if you do the lals rule here one of these parts is really easy what's the derivative of sinx I'm sorry what's the [Music] D do you remember how to do the derivative of Ln what do you have to use here 90% of the time you're right yay chain Ru that's right so we'd have one over in one over the inside times the derivative of the inside let's look at the Der inside everybody derivative of one is derivative of s so we're going to have negative that's right negative cosine X so you okay with that so far you sure don't plug anything in yet don't do that what I want you to do right now is simplify right after you do that to simplify if you can do you see something that simplifies cosiness are done yeah they're gone so if we simplify our cosiness wow the problem that looked like it was going to be really hard becomes really easy so we get no ly TS rule we don't have to do that we're just simplifying here folks you're not always doing ly talls rule this only took one of them so we're going to have a limit as X approaches zero from the right we got -1 see where the negatives coming from yeah over 1 - sin x and now we should try to do that do do the plugin now we should try to evaluate the limit since we have1 we know that Lal rule will not work anymore hopefully this thing will work for us s of Z 1 - 0 so we have1 over one we have one that's the idea quick show hand feel okay with with that one now sometimes and this is where it gets a little bit little bit more interesting it really is more interesting these are these are fun and good and all but they actually get kind of tedious I got z z no problem sometimes we get some really interesting things interesting limits and we can do something pretty cool with them it's probably going to blow your mind a little bit like a m grenade you ready for it what if I asked you to do the limit as X approaches zero from the right of this and you go wait a minute what now uh where's X going to Z to the power of Z so this is 0 to the power of zero one one Z to Z is not one what is z to the z z I would say zero ah it's in determinate because we don't know CU you anything to zero power is one okay but zero to any power is zero so what do we have oh God which one uh zero or one I don't know crap let's make up something that will work we're just going to make up our own math here okay let's make up something that will work I'll give you a note and this is probably we'll end it and I'll start here probably next time but look at this for any limit if you have a function of x raised to another function of X can you please verify that's exactly what I have going on here yes no function of X raised to a function of X I'm not talking about X squ here okay I'm talking about x to the X something with an X here if this equals 0 to the 0 or Infinity to the 0o or 1 to the infinity if it's one of those try this this is interesting instead of instead of thinking this as F ofx to the G ofx we can actually do a little trick here it's the same trick I hope you remember this it's the same trick that we did with logarithmic differentiation the same idea only we can't just put Ln here's what we're going to do we're going to say hey you know what this good this was the same thing as this wasn't it yeah okay therefore this is the same thing as this do you believe it yes now what does that allow you to do with that g of X bring FR yes so then this becomes e to the G ofx Ln FX that's the idea here let me show you the way this works in practice I'm just going to give you the first U First little part we're going to call it good we'll we'll finish this problem up next time but so can you guys verify that right now I have Z to the zero not a good thing so what we're going to do instead is so we're going to write this as e to the Ln of x to the X only I'm not going to leave the X there what I'm going to do with the X so then this is limit X approaches Z from the right X Ln X are you okay with that one now there's one more interesting thing about this because E's continuous because e is that constant base continuous I can actually pull the e out of the limit this is equivalent to this instead of taking limit of e as that approaches I can do e of the limit as X approaches zero from the right of x l x so what that means is this listen carefully you ignore the E ignore the E just work on this limit figure it out and then put it back as an exponent B does that make sense to you so it's like a constant kind of like that e continuous so and and it's a constant base what that means is that uh the limit of e to a power is the same thing as the limit of the power and then take e to that power same thing so what we're going to do here is we're going to rewrite these things all three of these forms as something like this work on this limit I'll show you how to do that next time this by the way is uh 0 time infinity negative Infinity so we rewrite it using some of the stuff that we just did 0 * infinity and then put that as a power and that's all we've got to do does that make sense to you I'll show you more on that next time all right we're going to continue so what we're talking about in section 6.7 of course is the indeterminate forms and what we know is that if we have a limit of a rational expression somehow not even polinomial over polinomial just any sort of fraction where our limit is and we checked it we place number and we get 0 over 0 or we get infinity over infinity those two cases then we can do L tall's rule immediately we just take the derivative of the numerator we take the derivative of the denominator no big deal that's it so 0 over Z or Infinity over infinity of course one big thing we found out last time is we had to check that it doesn't work if it's not 0 over Z or Infinity over infinity does that make sense to you yeah now what we're doing here is we're discovering there's a few more indeterminant forms the last thing we did last time was Infinity minus infinity when you have that it's a really good idea to make one fraction because then most of the time it changes to Infinity over infinity or0 over zero remember that problem had a cosine in there I believe or if we have 0 times infinity okay rewrite one of them that way you have Infinity over infinity or 0 over Z no big deal now we're looking at some special cases of when we have a function of X raised to a function of X and one thing we learned the very last thing from last time was well if you have aun function of X ra to function of X we can always rewrite this just use e to the Ln remember that e to the Ln is a is an identity that gives you back exactly what you have I think I gave you this one last time 2 equal e to the Ln 2 every time that's the idea 2 to the X would equal e to the Ln 2x no problem that's basically the idea that we're doing here we're saying all right well if I have a function of X raised to function of X do this with it and I can move that function of X down front now as far as our limit goes that says that when we get something that we can't can't actually really do directly I mean think about that we always try to plug these in correct always so if we take our zero plug in zero what do you have Z to the we got that something looks just like that let's try this and let's see what we can do with it so this is the same thing as a limit as X approaches zero from the right of well it says that we're going to take e to the Ln this is this is just an identity statement that says you can write anything as e to the Ln of that thing e to the Ln x to the X now why do we do this what's it allow you to do again that that's the idea get rid of that exponent so we have a limit as X approaches Z from right e to the X Ln X now there was one more thing I told you last time I'm not sure if you remember I know we were kind of rushing because we only like two minutes left when we were doing this problem do you remember what I can do with the e that's right we don't really take it away the where it's gone forever but we take it away out of the limit absolutely so with this we can actually write it instead of the limit of e to this expression we can write e to the Limit of that expression so basically we're going to ignore that e for a little while no problem we're just going to look at the limit as X approaches zero to the right of x * L and X so should be okay with L now take take a look at the limit as X approaches Z of x l and x what do you get when you plug in Zero from the remember from the right means going this way it's going towards the left it's from the right what do you get here what do you get here you get zero what do you get here no you don't get one you get Negative Infinity that's correct so this is basically 0 time Infinity I'll give you a real big hint here if you ever get something like 0 to the 0o Ln of zero is going to become negative Infinity you're going to get something like 0 time Infinity what you're required to do here and this happens almost all the time with us okay what you're required to do is just rewrite this piece can we do 0 time Infinity no we can't do that that was one of those indeterminate forms we dealt with last time so rewrite just this little piece here's the idea the piece which is easier to take the derivative of you're going to move that to a denominator you're going to make it a denominator it's hardly ever the Ln hardly ever this it's typically this one let me show you what I'm talking about so again we can't do 0 * Infinity what we can do is 0 over Z or Infinity over infinity does that make sense so if I have 0 times infinity and I make the zero go to a denominator it's going to become another Infinity it's going to change 0 time Infinity into Infinity over infinity does that make sense to you so we're going to change the look of this a little bit by the way I know I already said it but you make a little mental note here we hardly ever change this guy the reason is you're going to see in a minute this would be hard to take a derivative of when it's on the dener this one is easy okay so check it out do we still have an e it's going to be there the whole time I would recommend to you that you keep on writing it uh that way you don't forget about it at the very end of your problem go my goodness how they're getting one I got zero okay so we got e limit don't forget the limit X approaches zero from the right leave the Ln X make make this thing become a fraction you can always make an expression become a fraction if you take it and put it under one so instead of X you could write this as 1 /x isn't this still technically can't can't you move that to the den the numerator from this denominator to the numerator then this is valid this is exactly the same thing show feel okay with that one now check out what happens this is going to make sense about what I just explained to you if I take zero now look at this if I take Zero from the right Ln of Z from the right is it negative Infinity you need to understand the look of the graph of Ln Ln looks like this does that okay so it's going NE INF as we approach Zero from the right it's going negative infity so this is negative Infinity over check this out look look what happens here if I take zero What's one over Z Infinity this counts by the way negative that's that's fine negative Infinity over infinity counts as Infinity over infinity hey can I use l talls r with this now yeah as soon as I change it to this that's great could I do it here there's not even a denominator how would you do that so make it have a denominator check it make sure you get Z over zero or Infinity over infinity do I have to switch any of this around do I have to switch any of this around heck no it's Infinity over infinity that's fine just start lal's rule from right here 0 over 0 or Infinity over infinity are you guys clear on that one mhm well let's do it so that was perfect now let's do our ly tall I still got an e nothing's going to change about that I still got a limit Zero from the right how we do L talls hopefully the last time I don't explain this we take the derivative of the numerator we take the derivative of the denominator is not a quotient rule so let's do the derivative of the numerator everybody derivative of Ln X cool okay so 1/x no problem how about the derivative of 1 /x all I heard what I'm hoping you said is yeah that's right I heard you that time you have to get attitude with me jeez so this derivative is 1x yes this derivative is negative do G see what's negative you think about this as X to the1 okay X11 goes down subtract one from the exponent it becomes -21 x s quick head out if you're okay with that one now before you go any further of course our idea is simplify before you do another or before you try another uh low tall or whatever you're going to do simplify these things so can you simplify this stuff of course so no ly TS rule we're just going to simplify e still there limit still there as X approaches zero from the right let's see this guy would become 1X time remember that when you have a complex fraction instead of division we can multiply by the reciprocal can you simplify that that's really nice yeah Negative X okay so we have now e to the Limit as X approaches zero from the right of x e to hey can we take that limit now can you do limit ofx as X approaches Zer from the right how much is it the Zer plug it in how much is it Z Zer so e to the this is why you don't forget to write the e I think I said it earlier if you're going man if you forget to write the e on all these things okay I just forgot to write it and then you're going to get zero you go wait a minute they're getting one in the back of the book how in the world are they getting one I'm getting zero well because you're forgetting the E you don't just take Ln we do e to the Ln so the E's got a be here and the E's got a B here and the E's got to be here making this a one interesting isn't it 0 to the 0o in this case is going to give us one should P be okay with that one good all right is it does it make sense cool tell you what we're going to only try two more these are a little bit more complicated I'm going try to give you some really difficult problems uh that way we we can work through them together and you can see all the ins and outs of all this stuff uh these are these are what I would consider to be Hardin question um when we simplify something like say were to simplify that and it didn't come out to be something as easy as X could we continue doing lall's rule or Absol look at lyall's rule works every time you have 0 over zero or some form of infinity over infinity Okie doie so as long as you still check that as long as it's still indeterminate you can do lals rule it's not just a oneandone all right so if you if it was didn't work out nice and you had like uh if you had one /x now you couldn't do LS rule there because it' be one over zero that would be Infinity you'd have e to the infinity it would be Infinity okay but you can do ly's rule as long as you simplify it and it's still or you can manipulate it and still Z over zero or Infinity over infinity are all the problems involving the E always going to turn out to be one nope no not all the time something um some a lot are some some are but some are so no okay let's give this a try I know this one's going to it's going to be a little bit more difficult that shouldn't be a problem for us I want you guys to kind of lead me on what you would do how you would think about this problem cuz right now honestly we only have two more examples so you guys should be kind of kind of pros at this at this point kind of understand what's going on what would you do first plug in and let's see if it works uh what's tan pi/ 2 from the left not to the left from the left this way what happens here say what positive Infinity that's right do you know the graph of tangent you have any idea what it looks like this is pi/ 2 from the left okay how about cosine of pi/ 2 we had to go from the left on that one because for tangent it would be undefined the limit wouldn't exist if I said the limit at pi/ two you can't do it because one does this one does this all right so I had to say from the left that that's defin that the cosine doesn't care uh because it's defined from the left it's defined from the right so therefore it's defined and both of them it goes both in each case cosine of 2 is what Z good so this is infinity to the zero is it one of the indeterminate forms that we can work with yes look over there is it one of the indeterminate forms that we can work with yeah now here's the idea if I didn't mention it before here's the idea we are always always trying to get this down to the form of 0 over Z or Infinity over infin now you help you understand that concept we can't do anything with this right now we can't do anything with that so we're going to work with it we're going to use probably this technique that's why I said try this for each of these cases try doing this it'll help you because if you can do this if you can rewrite it as Infinity over infinity or Z over zero then we can do a lby tals rule rule so we're always trying to work with these things to get them down to an indeterminate form which we can work with so changing this type of form into 0 over Z or Infinity over inity okay now that we have the idea tell me the next step please what would you want to do okay let's all do that you know what you could even do it right now if you get the hang of it you could write e to the Limit cine X Ln Tan x you guys see that that's what we're going to get ultimately I'm going to show you the steps but you could do it right now that's what I would do if if it was my paper I'd write e to the Limit cosin X Ln Tan x so e Ln 10x cosine X the two things we're going to do which is why I said this earlier if you get in the pattern of this because you're going to do it a lot okay this moves down all the time doesn't it that exp moves down all the time this e comes out all the time so we end up getting e outside of our limit to the Limit X approaches < / 2 from the left cosin x * Ln t x you know what every step that you do you got to check what type of form you're working with now so let's see if this works okay always be checking to see if it works uh pi/ two let's do this how much is that it's not going to change what's right we just want to check the form to see what we can and can't move so that's zero um how much is is that that's Infinity l l of infinity is still Infinity which one would well I'm sorry I I didn't I should ask you this what should we do now move one of them to the bottom move one of them to the bottom okay which one are we going to move to the bottom the Ln or yeah it's rarely the Ln because if you imagine this from over here if I move this to the denominator I'd get 1 over Ln X you with me mhm that's really hard to do 1 over lnx would take the derivative of 1 over Ln X that's going to get a little difficult okay we'd have a chain rule we'd have Ln X to the1 we bring 1 have -2 and then we have a chain Ru after that but it's possible it won't work out for you it's possible to do you can do the derivative of one L and X but it's not going to work out like this okie dokie so I'm just going to give you the hint here you're r if ever going to put this one on the denominator because you're going to get lots of chain rules that way does that make sense to you this one is the one we're going to move down we might get chain rule we might not but that one's going to be easier than l in most cases so we still have the E we still have a limit / 2 from the left we got Len we got Tan x see we got 1 over cosine X you guys okay with that so far so you can do that every time you say hey cosine x no no no let's just put it over one over cosine X it's it's the same idea now of course we can simplify this a little bit maybe we don't want to work with 1 over cosine X we might want to work with 1 cosine X is what let's call it secant okay now that we've done that now that we've done one more step let's check to see what typ of form we have hopefully this process it should work for you guys it should make it a z over Z or an Infinity over infinity let's see um now this shouldn't have changed from here this should be the same so when I plug in Pi / 2 tan from the left Tan x is still Infinity correct that means Ln of infinity is still in this is still Infinity see X as X approaches Pi / 2 remember that this is 1 / cosine how much is co remember it was this how much is cosine of pi 1 Z infity so this is infinity over some form of infinity can we do Lal rule right now then do it hey what are you going to have to do for your derivative of Ln t x what is that 90% of the time that's the correct answer that's right yay let's see if you knew what you were doing here uh ladies and gentlemen the derivative of Meers does not think goodness this is not a quoti rule uh what's the derivative of this guy X here How We Do derivative of Ln is one over the inside time derivative of inside so we have one over inside here's one over inside got it yeah times derivative of ins what's the derivative of tan X so we' have see s x over tangent X show can should be loc with that so far one over inside that's where we get the tan X on the denominator times derivative of inside that's our sec Square uh what do you think we should do now check to should we check it or should we simplify it yeah simplify it first before you start checking again and again let's simplify it so can you simplify that yes take a little side road here so we'd have sec^2 X over Tan x right times if you put this over one if you put that over one division is the same as multiplication of the reciprocal so we would multiply by what's what's going to be on the numerator one cool all right let's do it uh what's going to happen gone almost gone so we'll have X over tan^ 2 x you guys okay with that one yeah now here's a here's a here's an issue uh if you try to do the secant x that is going to give you infinity isn't it this is going to give you infinity you probably could do another Lal if you wanted however sometimes it's worth your while is that Infinity also Infinity Square so Infinity right also it's worth your while to simplify as much as you can so what I'm seeing here is that if I write this just a little bit different if I write this as SEC X look at tan^ 2 x is the same thing as coent squ sorry one over one over tan^ s x same thing asent s x are you with me on that one we use some identities here well what I'm seeing out of that one is that that I could do 1 / cosine x * cosine 2 X over sin^2 X this is our secant you guys follow me on that one this is cotangent squar you follow me on that one you with me still yeah can you simplify that yeah yeah why not let's do it cosine cosine s so yeah we did a lot of trig in this one I want to make sure that you guys are okay before I go on uh you okay that this is definitely true yeah and this is true true and this is the same thing as one/ cosine hey this same thing as remember if tangent is s over cosine cotangent is cosine over s so we have we have that simplify it now let's just pretend we have a limit out front if I do cine of Pi / 2 how much is cosine of Pi / 2 again how much is s of pi/ 2 again one I have 0 over one is it okay to have 0 over one then we've just evaluated our limit without having to do another lals rule does that make sense we kind of avoid this whole secant tangent thing and then two tangent see squar that that's that's ugly so make it Easy by simplifying as much as you can not just once as much as you can that a lot of times makes your problem that much easier did you guys understand that the concept here yes you probably could do another ly tall should you probably not probably simplify as much as you can so let's wrap this thing up we've got and E we've got a limit we got X approaching / 2 from the left and now we have well the only thing that we we did here's our star we we did our star and now we have cosine X over sin^2 X okay let's do it one more time you guys okay with going from here to here yeah what was cosine as we approach x 0 over so this would be e to the of course I said no it's not always one and then I gave you an example that was one again uh but just a coincidence okay so we get to the Z again we get one show hands feel okay with that one that's a tough problem It's Tricky that's a lot of stuff in that problem I look at all the steps we have in that would you like to try one more yes okay ideas don't change though ideas are if you have an indeterminant form try to work with it make it Z over zero or or Infinity over infinity and then you do Lal rule after you do Lal rule you simplify it every time after you simp simpy you check it again and if you still have Lo R cool if you don't then you value your limit that's simp right okay this one's going to take us a while too okay now you really need to tell me what to do okay what would you do first try try good let's do it let's plug in infinity and see what we get uh what's one over infinity what's 1 - 0 one and what's that go to so this is one to the infinity is that one of those indeterminate forms that I gave you in that little sheet so if it's that one what should we try e that e to the Ln thing why don't you do that go ahead and do the e to the Ln thing um notice I'm going to give you the shortcut right now of course you can write this out and then write this out but I'm going to do it in one step here uh when you get the hang of this this is absolutely fine just don't for oh my goodness don't forget about the E okay don't forget that e it's important so what I know is that I could write this as e to the Ln of this argument well well that's the same thing as pulling out the E having the same old limit having the X come down because I have an Ln of the inside okay I really do need to make sure that you guys are okay on going from here to here do you guys see that I'm basically doing the same thing only in one step show P you okay with that one okay that's everybody that's good good so same idea it's still e the Ln isn't it and this is still an exponent but I'm bringing it down okay now let's check it again nothing really should change I should have a one up there somewhere and I should have uh an Infinity that's still Infinity now this thing let's look at that that's going to change a little bit look what happens here here's an Infinity when I plug an Infinity here what what do I get Zer one- Z one how about Ln of one Z oh so I have Infinity time Z oh that's one of those indeterminate forms that I can actually work with isn't that kind of cool when we do the Ln it changes from that that that U that one to that Infinity that's cool so I'm sorry to the zero I'm Miss spoke which one would we want to move here the Ln or the X let's do that so go ahead and do that how do I move it do I just move the X to the denominator what do I do okay yeah that's that's the way that we can do that can you also say x the 1 or yeah you can I do that one because it's easy for me to see the limit of that sometimes I see X to ne1 oh that's hard for me to think I can do that again but you can yeah you can do that so let's make sure that we we actually have an indeterminant form we already figured out that this one's zero let's look at this one remember the zero came from here that's that's that's Infinity time Z so if I move an Infinity to a denominator the infinity changes from Infinity to another Z that's zero now I got zero over do you guys see the zero over zero yeah this is zero it's one Ln of one is zero over zero hey what can I do every time I get Z over zero why don't you go ahead and work on LS this is going to be a little interesting okay a lot of stuff going on here the denominator fairly straightforward we actually already did that one in one of the previous examples so when I have 1/x of course that's really x 1 as you said bring down the 1 subtract one from it put over the1 over the denominator of X2 you guys okay with the- 1/x^2 yes have you guys finished this one yes okay so derivative of Ln says hey one over the inside where you're not changing anything no problem one over the inside times the derivative of the now let's look at the derivative of the the derivative of 1 - one I haven't done this in a while but it's kind of nice so one over the inside times derivative of inside I want you to see what happens here so e limit X approaches Infinity we've got -1 /x^2 we''ve got 1 over 1 - 1X times what's the derivative of one what's the derivative of One X so if I have minus a negative that's going to become so this whole thing gives us 1 /x^2 hopefully you understand why the same reason this gives you 1x^2 we have minus a negative so basically it's 0 minus negative like that that's really the derivative der of 1 is z minus minus D of this thing hey it's the same it's 1x^2 so be okay with that one so what they gives us in the long run is positive and they cancel positive 1 x s okay cool theat probably simp probably simplify it I probably deal with this maybe do youall see that that's going to distribute across that denominator so we'll get big fraction 1 over looks like we get x^2 - x X2 there are other ways to do this by the way I'm just showing you one so x^2 - x this is -1x squ all right that looks a little better at least we have fraction over fraction we know that when we have a complex fraction like this instead of having the division we can always multiply by the reciprocal of the denominator all right well that's e man just some algebra now one over tell you what I'm going to do now what what am I going to do that factor out X I'm going to factor x that's right x * x -1 and I'm going to have x^2 over 1 division is the same thing as multiplication by the reciprocal so I'm going to reciprocate now I'm going to simplify what simplifies here and okay so this thing's completely gone this thing's almost gone and let's rewrite it let's see what we got remember the idea is do lal's rule simplify it rewrite it and then reevaluate what's on our numerator oh x x denominator I've got X okay check it out we're going to re-evaluate right now so take our Infinity plug it back in this is what we do every time right every single time we reevaluate hey what's uh Negative X is X approach to Infinity infity this is negative Infinity that's right what's this as X approaches Infinity okay what's infinity minus one like little kids I'm better than you by Infinity I'm better than you by infinity plus one okay that's still Infinity that counts it's an Infinity over an Infinity what are you going to do now and that's should answer your question can you do it more than once of course you can anytime you have listen just because it has an e on it it doesn't matter it's still a limit right it still falls into the whole idea of if it's Infinity over infinity do a littley talls with it so we've got e to the limit of x approaching Infinity uh everybody derivative oh this is so nice goodness gracious how much is that over so this is going to equal e to the1 or Z so we our final answer you want to be in the notation of that whatever answer this is literally exactly what you have every single step this is what you should have so you should have writing it as uh e with your your function of X moving forward than Ln you should be showing me all this work you should be showing me this stuff our simplification getting down to here then you go okay uh this right here this is still you write a limit because when you do the lital rule that's your your resultant of that this is your derivative it is negative one the derivative of this is one and then you go well hey a derivative sorry a liit of a constant is the constant so no big deal it just happens to be that limit of1 is1 e to the1 just want to read that's it sure feel okay with that does it make sense this whole idea that's kind of a tough one right there's a lot going on on that problem but do you have any questions at all question on the second Arrow right here can you just like 1/x^2 over the one overx can you just cross like cancel those both out cuz they're products of each other these ones yeah yeah you could do that that's what I said there's a couple different ways that you can can actually do this uh that would work out I I think the same actually might be even a little bit better cuz if you did this multiply by the reciprocal these are gone this thing right here this becomes negative this thing right here is zero right 1 0 is one you just get negative 1 so yeah same thing I did want to show you this way that way you understand because we had a question earlier uh can you do a lowol rule again even if you have an e the answer is yes in this case you do in the other case you wouldn't have to just like we had over here could you have yes did we have to no so we probably could have made this a little bit easier absolutely uh but there's multiple ways to to do these um my suggestion would be simplify as much as you can I probably didn't do that um here probably could have simplified that and made it just a little bit quicker we okay with that one yes sir this would be a great time for questions are there any other questions at all so do you know what I mean by indeterminate form of limits indeterminate forms of limits what are you try what's your goal what are you trying to get once you get Z over zero or Infinity over infinity what do you use that's right that makes that makes these limits so much easier than any other way that we have okay that lit's rule is lal's Rule a quotient rule oh my goodness that'd be harder this is just derivative of the numerator over derivative of the denominator we look at the comparison of the derivatives of the functions rather than the comparison of the function themselves and limits end up being the same [Music] um last thing are you okay that we can always do e to the L of a function and it's still exactly the same okay that's the idea well we always see it not 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 7.1:  Integration By Parts
[Applause] okay so time for new chapter time for new section section 7.1 um so far what you know about integrals is that you can basically do two things if it fits your integration table you are good to go if it doesn't fit your integration table the only thing that you can do with it is what sub to make it fit that's right substitution to make it fit the table right now in chapter 7 we're going to learn a whole lot of other integration techniques that you haven't learned before unless you've had this class before that you haven't learned before so have you ever wondered um there's a substitution that's kind of like the chain rule right yeah substitution is like the opposite or inverse of chain rule have you ever wondered why there's not a product rule there's a product rule for Drew is in there yeah is there a product rule for integrals not that I know not that you I want to show you something uh do you know what that is a product rule from product rule I'm going to prove something for you and we're just going to start with what the product rule is and we're going to try to undo it so notice that we've got a derivative and the derivative equals derivative of the first * the second plus the first time der to Second that's your your basic old product rule now what's the inverse of a derivative let's integrate both sides we can actually do this you can integrate both sides of an equation so if we integrate this DX and integrate this DX then what we end up getting is the integral of the derivative of f ofx * G ofx DX and over here we got the integral of fime of x g of X Plus FX * G Prime of X you guys okay with that so far yeah just take an integral on both sides now let's see what happens here what is going to happen here if I take the integral of a derivative going to do it so yeah calculus tells us that they are inverses so if I take the integral of a derivative DX DX that's gone all I'm going to have is f ofx * G ofx does does that make sense to you are you sure now the next thing I'm going to do I'm just going to separate this notice that with integrals you can separate by addition or subtraction so I'm going to do that I'm going to have the integral of fime of x g of X DX plus the integral of f ofx time G Prime of X DX so we had product rule I take an integral both sides no big deal derivative is gone integral and derivative they basically do each other their inverses I have just the functions themselves f * G here we know this was product rule if we break up our integral after doing integral on both sides we have one integral we got two integrals you guys with me I'm going to solve for this one I'm going to put this on one side basically I'm just going to subtract that guy does that make sense yeah okay so if I do then we've got integral of FX * G Prime of X DX equals I'm going to keep this and if I have subtracted that I'll have frime of X time G ofx are you guys okay with the algebra on that one I want I'm going slow that I want to make sure you really do follow do you follow it there's only one more thing that I'm going to do what I'm going to do right now I'm just going to switch these two guys around so by the by the commutativity of multiplication this is not a problem I'm going to put G of X before frime of X you okay with that one so integral of f ofx time G Prime of X DX equals let's see F ofx got that time G of x no problem minus integral of G ofx * fime of X DX okay I want to show man feel okay with that so far now that's just some algebra after doing a little bit of calculus all we did was do an integration on both sides what in the world does it all mean well I'm going to show you because right now it's a little hard to understand we're going to use some symbols right now to represent some of these uh these functions so what we're do is we're going to call U we're going to call F ofx U and we're going to call G of x v please keep in mind u and v are going to represent functions in your integral right now they're going to represent some functions here so we're letting U represent the function of x x v uh V represent the function G of x a function of X you guys okay with that so far yeah now we got some other things besides just f ofx and g of X don't we I mean we could change this to a u right now are you with me we could change this to a u we could change this to a v we could change that to a v you with me however we've got an F Prime and we've got a g Prime so what we're going to do is go okay cool well tell you what let's just do like a du let's do a derivative on both sides if I do this just like your substitutions do inte sorry derivative of U is R du derivative of f is frime of X ah DX do you remember doing that yeah just like a substitution well here we'll get DV and we'll get G Prime of X DX you still okay with it now look every one of these pieces is now part of this this little box of knowledge let's do a substitution instead of f ofx what do we call it no f ofx is just U what is this piece G Prime of X that's our D so this is DB F ofx was u g Prime of X DX D DV you guys okay with that so far yeah equals equals uh what's our F ofx again U what's our v v so f ofx is U time G of X is V minus integral uh what's our G of X now this is kind of cool what's our frime of X DX this whole piece so if we integrate the product rule what we end up getting is this thing right here what this thing is is how to do integration by parts just like the product rule is a Formula right it's just like the product rules of form it's been proven but just like the product rules of formula integration by parts is also a formula and even though it looks a little like what in the world are we doing I'm going to give you some easy ways to do some of these integrals you guys want to see how this stuff works yes first did you see how the formula comes about I don't want to just give you that CU like what in the world this stems from the product it's an easy proof but that stems from the product rule let me show you why we do this so so integral of x * Eed X DX so this right here What's this called again integ maybe write that this is integration by parts so when I say do integration by parts or when the book says do integration by parts or your best friend says at one of your parties hey can you do some integration by parts like yeah duh I know what that means that'd be the best party ever by the way so my kind of party so let's look at this for a second think through all the things you know about integrals does that fit your integration table the way it is this would that'd be easy that would that'd be easy but this can you use a substitution no if you pick this to be you the derivative is one does it get rid of the X no that's a problem so will a substitution work here no there's no way to do this integral for us right now we had to create something new that would take care of it and this is what we have you see when you have a product here we use the product rule sometimes when we have products here we can use for integrals integration by parts which is really really cool let me show you how how this works and let me show you what you should be picking for U and for V by the way it's it should be really apparent whether you pick the the correct thing or not uh within about the first step or two all right so here's how in general you choose how you're you and how you choose your be so couple little notes I want you to choose U so that you can take the integral of whatever V is basically the integral of the rest it'll make sense in just a second I'm going write out the notes right now write them down I'll explain them so choose U such that or so that the integral of V is actually possible and try to pick U this doesn't always work but this is a good indication try to pick U so that the derivative of U is better so that's smaller or easier to work with so choose you so that the integral of V firstly is possible because you're going to have to take the integral of V also again try to pick U so and so that the derivative of U is better bet I'm I know that's not mathematical but better as in you reduce the power uh it get becomes smaller it goes away completely something like that so here we go I want you to look at this this integral with me there's two parts to this there's an X part and there's an e to the X part you with me okay if I if I pick U to be e to X is the derivative of e to the X better no no it's still e DX I could take the integral of x that's okay but if I pick X what's the derivative of x is that better yes yes one is better than x isn't it I think so I'd rather work with one than x seems better also can you do the integral of e x then that's our appropriate uh pick appropriate choice for you so here's how we do this it's going to take some getting used to but here's how it works pick U so that you can take the integral of the rest your V and pick U so that hopefully the derivative of U is going to be better easier to work with do you follow that so in our case we're going to pick U equal x here's what b equals it's really easy to find there's an easy way to do it uh what's your U cover up with your hand V is all the rest of it so V is the integral of e tox DX the reason why we have that is because we're going to have to deal with the integral at some point we have to have our V equals the integral of the rest uh we need to be getting let's see what are we trying to get there we want to be able to find our V for this guy we got to have that so can you do your just like you're doing a substitution can you do your du how much does your du equal yes okay V was the integral of the rest can you do the integral of e to X how much is it don't worry about the plus C right now don't worry about the plus C right now we're going to deal with the so what no we're just right here we're we're not doing a derivative we're saying V is the integral of the rest okay we're not doing derivatives here we're actually doing the integral of of this thing so V is the integral of the rest that's what V is so okay do the integral of that V is now e to the X you with me okay cool um man do we have the parts do we have What U equals do we have what V equals do we have what equals same thing yes do we have what du equals put in the formula so what our integral is then is U * V minus the integral notice there's another integral you do integration twice here one to find the V and then again in your Formula E to the X I'm sorry what was what was the DU DX that's the idea I need to make sure this makes makes sense to you so we picking we're picking you so that the derivative becomes easier and you can do the integral the rest the easy way to do this identify what your U is cover up with your hand V equals the integral of the rest that's what V is for us it's that's the easy way to do it after that well find the derivative of U Dera of X du equal DX in this case is a really easy one do the integral of whatever you had left over so that's e x now put it in the formula integration by part says integral of UV = U * V minus the integral of V du DX in this case now can you do that integral yes how much is it so we get x * e tox minus what this when you finish that last integral that's where you do the plus C you see you could get a constant here you could um but we don't need to because you're saying integral of constant plus a constant just get another constant so we'd have a plus c here guys right with that one tell me one more thing that we could do change it again we could Factor an e to the X if you a lot of times e x you can Factor it so what we know is the integral of x e to X DX actually equals x e x - e x + C or E X * x -1 plus C either one of those things show hands if you can follow that one you're probably need some more practice right yeah okay cuz right now this is only the first this is about the easiest that we can do uh they get a lot more intense I should say not really any different ideas same idea if you can't do a substitute by the way when you're doing integrals don't jump immediately to integration by parts go through your list if it fits integration table that's the easiest and you just do it if it doesn't you try what first subtitution please try substitution because if you can do a substitution that'll be easier after that then you try stuff like integration by parts then you try a trig sub trigonometric substitution which we haven't covered yet we're going to cover that in this chapter but that's later on so let's try few more examples we're going to start building these up to more and more intensity that way you get used to doing some of these problems I don't want to give you just like spoon feed you and then on your test just Hammer you with some hard ones so we're going to do some hard ones here in a little while but I want to get you used to this first so how about I'm also going to try to make some mistakes mes um that way you can you can see the appropriate choices and when you will realize that you've made the wrong choice does that make sense to you you go oh man that's what happens when you make the wrong choice here so okay we'll take a look at it now the first thing we always check for what is it when we check integrals what do we check for we check to see if it's actually in the table first is that in your table heck no most of them aren't going to be okay otherwise it' be really easy uh after it's not in your table what do you try to do now you try to do a Uso is a u substitution going to work here if I pick this the derivative is X squ you see X squ anywhere no if I pick this that's 1 /x you see a one over X anywhere no the substitution is not going to work okay well if a substitution doesn't work our next go-to this is the the the model of thinking that you do okay does it fit the table if it does awesome if it doesn't Okay substitution does it fit substitution if yes cool that's that's pretty easy if not dang it then we got integration by parts it'll still work it's just a little bit more work so go through and try to pick the appropriate thing the appropriate factor for your integration by parts so we got two choices again for our U our U could either be X cubed or it could be Ln x what would you pick for your U uh 3 x why not X Cub let's think about I want to show you though check this out let's say that I picked uh you can write this down or not I don't I don't really care let's say you picked = X cubed you with me if you pick = X Cub can you please tell me what your V would be no it's not just LX it's the don't forget that integral my goodness don't forget that it's the integral of lnx DX it's all of the rest of the stuff does that make sense you're basically just covering up the U the U is one part this is your u v equals all of the rest of the stuff so V equals quote unquote the rest show hands if you feel okay with that it's a big deal all right now could you take the derivative of this yeah we can take the derivative darn near anything and that actually makes it easier for this one uh can you take the integral of Ln X you can what is it okay I'm not asking for the derivative I'm asking for the integral the derivative of L and X is 1 /x what's the integral of L and x e no it's not [Music] e well I don't know what is it can you do it can actually then if you can't do it then we' picked the wrong thing does that make sense you need to pick listen listen listen this is not a trivial Point here uh you need to pick U so that hopefully the U becomes better the DU makes it better but if not okay the main thing here is that you can actually do the integral of V because if you can't then you're stuck none of you right now unless you've had this class before know what that integral is do you know what the integral of Ln X is no you don't so we made the wrong choice this is a bad choice well if that's the bad choice don't beat yourself up over it just erase the problem and pick the different thing what should our U actually be okay what you said all along genius so if U equals Ln X can you please write down what the V is going to equal oh that' be 3 no it wouldn't be 3 too much too we still got an integral don't we uh listen I'm not lying to you all you do is cover this up uh sorry cover that up your you and write the rest whatever you see that's what goes for your V even Rhymes don't you love rules at rhyme whatever you see is what goes for your V whatever stupid I should edit that I'm not going to watch yeah I feel Victorious right now can you take the derivative of this guy okay what's the derivative of Ln hey the only thing where the derivative equals the integral is when you're deal with e x okay that's that's it l and X is different so we get 1/x ah good now with the V we're not doing derivative here we're actually solving this integral can you do the integral of x 3r then we picked the correct Choice here okay the other choice didn't work this choice we get X to 4th over 4 or 1/4 x 4 I don't care how you put that we don't need a plus c cuz we're just using this in our formula right now we have the plus C at the very very end should be okay with that one and do you understand why we picked the U the way we did good that's important that's the hardest part of this is picking the U correctly honestly it is the rest of it is a Formula which you know how to do you know how to do easy integrals you know how to do you know do all sorts of derivatives you're good to go just use the formula so what the formula says is that the integral of U DV equal U * V minus the integral of V du just plug in the pieces watch this real careful though make sure you plug in the pieces correctly can you please tell me what the U is good right here that's our that's r u times RV do the V that you actually solve for don't integral again what's the v x you guys okay on the U * the V we got a minus sign put a minus sign we got an integral sign put an integral sign put the V here again the V goes in two spots V goes here V goes here now stick with me Ln x x 4 4us sign got it so Ln x x 4 4us sign integral integral x 4 4 again that's our V now look at your du your du is not always DX your du depends on what you picked for your U what's your du so we need 1 /x DX it's different than substitution it's different you don't start solving for the DX here the formula says you're going to take this and put this whole thing where this is you don't start solving for that like like some people do like I do for substitutions so if your U is Ln X put that if your V is x 4 four put that minus no problem integral no problem V is X4 4 put that du is 1x DX show hands if you understand the concept good now simplify it solve it this should be solvable if it's not solvable listen carefully please if this isn't solvable it's the only piece of calculus you have left right if that's not solvable for you if you can't do that try a substitution we'll try another integration by parts if this thing explodes way bigger than this thing then you've picked the wrong choice and try the other substitute try the other U okay so you shouldn't be making these way way worse they should start getting better smaller powers and things like that okay or a doable integral this one actually get the same power back but we can do the integral so in our case we got Ln x * x 4 4 minus the integral what are you going to do with all this stuff tell me something you can do combine combine how much we get x 4 4 not X to 4th x to the 3r yes and then we can also do what bring the4 out maybe 1/4 out front would be a good idea hey does that look like something you can do yeah I sure hope to goodness that you can I mean that's that should be easy one you guys okay with the algebra on that one yeah 1/4 comes out x to the 4th you should know how to simplify here yeah so let's uh keep after it this one I'm going to write a little bit different CU I don't like having my lnx first so I'm going to write 14 x to 4th Ln X yall okay that that's the same thing 1/4 x to 4 Ln xus 1/4 hey look at that now we can do an integral of something that's really really really easy what's the integral of x to the 3 in fact we already did it yeah I now is where you put your plus C is the plus C important yes so don't forget it okay so don't do all this work and then go I'm done no you're not done put the plus C uh let us know that that that happens so 1/4 x 4th Ln x no problem minus 116th see where that comes from yeah yes no everybody x 4 let's see could you do some other things with it factor out X do a lot of things with this okay you could Factor an x to the 4 you can actually Force this thing to factor out a u a 116th or 1/4 or a six you could factor out a lot of stuff here so if you did it's going to look a little different so keep in mind when you look in the back of your book if it looks different they might have just started factoring things so don't give up on it um if you're if you a man I think I'm right try factoring something see if you can see a common factor that they have okie dokie so if you feel okay with that one can we build it up just a little bit Okie doie okay I'm going to change this problem slightly in just a moment but I want ask you a question first uh what do you check first when you're doing in your table table Okay good does it fit your table no next you check for will a substitution work here look again will a substitution work here absolutely cuz the derivative of this is 6x2 you see it your X's are gone so if I gave you this problem this is this is my whole point which some of you obviously didn't listen to my whole point is do not jump automatically to that that's silly okay try a substitution if it'll work here don't do this problem I told you I'm going to change it in a minute so this this would be great for you U equals this Dera of 6x2 x s are gone you pull out a 1 16 you're you're basically done you're going to get Negative cosine 1 16 negative cosine of 2x Cub them right plus C done easy will the substitution work now no no no so what are we going to do uh the next one you always check a substitution before you check integration by parts I hope that I'm getting through to you right now I'm getting through to you right now always check that because it'll make it easier if it'll work so oh man uh let's see here what's a good choice what do you think 2 sin 2x well 2 if we pick say what now if we pick s 2x uh as your U does the derivative get better no no and the integral grows right s thir okay so in your next process you would have you have a COS sign somewhere and you'd have an x to the 3 your integral is going to explode a little bit does that make sense I'll show you if you want I think we have time for this if you did don't don't write this in well I'm going to leave it up here but you can if you want I guess if you did this oops that would be it wouldn't it U integral the rest be so that would be D equal 2 cosine 2X DX do you know why I have a two out front X 3r over 3 then i' have UV minus integral of V du this is my du yeah do you see what I'm talking about right when you do this you should give up not calculus all right but right when you see this look what happened look look at honestly look this is basically the same thing but my power grew it didn't get smaller it grew is that a good thing no then this is the wrong thing to do so don't try to manhandle this problem and pound it into submission because it's going to kick your butt all right this thing's going to get worse if you pick this again well then that's going to go to a four and then that's silly so we don't want to do that so this is a bad choice you understand why it's a bad choice integral got worse not better even though you could do the integral of this one this derivative didn't look better you want you want both you want both really you want the derivative to be better and you want to be a to do the integral so let's try the other one instead of this being U let's pick that one being U then V equals cover integral of the rest du equals this is easy part dual 2dx you guys okay with the D equal 2dx yeah now listen you should be able to do this other thing this other integral uh can you do this integral you might have a u substitution in there so if you do a simple U sub I wouldn't pick you because you already have a u i pick like a w or whatever you want uh anything that you want besides x v and U right now now so if you picked a w substitution = 2x DW = 2 DX DW / 2 = DX and then do your substitution what you're going to end up with after you do this a whole lot is you're going to understand that really what this V is going to be is negative cosine 2x/ 2 is what that's going to be did you guys see where the over two is coming from yes the over two is coming from when you have your U or Well w = 2x DW = 2 DX DW oh look at that over two that's where the over two is coming from no I blow your minds did you follow that yeah do I need to do the whole thing for you no 12 cosine W ah W is 2x that's that it's open okay now wees so we've done our U we've done our V let's put this thing together in the formula the formula should look do you tell me what's the first thing I should write here good time what I'm going to eras this yeah show should be okay with that one so far yes yes guys in the middle oh yeah abely clean it up before we go any further that's nasty all right let's make this uh - 12x^2 cosine 2X - 12 x^2 cosine 2X let's do a couple things here let's pull out this negative and make that a plus let's pull out this two and simplify it with this two can you guys see that yeah twos are gone let's make it plus integral cine 2X time x DX you could even if you want to move the X out front right here x cosine X that might look a little bit better let's change that so x cosine 2X okay want your hands you okay with algebra on that one now calculus is done just like you follow your DDX with derivatives follow your integral form for integrals so here can you do that inal yeah you can is it in integration table H is a substitution going to work yeah yes okay what's the derivative of 2x so you need another Parts you need an X right would this work yes if it's a square is a substitution going to work here no oh my God okay so we did is it in the table will a substitution work what's your next choice you can do it again now don't screw this up pick the same thing for you that you did here the same thing it should be reduced by a power do you see that this is basically the same except instead of X squ you get X that's how you know you done it right okay this should at least go down a power if it goes up a power you pick the wrong choice if it goes down of power you pick the right choice you just got to do it again so let's do it again lots of practice so we're going to hang on to this okay we're going to look just right here uh what's the and we got to move quickly what's the appropriate U check this out when that's X see how when we take a derivative the power drops doesn't it 2 to one 1 to zero that means that our next integral would be very easy or next integral would be possible at least so V would equal the integral cover it integral of whatever's left cine 2x DX I'm going to do this inter real quickly I'm not going to show you the substitution like here do you see that you're going to have another substitution here U or W or whatever is going to be 2x that means DW is going to be 12 DX that means we're going to get an over two so this would be S of 2x over 2 can you verify that for me sin 2x but then over two by the subtitution rule okay so I would not write this again right now I'm just going to hang on to it I'm just going to focus right here so I'm going have a plus big old Stuff Plus well we're going to have U * [Music] v u * V minus the integral of V du now what's our DU in this case that's nice that means that we're not going to have any extra work to do I want you to see if you're okay okay with this so I know I'm going about a minute or two over but this is kind of important for us you okay with the U the U the U is DX now you okay with the v v is integral the rest pretty easy integral you need to be able to take these integrals otherwise you made the wrong choice now we got U * vus integral of v and then du du is DX make that substitution again tell me something we're going to do with this okay so if we do that we get some stuff plusx sin 2x minus the integral oh yeah 12 integral sin 2x DX only we've already basically done that one look at this this integral is that integral so just look back at your table we've already done it so we have all the same stuff minus 12 this again was cine 2x/ 2 exactly what we have here this integral is the same as this one so cosine 2X over 2 so F be okay with that one now we're just going to clean it up okay just cleaning this thing up we've got all that nasty stuff was NE 12x^2 cosine 2X plusx sin 2x what happens here cancel not canc plus cosine 2X and last bit okay I want to make sure you're clear Before I Let You Go this is the first little part it's right there do you guys okay on that one from the first interation by Parts this was the first part of our second integration by parts the U * V this little piece this plus comes from when we do our last integral minus and negative becomes a plus 1/4 cosine 2X plus see oh my gosh look what happens to the powers Square to the first Power no X at all that happens a lot when you have this if you add x to the 3 power you'd have to do that one more time you had to the fourth power you have to do it one more time ultimately we're going to find a reduction formula for that we're going to create our own formula for this what I want to know is if that actually made I know this is kind of sloppy I didn't have room over here but do you understand that this is the plus one for so P if this made sense to you good all right so for our today for our day today we're going to practice more integration by parts so if you don't remember from last time no we've got a weekend in between this uh except for people watch online they have like 5 seconds in between this so for us though what we're talking about uh is integration by parts and the way we do integrals is first thing we check for is do we have something that's in the integration table if we do it's really easy it's in the table if it's not then we try a substitution once we try a substitution well hopefully we can do one if we can't we can do it because it's easier if we can't then we have now integration by part so we check this is this in an integration table for us no of course not will a substitution work no no if I substitute this part there's no other e to X in there if I substitute this well there's no it's not going to take care of the E tox if I do sign there's no cosine up there remember with substitutions the derivative of your U has to be somewhere in your integral that doesn't happen here so what we're left with is an integration by parts now these last four examples that we're going to do today um they are they're like the the more difficult Concepts the more difficult ideas the ones like wow I didn't know you could actually do that with this stuff I'm going to show you some really cool interesting things that you can do with inte ation by parts are you ready for it yeah so here's what I'm going to do I'm going to pick U to be Sin Sin 2x now as soon as you pick U what's v so I pick you we got to be able to be pretty good about finding out what V is what's v very good everything else so you just cover this up with your hand write exactly what's left over in this case integral of BX DX quick head notot if you're okay with that one so this is coming back to you I hope right now the way that we pick U is typically U becomes easier and you can do the integral of the V well in our case this integral is going to be really easy isn't it this one doesn't get any better but you're going to see something really unique that happens on these types of problems where we get when you think about it we're going to get repetitiveness here aren't we the integral of e DX is e x integral or the derivative of sinx is cosine X and the derivative of that one is is sinx we're going to get things back again no matter what we choose does that make sense to you so watch what can happen here if we do this then du = 2 cine 2x DX can you please explain to me where this two comes from hey and V equals do I need to plus C right now no no we're going to wait to the very end to put a plus c quick head now if you're okay with that one now what we do with our our integration by parts is we pick our U do a derivative we pick our V we do the integral of whatever's left over that's the V is the rest then we do integral of vdal U * V so in our case our integral is going to equal U time B minus the integral of B now now this is what's interesting minus integral of V but then we got to have du how much is our DU in this case so we need this whole thing right here okay so let's make sure you guys got it U * v u * V minus okay integral of V integral of V du is this whole piece quick head now if you're okay with that one yeah now check it we did this last time we saw we saw something similar to this last time I'm going to move my e x to the front by the way so e x sin 2x the last example that we did by the way what else can I do here two out two out yeah we're going to take that two out because it is a constant being multiplied e to x cosine 2X DX if you think back if you watch back on the video for the last example that we did do you remember the last one we did we had something kind of similar to this one we worked it down except instead of sin 2X and edx it was like an X squar remember that and we had to do integration by parts twice do you recall that example well look at this one doesn't that look almost exactly the same as that except instead of sign we're going to have cosine could we do integration by parts again yeah let's do it again now if you're thinking wait a minute wait if I do integration by parts here and it gets this Plus something looks almost exactly the same as that why are we doing that and aren't I going to get something like this but something looks just like this again yeah but that's the whole point and I want to show you why so we're going to leave this thing alone and we're going to look right here here's the whole thing if you pick U equal s of 2x what are you going to pick for U here pick the same thing so now U = cosine 2X not this I'm sorry not the exact same thing but pick uh the the same part that you picked so if you picked s of 2x for this one pick cosine of 2x for this one V again is the integral of e to X DX that's pretty easy so U cosine 2X no problem V is just the integral of the rest du help me out with the DU what's the DU going to be why negative because the good negative sign so this is going to give us negative sign the chain rule is going to give us a two so we're going to have -2 sin 2X and V is going to equal that's pretty easy the integral of e x is e x show hands feel okay with that one so far good deal now we're going to wrap this thing up so here we go we got e x we got s 2x we got Min -2 we got min-2 you guys okay with that so far now please watch carefully when you're doing this integral this is- 2 * this whole thing isn't it so if we just start writing out stuff willy-nilly we're probably going to make some sign errors here so what we're going to do is hey if this integral is going to be U * vus integral of V to U put a bracket here because what's going to happen is we're going to be Distributing that -2 throughout this this problem does that make sense yeah okay so minus two no problem now our integral what are we GNA write first e u * V so yeah you could write cosine 2X * e x or e x time cosine 2X it doesn't matter it's U * V so I'm going to write e to X cine 2x U * V we just have it in backwards order minus the integral of what what's going in here that's our V and then oh V 2times -2 sin 2x I forgot something do you see what I forgot my DX DX sorry I forgot my DX let's double check to see if I'm right we go like a 10-second recap to make sure that you guys got it so we're looking here it doesn't fit our table we can't do a substitution we're going to try integration by parts we picked something all right cool we'll pick this one u v is the rest derivative of U is this guy by Chain rule integral of V is this guy no problem we do U * vus the integral of V du and we start over again we simplify see if we can move anything outside of our integral this part calculus is done this part Min - 2 integral okay we get something real similar well let's pick the same type of idea here let's pick cosine 2X is our U okay V is the integral of the rest remember we're not worried about our minus 2 that's outside of our integral V integral of e X DX okay derivative of cosine 2X we can do that -2 by the chain R sin 2x DX V is exactly the same as it was before so again we have it we have U * vus the integral of v and then another du you guys okay with that one let's simplify some of this stuff let's see what's going on so what can I do here let's do that so I'm going to get e to X sin 2X x- 2 big old bracket I'm going to get e x cosine 2X plus plus 2 integral e to X sin 2x DX lots of X by the way I like to go slow on these ones because the worst thing you can do here is mess the sign up that would really screw this problem does it make sense to you so Don't Mess the signs up here so we're going to go slow we're going to make sure this is right um what else can I do here I don't want to factor anything I want to get rid of these brackets how do I do that dist if I do that if I distribute that then what we end up getting is something really long e to X sin 2x let's see - 2 e x cosine 2X yeah minus 4 that's very good because we're going to distribute Min -4 integral e to X sin 2x DX no more brackets I want to know if mathematically you can make it there in your head you feel okay with that one show hands if you do now did we do anything great on this problem what it looks like is that do you see what happened do you see this we started here right you started there mhm we did all this junk in fact we did the jump twice and we got down here and this is exactly like what we started with so you go dang do it what are we GNA do we can do it again if we do it again keep getting that that's what was that Einstein's definition of insanity or something like that I don't know who it was but said doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result uh if we do this again unless your math was completely wrong you're probably going to get the same thing again and again and again does that make sense to you so this is a problem so what are you going do about it we're going to be smart about it check this out here's what we know we know that this this integral equals this part do you believe that yeah check this out so what we know is that the integral don't lose me here this is the important part this is easy you can do this everybody can do this right now this is the interesting part this is why we're doing this problem right now so we've got integral e x sin 2x I'm so excited I'm almost shaking going to be so much fun not really but it's it's going to be fun I'm not shaking now this thing equals we have equals the whole way down equals this whole enormous piece of junk okay you know you've been being recorded right s it's okay you should apologize to the people I don't think they care they care I care maybe they'll get excited to B in India you're Bing my people in India goodness okay that's long enough what I want to know is do you understand this is true we did the integral of this it equal this whole mess of junk let's make sure I didn't miss anything do I have all the numbers and stuff right pretty sure okay do you believe that we have equation here do you believe that you can do anything you want to as long as you do it to then what if we do this we go wait a second uh this part looks great to me this part looks not so much but what if I were just to take that and add that oh man I know right oh my God here's the whole cool part about this if you get a piece of your integral back again like the same thing you guys see how we got the same exact thing back again what can we do shoot just add it to both sides that's going to get rid of that integral so let's see uh we have one of them here I just added four of them how much do I have I have five of them so we're treating this thing like the equation that it actually is so 1 + 4 = 5 * integral e tox sin 2x DX equal well this is awesome I have e to X I've got sin 2x- 2 e to x cosine 2X what happened to this gone I added it over completely gone so the whole idea here is this well maybe you're not on the wrong track maybe you're actually on the the completely right track you just get the same exact thing back and go wait a minute man I blew this thing up no no you did it right so if we have all but the last integral and the last integral is exactly what we started with just add it to both sides like this shoot hey we have minus 4 just add four add four times the integral of this whole thing it's going to get rid of it just like if you had Min - 4x and you add 4X hello it's gone add it to both sides here's five we only have to do one more thing we got to get rid of this five how do you do it divide five divide by five so I'm going to do a couple things right now first thing I'm going to do is factor out my e to the x no if that's possible so over here if I factor that out I got e to X sin 2x - 2 cosine 2X so just factored out my edx and then if I wanted to get the five over there I do what now I divide by five I divide by five then I end up getting 1 so our integral of e x sin 2x DX what we wanted to find out we know since we divided by five this is gone we get 1/5 over here5 e DX sin 2x - 2 cosine 2X one thing I'm missing what am I missing plus do the plus c oh my gosh wasn't that cool is that kind of exciting it's interesting isn't it well how are we going to do it well if you get the same thing back again addable sides then all you have to do is divide this addition gets rid of the inle that you can't do you can't do that by itself you got to do it this way so if you just add to both sides you're done just divide by five and we're good to go so feel okay with that one isn't that kind of interesting that's cool right any questions or comments I got to erase this whole thing right now because it's these problems uh besides the next one are going to take up the entire board so uh each every time the next one might even take it more than the entire board question so the only time you would do that like add to the other side is when you get the same thing back twice you do Parts twice I don't know if it's twice but if you get it back again and there's one integral and it's exactly like what you started with why wouldn't you do that you know if it's exactly the same you go wait a minute I just got back the same thing either I did it completely wrong or this is perfect because I'm just going to add that to both sides and divide by the whatever the the constant is the coent do that because you have two uh looping terms would it matter if you switch the Ed the X and the coine I don't think so and I haven't done it I think I did it a long time ago I don't think it matters uh my point here was to pick the same thing though pick sinx pick cosine X if you did e to the X you could do the integral of sin 2x no problem uh you just have to pick that again I think this is a better way but I I haven't done it uh the other way I I like this way because it worked out really nice I have to worry about integrals uh that's why I picked did because integral ofx is very easy question if this was on if this was a homework problem is that what our answer would look like that is your answer okay other questions all right can we try another one yeah I asked you a while back when we were doing one of these things it was integration by parts and I said uh hey what are you going to do if I give you a problem like I don't remember what it was I think it was something like like uh X Ln X or something like this remember that so what are we going to pick and some of you guys said well let's pick U equal lnx said really so uh or sorry um U equal x and V would equal the integral lnx and said well do you know what the integral of Ln X actually is do you know what the integral of Ln X is no we don't well now what I'm going to do is instead of asking you this problem or something similar I'm going to ask you this problem what is the integral L I'm asking for integrals not derivatives Hulk angry just joking I'm wearing a black shirt right shorts yeah and jeans so uh do you know what the integral of Ln X is no do you know what the derivative of Ln X is yeah that's one of Rex so here's what we're going to do make it a little bit more interesting too uh I'm going to ask you how much is this from 1 to e now of course the 1 to e part that's really easy we're to take that care of that at the very end okay so when we're going through integration by parts though I really want to figure out what's the integral of Ln X okay well let's start picking uh let's start going through our process is that part of our integration table no it's about to be is it right now uh will a substitution work if we do a substitution of = Ln X the derivative is 1x do you see 1X anywhere up there no substitution work the only thing we have left is integration by parts the only thing we can pick is what okay so U equal lnx now if U equals lnx see if you guys are thinking outside the box here how much is V it's got to have an integral integral DX um if you don't know what integral DX means integral DX means integral of 1 DX so remember how X is 1 X integral DX is really integral 1 DX a lot of people don't write the one but it's there so let's see let's start with a V how much is the integral of DX or 1 DX it's X yeah integral of one is just X you guys okay with that one we know that du equals 1X DX that's actually pretty easy we know what the derivative of Ln X is 1x DX so van if you're okay with that so far let's start putting this thing together by the way you don't start evaluating this right now you wait till the very end to evaluate uh from one to e okay you don't have to change bounds in this because if you think back to integration by parts well what happens is you're using U * V they're already in terms of X you don't have to do a substitution here so don't worry about changeing bounds don't worry about that stuff you just evaluate at the very very end does that make sense to you okay so we know that we can pick you the only thing we have the pick is L and X the rest of it is integral DX that's X so v = x we're going to do U time V minus the integral of V du only du is 1 /x DX now that's kind of interesting you guys okay with what we've done so far u u v got it minus the integral of v no problem so U * V us integral of v and this part is our DU look at what happens in this integral what's going to happen what do I have in there one so I'm going to reverse these because it looks a little funny so I'm going to have X Ln x minus the integral of hello 1 D or just DX again can you do that integral yeah it's actually really easy that's X Ln x minus hello now if I didn't have my one to e plus C if I didn't have my 1 to e put a plus c that's actually the integral of Ln X the integral of Ln X is X Ln x - x or x * L and xus one if you wanted to factor that that is the integral we we actually just did it it's really easy if you do integration by parts kind of cool though right we can invent our own integration tables with some of this stuff like with integral L and X show F should be okay with with that one now if I'm asking you to go from 1 to E I don't have a plus c because now it's a definite integral how you write this you don't continue to write your integral because you actually just did your integral correct this would be silly to write you've done it how you write the evaluation is you either put a bracket like this or the line or even a bracket and we go one to e and then we just plug it in so here we'd have e Ln e minus E minus 1 * Ln 1 - 1 let's see what happens here most of this stuff should be kind of kind of nice uh how much is Ln e this is one so we'd have e * 1 - e minus okay how about how about Len one this is zero 0 - one that's still there you don't just get zeros everywhere when you when you plug in zero or when sorry when you get one zero so this is 1 E * 1 is e minus E okay big old minus ln1 is 0 so 1 * 0 is 0 minus one how much is this whole thing it's one now that's interesting I think that's really interesting you remember what integrals actually mean a reverse derivative it is an anti-derivative well what I mean is a derivative is a rate of change or the slope of a curve at a point do you remember that that's what a derivative is what's an integral area under the curve that's right so a definite integral is the area under a curve between two points the area under the curve lnx between 1 and E if you know what Ln X looks like it looks like this it crosses at the point one here would be the point Point e the area under this curve is exactly one is that not weird so the area under lnx between one and an irrational number e 2.7 blah blah blah blah blah blah blah forever if you find the area under there it is exactly one I think that's just amazing I don't know why but I think that's so cool anyway we can find the the integral of lnx now and we can even evaluate it with different integrals show be okay with with that one interesting stuff today that's interesting it is right I think so now are you ready for the hardest one that we're going to do today this is going to be ridiculous all right we're going to have a lot of work it looks so simple to start with but it's not going to [Applause] be okay okay here we go okay I'm going to add one thing to this problem that's going to make it from easy to hard okay so if I had the interval of secant x if I had the integral of secant x that's actually in your integration table do you understand that so you look there first so you want you wouldn't do anything with this problem except go okay this is uh Ln absolute value of see X Plus tangent X plus I think that's it plus c I want to look that up that's in your table if I did this that's even easier that's tangent you're done if I did this oh man we got a problem cuz that's not in my table I can't do a substitution because if I pick U equals see X the derivative of secant tangent that doesn't appear again so I can't do that so we're going to have to find out some other way to do these sort of problems so can to the fifth or seeking to the third power I'm going to show you some techniques that we're going to get to a little bit later in section 7.2 this kind of like an introduction to some things that we are going to be doing uh I'll give you some better ideas later but right now I kind of want to invent something with you so here's the idea one idea is if you don't know the integral right off the bat and you can't use a substitution integration by parts is kind of defeating you here because there's really nothing to work with uh you get back exactly what you you have here or make it worse it's not a good thing we break it up somehow into a part where at least you know how to take the integral of some of it like that why I'm doing that is well I don't know how to take the integral of secant cubed but I do know how to take the integral of SEC squ does that make sense what you can't do you can't break this up asant time squ time SEC Square just go hey the integral of secant is this time integral of secant square is 10 you can't do that okay uh because that that's like a product that's like the whole idea of uh product means integration by parts so we can't do that so only one product only one product okay well let's start doing this if I do this I'd probably pick uh let's see let's see what you would pick you CU because I don't know how to take the integral of that part I can I can take theal of squ so = Cub X let's do the derivative right now if I do the derivative I'm going to do the derivatives quick right now because I'm expecting that you guys can can do this all the time okay the derivative of secant Cub would be 3^ 2 x * SEC X tangent X do you follow that by the chain rule three comes down becomes a two leave the inside alone derivative inside is see s see X tangent X you guys okay with that one okay if not go back and refresh your memory on how to do integral of secant Cubed on your own V would be the integral of secant 2 x DX this is nice I broke it up into something I can actually take the integral up everybody what's integral of secant squ okay we're starting so our first part here is we know this integral is U time V minus the integral of V du I forgot my DX again V du let's clean this up just a little bit instead of secant squared what am I going to put we have lots of writing going on so I want to make sure you guys are okay on every single step are you okay getting see cubed x * tangent x * V yes no minus integral of V Tan x this is Du it's 3 SEC Cub Tan x and then our DX show hands feel okay with that one okay let's clean it up just a little bit what are we going to do here you know okay three out what else so - 3 integral of tan^ 2 x SEC Cub X DX okay this is fun now well this is fun what do we do here when you have something like a tangent and a secant what you're going to see in the next section that we do is often times we're going to be using identity to change one into the other for instance I don't want tangent X and see X because even if I did integration by parts of that it's going to be really hard to do so let's make it easier or maybe even impossible to do let's make it easier instead of having tan^ 2 x we're going to use an identity for that what you need to know is you need know your identities hav them written down tan^ 2 x is the same thing as 2 X - 1 did you know that this is true so tan^ 2 x is s x - 1 let's use it because now we can change our tan squ into a secant so instead of our Tan x tan^ 2 x we have sec 2 x -1 and then SEC Cub X DX so true that's an identity use it oh wait a second this is kind of neat you're going to see something we just dealt with actually what should I do here can you distri it yeah I'm going to distribute that because right now substitution isn't going to work because if I try this one I don't get exactly this thing back again does that make sense I'd have a secret tangent again that would be a big problem I don't want to do that so let's distribute and this is the same process that I'm going to teach you in the next section you're going to do this a lot so let's distribute this guy well that becomes secant Cub X tan xus 3 integral of tell me what I get from my integral sec to the 5th power of xus Cub X DX okay really do need to show up hands if you are okay with that so far are we all cool what can you do every time you have integral of a subtraction what can you do separate let's separate it now watch what we're going to do make sure that when you separate this this minus three goes to this whole entire integral does that make sense yeah so when we do this this really should have a bracket here what we'll get is SEC Cub X Tan x minus 3 integral secant to the 5th power x hopefully you're with me on this one let me have your eyes on the board here this would separate into two integrals correct it would be minus integral secant Cub this will make it plus three integral SEC Cub X DX [Applause] I want to make sure you're okay with algebra it's just algebra right now but are you okay with it yeah everybody show hands if you are you're okay with now there's something good about what we just did do you see it can you subract say something good about it what do we have good give it a compliment what do we have good about this thing we got the same can you subtract one of the interal from the other this one this is great that's great right now why is that great that's this that's fantastic and we're going to use that in a minute tell me something really bad about this that still has an integral so no matter what we're going to have to deal with this one does that make sense so what I'm going to do this is why this problem is nasty okay right now this would be awesome if there's no integral if this wasn't here you would just add that to both sides you divide by four and You' be done does that make sense this I'm going to give us a little asteris we're going to have to do this one off to the side now integral SEC cubed x DX do you understand that that's really similar to this idea can I strip off a secant uh square if I can do that then I'm going to do the same exact thing I just did so I'm going to do this kind of quickly here but you need to understand it's the exact same idea only in this case I'm not going to have secant Cube I'll just have secant that means we won't have to do this process again we'll get down to here and be able to add our integral so we're going to do this idea twice you're going to need a lot of practice right now so this becomes integral of SEC x * SEC 2 x DX same exact idea strip off something that you know the integral for well then U equal SEC X the derivative is SEC X X tangent X DX V would be the integral of the rest sec^2 X DX and our V is Tan x again you guys okay with that one do you see the same technique at work that we just did strip off the secant squar call that your V integral of your v no problem that's easy uh this one call that your U derivative of U you can all do that that's see X tangent X now if we do our integral that's going to be U * V minus the integral of V du we'll clean it up a little bit so U * V got it minus integral of V hey no problem du okay looks kind of nasty but we can deal with it got that same thing we'll simplify it a little bit tan tan tan squ uh now this looks a whole lot like that one very very similar oh instead of secant to the 3 I have secant to the 1 I'm going to use the same identity again so instead of tan s I'm going to write that as SEC s- 1 you guys still with me yeah are you sure I don't want to blow you out of the water here a lot of algebra a lot of trig here lot of algebra a lot of Tri so secant x Tan x minus the integral of yeah let's call that SEC s x - 1 * see X do the same idea again distribute it [Music] again that would be see Cub xus X DX do the same thing here that we just did here let's split off our integrals again well if we do that then we got SEC x minus sorry notus see X Tan x minus tell me what I'm going to have here what's the next thing see cubed x DX okay tell me what the next sign's going to be is it going to be plus or minus you guys want see why it's going to be plus remember we're separating this this will be integral minus integral but it's in Brackets so this minus would distribute it become plus integral SEC X DX oh goodness almost there let's see we got see X Tan x we got minus integral of nasty thing we can't get rid of now this one we can actually do that look back in your notes if you have to I think I gave it away earlier but uh the integral of secant x do you know what the integral of secant x is X yes you're almost right there's one little part you forgot absolute power so be natural log of the abute power x plus C I'm going to refrain from putting the plus C but yeah you're right I'm going to refrain from the plus C until I'm completely done with my integral I don't want that thing H around because it's really confusing you guys okay with that one yeah you sure have I blown your mind that yet like what the heck this crazy right we're about uh 75% of the way done we're almost done almost here's what we got we did basically a problem within a problem that was just almost as hard same exact idea though break off the secant squar make that your V because you can do the integral of that no problem Tan x You Got U * V minus integral of well V du clean it up tan S no no no C squ minus one distribute split it up again this this stays the same why do I want that to stay the same because it's this it's this right here okay so I gota I gotta gota get rid of this in a second this one I wanted that because I know the integral that's in my integration table now that's why we did that in the last chapter you guys okay with this so far yes no yes yes all right now keep in mind it was this that's equal to this tell me what I'm going to do next notice no integral no integral integral what am I going to do add that so if I add that treat this like an equation add this integral to both sides if we do if if we add that let's see what do I what do you want me to erase it's going to have to be something the left I can't see the right you know what I think I can write it over here too how much is this going to Beal how much that's going to equal is this thing is this still here this is this still here no got rid of it is this still here yeah and we're almost done to stick with it right now what do we know why do we need to divide by two is that two answer what I want I want this without the two so yeah divide by two so we're going to get C Cub X DX = 12 you could do a bracket around whole thing you do one do2 for each of them see X tan X plus 12 Ln absolute value see X Plus Tan x and absolute value crazy with my absolute values I know maybe your brains are hurting a little bit what I want to know is are you okay on just this piece right now show pants if you are okay do you see how it's very similar to the the first example we did today really similar you get down to one part you can't get rid of hey it matches up add it to both sides no problem in this case 1 + 1 gives you two just divide by two this piece is gone that's great that's what we want we have this plus this divide by two you get one half you guys right with that one now here's the awesome part we're good to go on this right this is awesome this piece we're going to be good to go as you pointed out we're going to be adding this to both sides of our equation you got me this piece we now have something for that so what I'm going to do is I'm going to erase this part what we know is this this is back to our asterics so are you guys have any questions on this got erasing as I need space okay so the integral of see to 5th power of X DX is equal to here's what we know we know it's SEC cubed x tan xus 3 * the integral of sec to the 5th again DX plus three times plus three times here's the cool thing here's what we know we wanted plus three times this piece this piece is this whole mess of junk over here you with me so instead of 3 * integral SEC cubed x we're going to have 3 * this whole thing right here so we're going to have 3 * 12 sec X Tang X plus 12 Ln absolute value SEC X Plus tangent X and absolute value and fr talk about probably the longest problem you've ever done huh yeah crazy we're almost done almost we've gotten rid of the integral right we've gotten rid of the integral we're have to probably distribute the three to get three halves instead of 1/2 but that's easy that's not a problem at all what are we going to do next this is the only integral that we don't like it's already matched up with that one just add it to both sides if we do if we add 3 integral see 5th power x DX is an equation just add it over here then I end up getting how much is here 4 over here I've got SEC Cub X that's right this is gone I added it plus I'm going to distribute this 3es x tangent X plus 3 Ln absolute value SEC X Plus tangent X what's the last thing divide everything by four so this gets divided by four this is going to be a 1/4 this will be a [Music] 38 does that make sense if you divide by four so this gets divid by 4id four ID 4 / 4 so we get the integral of see to the 5th power of x equals 14 SEC Cub X tangent X plus 38 anytime you divide a fraction like this just multiply the denominators and you're good plus C got to have a plus c oh my goodness do you get the idea here did I did I just lose you I don't want to lose you a lot it's a lot my goodness this is like a whole p on my piece of paper it's an entire page one entire page you have a lot of things going on here I want to show hands if you could follow it makes sense to you good so so the idea is this start with something that you can actually take an integral hang on start with something you actually take an integral up if you can't find it split it up do the integral of a piece then see what you get if it's trigonometric or something with an exponential or both often times you're going to get back a piece that looks exact what we start with if you don't have any other integrals you're good like we did over here no other integrals no problem just add to both sides if you do you might have to do the whole thing again take care of that integral then you can ultimately add it to both sides divide by your coefficient and you're done okay so the last little bit that we're going to talk about in section 7.1 I'm going to invent for you the reduction formula what this does is when you have like a a sign to some power inside of your integral and we can't take care of it just by the integration table we can actually reduce it to a lower power of sign I'm going to show you how to do that right now so this is called the reduction formula and it starts with this idea suppose you have some integral with sign to some power side of some power greater than or equal to two now naturally you probably wouldn't use this if you had s to the first Power cuz what's the integral of s to the first Power negative coine that's right it's negative coine that' be easy okay so hopefully you understand that this is going to happen for n is greater than or equal to two so when we don't just have sign that would be silly to use this but let's suppose that we do have something some power greater than or equal to two so if you had sin^2 X well probably want to figure out how to how to do that right how to how to find that out and one way that we're going to do these is with a reduction formula uh so basically what we're going to do is do this problem in general and see what it gives us so here's an idea the idea is we want to split this thing up so that we can use integration by parts a substitution is not going to work because we're going to have signs and signs does that make sense to you are you with me is if you okay I'll show you here's one thing we're going to do right now we can't do anything with the problem uh there's no substitution that's going to work because if I substitute for sign I get a cosine does that make sense do you see a cosine up there that substitution won't work so let's break off something now check this check this out if I have S to the N power well let's split off one power of s if I do that then I get S to the nus1 power Time s do the first Power I need you to verify for me that this is equivalent to this you guys with me on that one remember when you multiply common bases you add exponents so nus1 + 1 gives us our n does that make sense here's what I mean about a substitution not working right now if you couldn't visualize this in your head visualize it now if I try to do a substitution or sign what's a derivative of sign it's not sign so this is a problem so what we're going to do now is well let's go through the whole process does this fit our integration table exactly not even close uh will a substitution work we just talked about that no because derivative of this is cosine not sign that doesn't work so we're going to have to use we have to now remember when you're doing integration by parts and some of you haven't had very much practice I know it's a brand new section and you haven't ever done it before when you're doing integration by parts you might have to do it a few times it's not a one and done all the time okay especially if you have something like uh which we saw in the math lab T Cub e to the T you're doing that you're having four integrals there you're going to do it three times integration by parts three times so it's often times you have to do it more than once well here and and the way you pick it you pick it so that one of two things happens one thing has to happen you have to be able to do the integral of V does that make sense you have to be able to integrate that and what you also are looking for is secondary is that the derivative of the U becomes easier doesn't grow it gets smaller power wise okay those are the the two big things you're looking for so here let's look at it now here nothing's going to get better okay nothing's going to get uh easier as far as a derivative goes because s just like cosine or any other trig function it recycles so we're not looking to make the derivative any easier what we'll be looking for is something we can take the integral of can you take the integral of this no no because it still has a power to it can you take the integral of this then U's going to be this thing V is going to be this thing does that make sense yep okay so U equal s to the nus One X and V equals the integral remember how we do integration by parts yeah we cover this thing up V is the entire rest of the thing it includes integral includes whatever else you have it's horrible looking including the DX U some all are getting kind of sloppy on some of your integrals you're not putting the DX you're missing stuff you're not putting the DX over here or the DU make sure you have those little pieces that's kind of important okay so next thing we do why don't you tell me what's the next thing that we do do thetive derivative okay so du equals look at how this derivative is going to work the power is n minus one you with me this involves what it's going to be a chain rule that's a chain rule it's power rule power rule is a chain rule so power rule says watch watch carefully remember we're just proving this so you're not going to have to ever do this proof um I'm going to create a formula for you for you to use which is kind of nice but I want you to follow it at least so the chain rule or power rule says you bring this down you leave the inside alone you subtract one from this and then you multiply by the derivative of the inside which is cine X DX it's just a chain rule it says you bring down the power got it you subtract one from the power got it multiply by derivative the inside we're good to go show fans feel okay with that that derivative awesome now integral of what's the integral of sin how much cos negative cos okay let's see what this does for us so we've just performed the what was that called again the the whole process what is this integration by parts integration by parts okay we're doing integration by parts let's write out what it is we know integration by parts says once you picked your U and you found your V the integral equals u u v minus integral of V du or in our case U time B minus the integral of V du where this whole thing is my du I'm going to clean it up in just a little bit but I want to make sure you guys are okay with this do you see where everything's coming from we've got our U * our V got that minus no problem integral of here's our V and then this whole mess of junk is Du so we got exactly the same thing show hands feel okay with that one D got equals and say what now the the U the U goes here we have that whatever V is whatever you solve for we don't need this we need this the V follows that up so V goes here this is this minus minus integral integral plug this thing in again so cosine X and then du is this whole mess of junk that's it's right let's see where I found it right here does that make sense so look at this again here's V here's du here's V and here's U that's what's going on you find that indefinite integral of sinx we don't have to put um Nega cosine X plus C no the plus C is going to be one constant at the very end of this thing this is just a temporary deal that we're doing okay um in fact some people show this a little bit differently uh some people show it like this they say well where because remember it's it's UV right so they show this as uh DV equals this and then they go oh well let's get rid of the D let's make this V well that's the derivative of V correct how do you want to do a derivative inte they integrate everything we just ignore this inte of DV would be V integral of this is so we kind of we kind of skip that little part just to make it easy it's easier to write it question theine at the end of should be negative no because we're taking a derivative right so the derivative of s is positive cosine the integral of s is negative cosine that's where we got that from but the derivative of s is not negative cosine is posi sign get them straight in your head okay we got to have those right and some of you made that mistake on your last test we got to get these things right you guys all clear with this one I'm going to clean it up just a little bit so uh what we're going to clean up is we're going to do probably pull the negative out front sin to n-1 x cosine X tell me what happens here what happens becomes it does cuz minus and negative that's going to become a plus also one of these things is a a constant what is it cosine X is not a constant that is a constant yeah nus one that's going to be a number right actually comes right from here so we're going to have plus nus1 integral Also let's clean this up a little bit I've got a cosine X I've got a cosine X that becomes let's see what we've done negative comes out that should be easy this becomes a plus no problem this is a constant pull out in front of your integral cosine x cosine X is cosine 2 x and then sin nus 2 power of x n your head if you're okay with that one are you still okay okay it's just a little bit of algebra that we've done now here's the deal uh oh man this right here is a problem because if we do a substitution with either of them it's not going to get rid of the entire thing we don't even know what that power is you with me so what we're going to do is we're going to trick the problem a little bit uh we're going to call this something different we're going to call this using one of our identities remember that identity it's Pythagorean identity for S and cosine so here we go we know that this thing equals sign n -1 of x * cosine X plus nus one that okay so cosine squ no no no no let's not do cosine squar what we're going to do here is we're going to replace that with sign so we have SS and signs and you're going to see Y in just a little bit remember that you've done some of these uh integrals probably on your homework where you have to make it down remember adding the integral to both sides we get the integral back again you're going to see that here in just a minute we're going to get this integral back again remember what happens when we do that when these things recycle like s and cosine does when they recycle go oh man I'm getting the same thing back is that a problem no just add it to both sides and you're good to go you follow so we're going to do that in just a minute so cosine squ no let's change it this is going to be 1 - Sin 2times Sin N - 2^ x DX let me know if I missed anything I'm wrri a lot of stuff hopefully I haven't yall still okay yeah okay tell you what next thing we're going to do next thing we're going to do is we're going to distribute this because I don't like this right now I'm going to distribute this so we're going to have what's that going to become when I distribute this sin 2 x what do you do when you have exponents being multiplied let's just add them how much are you going to get okay and remember this is in here make sure I'm on the my right track here okay you still okay with that so far yeah we are almost to the point where we can start add other side you see we have it right here right but this is wrapped up in this integral so we're going to split up this integral just one big thing that you need to notice this is n minus one time this entire integral does that make sense which means if I split this up it goes to not only first one it also goes to the second one is that clear so when I do that we'll get Okay negative sign N - one x cosine X nothing changes Plus n -1 * integral of sin n - 2x DX don't forget that DX here's what happens so this it's basically just like you dro the parentheses because you're Distributing this to this first integral no problem what's the next thing I'm going to write minus not integral nus one yes in parentheses then integral what's in the integral s of I that's it now this is cool is weird right we're doing this in general uh we didn't start with any number nothing that's this kind of neat so we worked this all the way down we now have this there's no integral there here we got an integral but that's okay we're creating a formula okay this part what is this part it's what we started with yeah it recycles recycles okay so every time you soon this before I seen I think we've seen it like three or four times now in this class because I want you to get used to it this stuff happens especially on your type of homework that you're going to be doing what do we do to get rid of this piece add it to both sides it's an equation this we have proven that it equals this entire mess of garbage so if we just add this nus1 * the integral of s to the n^ X if we add it to both sides let's think about what happens let's do the the right side first on the right hand side this entire thing is gone we have negative s to the nus1 power of x cosine X Plus nus1 integral s of nus 2 power of X DX this is gone you guys right with that one yes no yes no you sure this is all the same right all the same we just added this to both sides therefore it is gonzo simplified now over here this is the interesting one how many integrals are here this just here how many are here so the number up front is one correct one how many are here n- one add them what's 1 + nus one n so then write in Black so we can see difference so that we know n * this integral equals this stuff now every time before when we've had a number out front remember n is just a number it's like two or three or four or five or six or so what do we do with with that let's just if it was three we divide by three if it's n just divide by n so if we divide by n what we end up getting is -1 n sin n -1 x cine X Plus n -1 / n the integral sin n- 2 x DX of course plus C because we're talking about an inte but that will come at the very end let's make sure I did it right do you guys see where the one/ n's coming from dividing by n here we had n minus one well now we're dividing it by n there's only two terms this one and that one this right here this is the reduction formula for sign now if you're thinking that's a lot harder than just doing the problem it's really not I'm going to show you do you want to see an example of how this stuff works I'm going have to race the board though so show up hands and feel okay with the proof wait just I'm just going to erace this side are you guys okay with getting this far didn't make sense on how we got that far you just you just have to use it I just want to make sense uh to you where it came from that it wasn't just magic okay so reduction formula I'm only going to give you one example on how this actually works I think one example will make it very clear on how it works works so here you go is it kind of a cool little proof though it's interesting right it's really nice little proof add both sides of you've been practicing divide you're good to go kind of neat and what this allows you do is this if you got an integral of sin to 4th power of X DX s 4th power of X DX you start thinking you wait a minute how in the world am I going to do that problem I I I don't know I mean does it fit the integration table the way it is right now does it will a substitution work no no remember if I pick sign the derivative cosine it's not up there so that would be a problem integration by parts will it work yes yes it will but we've proven that we can actually do this every single time we have any power greater than one or greater than or equal to two we'll check it out here's how it works uh what's your what's your n so this is sign to the fourth so our n would be four here's how you work it it's really nice what this interval is going to equal let's read it it's going to be negative 1 over what1 over 4 what's the next thing I write sign of where you getting the three from there 4 - x cosine X so let's see n was 4 so 1 over 4 got it sin 2 4 - 1 is 3 x cosine X and we're going to put a plus again yeah n is four so N - 1 that's 3 over 4 what's the next thing we have it's an integral you're still going to have an integral that's why it's called the reduction formula because it's going to reduce the power of the sign by two every time do you see that by two so instead of having s 4th now we're going to have an integral it says of s good yeah n is 4 4 - 2 is 2 and it just made it a little bit better isn't that kind of nice is it easy for you it's just a formula so it's kind of nice that way you don't have to waste a lot of time on integration by parts make sure I got that right questions so then once we get the integral of that we can still keep going by pluging in that's the question does this now fit this model shoot do it again as long as the n's greater than two greater than equal to two if it's one you I you're good to go so if this is a power three you'd be done right now because you'd have the integral of just s to the first right integral of s is just negative cosine hey you're done so we do just do this one more time so we rewrite everything U it's just this little piece remember this is in a bracket some of you are in the in the very bad habit of not writing parentheses parenthetical expressions in mathematics are absolutely crucial uh it allows you to distribute allows you to see what's being multiplied order operations wise what's being added subtracted and not being multiplied okay so they're very important so when we have this thing when we do this this little segment well we can do the same thing just be real careful that you know this positive free force is going to distribute across both of these terms does that make sense that's huge so for us let's do why don't you do it just do this little piece sin^2 X do it just like that okay just write out what that little piece is okay what's our n again people 1 what's n so just plug in the two everywhere you see the N yeah 2 - 1 is one that's cool cosine X I have to race this part now plus plus okay 2 - one that's 1 / two integral of please be careful when you do this uh how much is what's our n what's 2 - 2 what's anything to the zero power don't you be putting a sign there that doesn't make any sense at all if you put sign then this would have had to be a three does that make sense yeah hello yes no yes sign some of you it doesn't make sense like you're telling your eyes 2 - 2 anything that's zero one yes you don't even really need the one there but we can have it so this would become -2 sin x cosine X plus 12 hey what's the integral of one there we go now just keep in mind that this whole thing there's a 34s in front of it and then Plus in front of that and a cosine X and A S 3 power of X and A4 this has to distribute which is not a problem you just can't lose track of it because that would be a problem quick head not if you're okay with that so far do you see how much faster this makes integration by parts if it's just signed of some power that's kind of nice so here we go we've got Final Answer 1 1/4 sin 3 power of x cosine x - 38 hopefully you see where that comes from sin x cosin X plus 3 38 x and lastly what do we always have when we're doing indefinite integrals yay there we go cool kind of cool right work anytime you have just a power of sign to some power greater than equal to two that's the idea show hands feel okay with with that one awesome now we are actually done with Section 7.1 finally oh my gosh thank goodness it's taking us so long it's taking us like a week Michael is there a reduction formula for the other function for cosine yeah I think you can create one for cosign I haven't done it uh I just want to see that this was possible much I bet you guys could work on it see if it is possible 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 7.2:  Techniques For Trigonometric Integrals
well let's start section 7.2 we're going to basically continue where we where we left off right here so it's a really nice segue in the next section you see we just did a trigonometric integral right yeah yeah and we did it with a reduction formula what we're going to tackle now is what if it's not just sine to the fourth power of X what if it's sine of the fourth power x times cosine to the fourth power of X or something weird like that well we're going to talk about at that exact example and I'll I don't know if we're going to get there today but we're going to talk about it eventually probably uh next time probably tomorrow we'll get back at it we're going to see what happens in these cases when we have trigonometric functions being multiplied certain powers inside of our integrals it's going to get kind of fun it's going to get a little weird going to get crazy but we're gonna have a good time with it 7.2 we're going to talk about tree integrals you know the one we're going to start off with first is a very common one we're going to start talking about what happens in your integrals when you have assigned to a certain power and cosine to a certain power being multiplied together so sine and cosine don't necessarily have to have the same power they could but I want you to consider the two cases that that we have okay so here's two cases case number one case number one is the case where we have an odd power on at least one of these functions so either m is odd or n is odd or both are odd do you guys yeah I know it sounds silly but you know what odd means yes odd is like one three five seven nine those those Powers so case number one is where m and or n is odd so they get both be odd what's the only other case they're both either yeah see if one of them is odd naturally the other one's going to be eaten hello if they're both odd none of them are going to be even but if none of them are odd they're both easy so m and and are even of course I'm not going to leave you hanging we're gonna talk about both cases here what I'm going to do for you I'm going to give you the the case by case to tell you exactly what to do first and then we're going to follow those cases with a series of examples does that sound okay with you yeah so let's talk about case one first case number one let's suppose so case number one either m is odd or n is odd so either sine has non power or cosine has an odd power or they both have an odd power if sine has an odd power if power of sine is odd what we're going to do we're going to strip off one of the signs so that what that means is like if it's sine to the third power of X we'd strip off one we'd have sine squared times sine does that make sense we're going to strip off one power so we're going to keep one factor of sine before and then with the other one you see if we have an odd power of sine and we take one sign away we strip off that factor then that odd power now becomes an even power doesn't it if it becomes an even power we can do a couple things with it we can no I'm sorry not a couple things we need one thing with it no we're going to do so keep one factor sign and use the Pythagorean identity to change sine squared x into 1 minus cosine squared x we'll see why this happens why this works I mean just a minute why we're doing it okay so if the power of sine is odd no problem strip off one power one factor sign keep it use pythagorean identities you change your even the rest of the even into this using Pythagorean identity if it's sine to the fourth well hopefully you can do something different with this if not you'd still do it you'd have sine squared squared and you'd still use this then you distribute that would be a very long tedious problem which we're definitely going to get to yay uh if it's the power of cosine that's odd you do the same exact thing only with cosine does that make sense so if power of cosine is odd do this basically this 4 cosine now but they're both odd what would you do if they're both odd I don't know well use the one that benefits you the most for instance pick the smallest power let's pick the one that gives you hopefully a sine squared or cosine squared by itself does that make sense to you so we we use the I'd say the smaller power or use the power that's going to give you something squared okie dokie so if both odd pick the one that will give you a power two if you can thank you if possible okay you guys all okay with case one probably not actually because we haven't even done an example you know what I'm talking about right now except that we're going to be stripping off a sine or a cosine you'll see it in a minute uh let's talk about case two first before we get to an example we definitely want to do at least two of these things before we're done today so case number two case number two that both the powers of sine and cosine are even if both powers are even so cosine squared and sine squared we've got both of them what we're going to do is we're going to use our half angle formulas and you're hopefully going to see why in just a minute you use half angle formulas do you does anybody have to remember the half angle formulas do you remember what they are some that you might I don't know if I don't know they're actually really really really similar for sine we'd have a one-half for cosine we'd have a one-half per sine we've got a one or cosine we've got a one excuse me for sine we have a minus for cosine we have a plus but for either of them we have a cosine 2X now I'm wondering if you see why this helps us chain rule works for derivatives what are we doing so can you do this derivative by itself no but if you change it can you distribute that easily can you do this integral yeah integral here not so much unless you want to do the reduction formula you can do that I suppose integral here piece of cake very easy because that's just a simple little substitution you'd probably do it in your head and then you're done with that okay with that one good would you like to see a couple examples let's bring it on right so so let's consider that let's go through the whole process okay first things first um does that fit in our integration table no well you do a substitution no maybe I don't know yet we don't know what this is designed to do is make your integral possible okay so we're going to manipulate this thing until it's possible so notice we're not doing hardly any calculus at all right now all we're doing is is using some identities breaking this stuff up and then trying hopefully to use the substitution so let's see is it definitely going to be integration by parts all the time no not necessarily so check it uh what do we have here do we have a case one or case two okay one okay we have some odd Powers if you have an odd power you're in case one no matter what okay so case one in this case they're actually both odd so what we're going to do is we're going to look down here and overall I pick one that we're going to power two so what I like to think of it I think the smaller one that's going to be a little easier to deal with because you can substitute out with the other one so okay we got cosine to the third we got sine to the fifth fortunately for us they have the same argument if they did it is he crazy all right so we're gonna leave that the way it is we're gonna look up at our powers what one would be our appropriate I almost said stripper uh our appropriate stripper here the stripper offer which one do we want to strip off the sine of the cosine cosine I'm not going to edit that by the way that's funny so so cosine of the third power no no what I'm going to make this I'm going to make this cosine to the second power of 2x what's the way I do this so hopefully this will make sense to you I'm going to write the sine to the fifth power we're going to leave that there I'm going to put the extra cosine that I stripped off over here don't lose track that this is actually cosine of 2x don't lose the argument okay it is 2x there okay I want to see if you guys understand that this is exactly the same as this these two things are the same show hands you feel okay with that good deal now why did we do it well check it out now that we have a cosine squared in there we change it from an odd to an even cosine squared we have an identity for that so instead of cosine squared we go no no well cosine squared it says for odd Powers try to use the Pythagorean identity okay well that's this or the reverse cosine squared equals 1 minus sine squared so cosine squared 2x no this is 1 minus sine this part is this for Pythagorean identity said so don't forget about the 2x I can't stress enough how important that is uh some of you people who don't do well in the chain rule you need to do well here with substitutions you can keep an eye on it after that we have sine to the fifth power of 2x we've got cosine of 2x DX okay I want to make sure you're still okay with that are you all right with it have we done any calculus yet no it's just true just some trick just identities actually now here's the cool here's the awesome thing as soon as we do this check it out this is why we stripped off one of the cosines and left it over here watch imagine U equaling sine of 2x what's the derivative of sine of 2x derivative 2 cosine 2X because you have a ah Jane rule that's right do you see a cosine 2X over here anywhere awesome that's why we do it so when we get this check this out see how this works you don't have to distribute this right now don't be crazy leave it just like this just like this watch here's one if I pick U equals look don't pit with substitutions with substitution you go through the whole process is in the the integration table heck no can you do a substitution yes don't go to integration by parts don't start doing crazy things if the substitution will work right now pick the substitution substitutions are typically on the inside of something remember we're talking about that instead of something so it's not going to be too many power it's just going to be sine of 2x if the derivative is there your substitutions can work so pick U equals sine 2X d u we all should be pros at this right now a derivative of sine of 2x is 2 cosine two x where's the two coming from DX I know many of you have done substitutions two different ways since I've been teaching in two different ways as well I'm going to stick with that there's two ways to do this you can solve for DX completely and get d u over 2 cosine 2X or you can just divide by two and get d u e over 2 equals cosine 2X DX hey do you see this anywhere in our integration that's why we put it last put Alaska that sticks out that sore thumb this thing is right here what that means for us is our interval is going to get really really pretty right now let's see what we've done do we still have an integral yeah yeah do we see level one hello are you with me yeah okay we still have a minus instead of sine of 2x squared what's this whole thing going to mean already it looks nicer doesn't it what else do I need up here bracket or parentheses I don't care which but you have to have them now check this one out I get sine to the fifth power of 2x sometimes it like in in your past substitutions you don't substitute everywhere you see the same thing because you're going to simplify it out sometimes you do here we're going to they're going to say hey if sine 2x is U that's also U this is U to the okay one more instead of cosine 2X DX we're going to have equal to I need to show off hands if that makes sense to you now that's beautiful here's why it's so nice what do you do with the two does it become a two or a one careful on that so one half integral what are you going to do here this is why we wait to distribute here we don't do it here this is crazy okay if you had to distribute here look at this if you distribute it here you have this whole thing and then you have this thing again right that's silly you do two substitutions and it would work but it's going to make it way harder all right we just wait till here so it's so much nicer now we can do our substitute or so no sorry our distribution and get U to the fifth minus U to the seventh du man that's like the first type of integral you saw in calculus one like that that thing is easy we get a one-half put your bracket there don't let yourself make a mistake of not Distributing this later we got what is this anyway uh you did the six over six perfect find the few to the eight over eight foreign here's our U so we're going to have here all the way down here we write it a couple different ways if you want to here's one way you can do sine of 2x to the sixth power over 12. minus sine of 2x to the eighth power over 16 and plus two of course you could do if you don't like it over 12 you could do 112 you could do minus 1 16 of 2x plus C you could Factor if you really wanted to but this is what I'm looking for from you show pants if that actually made sense is it that hard no but here's the thing uh the the math here it I promise you it's not hard it's just you got to follow the steps like precisely and you got to be able to identify what case you're working with the first step here is the hardest not the hardest it's the most important so the first step in doing this correctly is really really key for you to get to the correct answer here if you strip off the wrong thing it's going to take you either 10 times longer or it's not going to work out for you all right so let's get started so what we're working on we're going to continue working on some of these trigonometric integrals and yeah they get pretty hairy but we have some cases some some ways to deal with these things that make them a little at least a little bit nicer we have a technique a method to go through this so let's consider some of these we'll gradually make them a little bit more difficult so you can see some different ideas that we have to work with let's look at the integral of sine cubed x cosine squared x DX now I gave you some cases what I said was there's really two of them either you have at least one odd power or you don't if K if you have case one if you have at least one odd power the goal is going to be split off either a sine or a cosine of that odd power and then use a Pythagorean identity if you can use a Pythagorean identity you change it from Sines and cosines to either all signs or all cosines does that make sense that's the idea here so I want you to get familiar with what you're doing don't just follow this like a pattern really understand what we're trying to do we're stripping off one of these things firstly so that we can make a Pythagorean identity substitution oh well substitution and then we'll have all of one type of function either sides or cosines with the exception of that one thing we stripped off the reason why we need that one thing we stripped off is because then a regular U substitution will work really really nice so let's look at our problem do we have an odd power are they both odd no okay so if one's odd that kind of makes our choice easy as to what we're going to do if there's one odd we're going to strip off one of those factors and use the Pythagorean identity if they were both odd we typically pick the smaller power because that will usually give us a Pythagorean identity easier does that make sense to you so for us what are we going to pick for for the thing that we're stripping off here sign or cosine and why are we picking that it's odd and if I strip off the sign I'm going to get sine squared that's the Pythagorean identity I'm looking for so here we're going to write this and I typically write it this way I'll write my sine squared x first and then my cosine squared x and then I'll put my sine X the very back whatever you strip off right there you put in the back and the reason is is because what's going to happen again the idea here use this use this to get a Pythagorean identity that way signs become cosines these will all be cosines and then I can make a substitution hey what's the derivative of cosine sine yeah so that's the idea is we're trying to get to that we're trying to get back to this going away so uh by the way some people ask at this point well wait a minute why don't I use the Pythagorean identity on this one right here well if I do then I'm going to get sine to like the fifth power somewhere and that's that's not a good thing either we want to be able to make that substitution and get rid of this so as soon as we get our odd power we strip off one of the factors then we go ahead and say well the method I gave you said change one of those things by the Pythagorean identity whatever you stripped off that's what you're you're left with so this thing is going to be what is it one but yeah the rest of this stuff is still here the rest of that is right there quick head now if you're okay with it so far yeah if you're going another one now why does that help us well why it helps us is because right now I don't want you to distribute that be silly okay because this whole thing would have to go here and here you'd have two integrals instead of our one we want to make this easy right here if I do a substitution on cosine I make this U and make this U what's the uh what's the derivative of cosine again sorry close what is it that's going to go away yeah my integral is going to change to a negative but that thing's going to go away does that make sense this is the idea if you have an odd power break off one factor use an identity make a substitution that's how it works often with this stuff so here we go well this is really nice as soon as you see this don't worry about Distributing or anything because if we do a basic substitution for cosine do I want cosine squared or just cosine what do you think cosine yeah just cosine if I have cosine squared I got to do the chain Rule and that's really annoying because I'll have cosines and Sines coming up at us and we don't want that so d u equals negative sine X DX when I'm doing my uh my substitutions on a lot of these trig integrals I won't solve it for DX I know I showed you that sometimes sometimes I don't what I typically do is just move this sine or any constants over so negative d u would equal sine X DX because and this is why we put this at the back end do you see how this piece matches up perfectly with that piece you see what I'm talking about that's what we want so I move this at the back end because this is now really nice easy substitution right there okay so why don't you tell me what's going to be on the inside of our integral now squared okay good we got the one minus what number cool cosine is U so cosine squared is U squared excellent what else times zeros times sine X times U times U squared okay so we got one I get minus I Got U squared I get another U squared du there's something a lot of you love missing what are you what are you missing right now oh besides that parentheses missing parentheses that's important why is that important for some reason some of you guys have the tendency to miss parentheses and still distribute because in your head you like know they're there or something it's really important for you to put those you need them to say this is what I'm doing otherwise this math kind of falls apart you need to show that so these parentheses are not trivial and then now sine X DX is the same thing as what okay we don't want to forget the negative d u so times negative du what are we going to do with this thing right now what do you think hold the negative value okay so negative integral what else are we going to do that will be U squared minus U to the fourth don't forget the DU don't get sloppy with this integration you got to show all this stuff none of it is trivial you guys okay with this so far yeah the integral I go bam how am I going to do that something really really easy this is brilliant this is nice so we'll have negative what's the integral of U squared is well you tell me what am I what am I having wrong here okay so if I don't have my brackets then this is wrong if I do have my brackets then we have negative U cubed over three plus u to the fifth over five naturally you could write this in the reverse order might be a little bit nicer to do U to the fifth over five minus U cubed over three now we don't want to stop there what's the next thing we got to do your u back in there that's very good so whatever our U is we'll have and I'm going to reverse this right now so I'll have cosine to the fifth power of X over five minus cosine to the third power of X over three and that's the idea I wonder if that makes sense to you by showing hands can you show me if that does easy medium hard what do you think kind of medium right this part as soon as you see this this is easy this part is the part that people struggle with how do I do it you got to get used to seeing these things following the pattern you know what I mean that way you go okay hey look at this odd power that's an even power I'm gonna strip off one of those things that's the idea here shall we do another one yeah so so far I think I've given you two odds and I've given you one odd let's see how it works with this example you know what I'm gonna need some more room do you have any questions on this because I'm gonna erase it some of these things take a take a while so okay so now we're going to do sine to the fourth cosine to the fourth so as soon as you see this problem on a test yes you're going to have something like this on a test as soon as you see this on a test you all right cool uh how in the world are we going to do that well go through the pattern do we have at least one odd hour okay so they're both even if they're both even the idea of Pythagorean identity goes out of your head because if I do this if I strip off either a sine or a cosine I'm left with an odd power does that make sense yeah the Pythagorean identity is not going to work with the odd power your substitution won't work because you'll have an extra sign or an extra cosine somewhere that's not a good idea so if you have both evens the idea is you're going to manipulate this thing a lot it's going to be a lot of work but what we're going to be using here is the half angle formulas where we have sine squared equals one half one one minus cosine two x and cosine squared equals one half one plus I do very good so we're going to be getting down to those things here in just a minute so let's work on how we might go about doing this and there's a few ways to do it okay so here's what I do if I'm working on this problem the first thing I'm doing is I'm going to try to make this either all sine or all cosine if I have the same power like 4 4 we can typically do this check this out well I could make sine x cosine X all to the fourth is that true yeah sure I could do that my idea right now is to combine my Sines and cosines with some sort of an identity right now if you don't know it I can actually do that so if I'm looking at a sine x cosine X I'm going to use this identity over here do you know this one that's the right one do you guys know that one double angle okay we'll check it out we can manipulate identities all the time if we know they're true we can manipulate them so if I take this this thing looks a whole lot like this Peach donut yeah well I'm gonna make this be exactly like this I'm basically just going to divide by two then sine x cosine x equals one half sine 2x oh look at that we okay with that yeah children's feel okay with that one well what that means is hey look at that I can make it sine x cosine X to the fourth of course this is a special case Okay where they're both exactly the same power if they're not exactly the same power then naturally this won't work but I want you to see this at least once where they're both the same power you got me yeah so we can do this okay then this piece is one half sine two x so our integral is integral of one half sine two x all to the fourth power the X y'all still okay yeah you sure let's keep on moving what's the next thing that I need to take care of um I don't care really about this use substitution I really don't because right we it'd be very trivial U equals 2x you'd have a one-half sure don't worry about that we can do that basically in our head what I'm worried about and we're going to be changing things so if you do this if you do a u substitution on this now you're gonna have to do it later again too so don't worry about it until the very very end when you're actually evaluating the integrals does that make sense don't worry about right now what I do want to get rid of is this looks kind of nasty to me can I take this to the fourth power and this to the fourth power yeah you can okay let's do that so I'm going to have the integral of what is one half to the fourth power you know what people do when they're just learning this or when they're going too fast on a test or their homework is they'll forget about this guy and they'll give me one half again do you see how common that might be when I'm grading papers I see that a lot where are they getting 1 16 from I'm getting one half all the time my goodness well you might not be taking that to the correct power so be careful with this stuff this whole thing is being raised to the fourth imagine if you understand that concept okay okay then I've got sine to the fourth power of two x DX looks a little bit nicer what's the next thing I'm going to do 1 16. integral sine to the fourth two x DX now stop for a second if you were so inclined thinking about what I taught you back in the last section what could you use here you could use the reduction formula it would absolutely work right now do you guys see why oh yeah it's well there's no why I know but there's a sign look at the sign it's through the fourth power that power is greater than two greater than equal to two you could use reduction formula right now in fact we did sine to the fourth in class just like two days ago remember well the two days ago you took a test but three days ago you remember doing that yes last thing we did you could do it right now you can just make a substitution this is where you do it U equals 2x D over two this would be 1 over 32. you got me then you get sine to the fourth of Udu and you do production formula like I think it's two times if you do reduction formula twice and you'd be done with this thing did you guys get what I'm talking about look back in your notes or watch the video from the last section if you don't remember how to do reduction formula now what if you don't see reduction formula is there another way to do it the answer is yeah which is really interesting because what's going to happen here is we're going to get our integral evaluated and it's going to look different than if we had done this with reduction formula reduction formula will work it will be equivalent but it's going to look different does that make sense now I don't care how you do it if you see this I've already taught you reduction formula right you can do it that's fine anytime if it's signed you some power go for it some of us have a few of you have proved the reduction form for cosine go ahead and use it your answers are going to look a little bit different than if you do this next technique so Technique One you work it all down you go hey I see reduction formula I can do that it's assigned to a power greater than or equal to two no big deal remember that one it's the one over NS and you know Sines and cosines and a minus and one n Over N minus n minus 1 over n integral and it reduces it for you well let's say you don't see it is there a different way and the answer is yeah if there's not a reduction form impossible or you don't see it we can still do this with those half angle formulas and here's how you'd work it instead of thinking of this as sine to the fourth power what we need to do is we need to find something that will allow us to make this substitution we need this basically so when we get down here we go man how do I do it reduction formula if you don't see reduction formula you're going to have to rewrite this again so how we're going to rewrite it is 1 16 integral let me rewrite sine to the fourth power how am I going to write it as something like sine squared what do I do sine squared 2X I'm going to change what you said just a little bit I want sine squared 2x to sum power what is it squared squared you all right on that one yeah now as soon as you do that as soon as you go well wait a minute uh there's some even powers I'm gonna I know I'm gonna be using half angle somewhere unless I do reduction form that works out that nicely we can do that but if we can't then we're going to have some sort of a half angle formula coming up somewhere and here's where we go go with it so from here we still get a 1 16. sine squared let's do sine squared 2x let's make it into the cosine here's why we do it if we take sine squared and we change into one half one minus cosine maybe you're not maybe you don't know why we're going to do this what's the power here two what's the power here it basically reduces the power for you does that make sense you do you can do the integral of cosine to the first Power you can't do the integral of sine the second power of the wave is you need reduction formula or you need to make the substitution so we're going to do that use the identity now let's be real careful with this don't lose your stuff what's the power going to be up here okay and then inside let's do that what's going to be one parentheses one minus one minus okay I like that one half one minus and then cosine for sure now be very careful don't lose pieces of this thing it's not 2x explain why is it to it why is it not 2x okay because it starts from what's the argument about sine function here and this says whatever your X is also support it whatever your X is you're going to multiply it by two so if we have X yes 2x if we have 2X it's going to be do you see how common of mistake that's going to be for some people in here yeah okay don't make that mistake because then when you do your substitution you'll have a one-half when you should be having a one-fourth does that make sense or 1 8 or something so this is going to be 4X be careful be careful with your math okay with that so far good deal okay now what goodness gracious well if we're doing it this way we can't do a substitution because if we substitute for cosine is there a sign anywhere to be had we can't do it the only thing we can do here distribute all this junk so what I'm going to do same thing I did here I took one half to the fourth we're going to take one half to the second how much is that going to be so I've got a 1 16 out front already this is going to give me a one-fourth don't forget about that guy you need that so 1 4 you know what I need the bracket hope you follow the notation here all we did was we took one half squared it's one-fourth we took this thing now this thing now it's this thing squared 1 minus cosine 4X to the second power quick hit not be okay with that one can you guys distribute this are you just going to square this and square this at least we're having six don't do that remember that what this means is 1 minus cosine 4X times 1 minus cosine 4X would you please spend some time to distribute that for me what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull the 1 4 out front we have a 116. we now have another 1 4 what's 1 16 and 1 4 how much are we going to get there 164. then what so this now combines from 164. you guys are Distributing this right now for me so hopefully you get this it's not usually not very hard you guys know how to foil this is one minus 2 cosine 4X plus cosine squared 4X how many people got that perfect that's what goes here let's take a real close look at our integral and see what we got going on um if I asked you to could you do the integral of one yeah no substitution that's piece of cake could you do the integral of cosine 4X yeah yeah what's the integral of cosine now you'd have a 4X that would be over four you'd need a little substitution I typically do those in my head U sub on that would be over four does that make sense to you now can you do this one okay let's try this again integral of this could you do it yeah easy integral this could you do it without a substitution a little substitution but that's easy can you do the integral of cosine squared is that anywhere in your integration table no no we got to go over again so we start from the very beginning with our trig stuff what power do we have odd or even power with even Powers we use what Pythagorean identity or half angle which one do we know a half angle for cosine squared yeah that lets you break that down again there's lots of steps here lots to this be very careful write these all out I know some of you don't like to write steps and I'm going to say two stinking bad do it anyway you got to write this you got to be able to do this and make no mistakes on it so we have one we got minus cosine 4X we've got a plus let's look inside here remember that cosine squared x equals one half one minus cosine oh sorry plus cosine 2X hopefully we're familiar with that one let's let's apply it here I've got the one I've got the minus cosine 4X I've got the plus what am I going to write next one half got it keep on going come on tell me one plus cosine 2X without 8. okay now you all need to be careful on what the argument of that thing is going to become listen we're starting with cosine squared of 4 x if cosine squared x gives me cosine 2X cosine squared 4X gives me cosine remember are you taking an argument you multiply by two what is it perfect okay I'll tell you what we're almost done I want to do about a 10 second recap to make sure you guys are good with this stuff uh you okay with the Megan I'll do the fourth power yeah it's a special case and I get that you're not always going to have the same power there but when you do man try something like this it's kind of nice use identity are you gonna have to know your trig identities yeah otherwise this stuff doesn't make sense you gotta have that down people take calculus two to finally fail trigonometry people take calculus one to finally fail algebra all right but this is this is trig I mean my goodness we need to love tree then we go okay well that's cool you know what we can uh just take it all to the fourth power we recognize this one as either a reduction formula we could do which probably would be a little bit quicker than this to be honest with you sometimes you won't be able to do reduction form this eventually will or we go well I didn't remember that so let's practice doing the uh the whole even power thing the even power thing is make it a sine squared or make it a cosine squared somehow then use a half angle cool then distribute it look for any more squares you're basically reducing this with a half angle form it's like an inherent reduction formula the half angle formula always reduces your power you get what I'm saying so we look again okay well we got to do it one more time half angle again reduces the power one more time now we have everything to the first Power we get one no big deal cosine of the first we're going to distribute this in just a bit cosine of the first let's pretty this thing up a little bit what are you going to do here let's do it I think rule as nice as possible before we actually integrate so we got 164 we're going to have 1 minus 2 cosine 4X don't lose track of that 4X plus one half plus one half cosine eight X DX okay I'll tell you what whenever you distribute an algebra the one thing that you should probably do after you distribute is check for what that's right like terms do we have any like terms here yeah yeah I just combine those numbers this is one and one half that's three halves that'll make it integrate one less term here which is kind of nice combine your terms if you have any can I combine cosine of 4X and cosine of 8X no that's a No-No so 164th we've got three halves minus two cosine 4X plus one half cosine eight X DX my goodness that's a lot of junk I want to make sure that we're all all good to go do you guys feel okay on what we've done so far yes no okay can we integrate that little piece this one this one it's the same thing it's integrated when you do it just be real careful with your constants that's typical I mean almost nobody almost nobody gets the integral of cosine wrong y'all know it's sign it's the constants that are going to get you here so don't lose track of stuff we're going to have 164. we're gonna have a big old bracket here let's integrate piece by piece integral of three halves three times there three half sex very good minus here's how integrals work if you want to do these in your head this is the way I do it I do little substitutions in my head because I don't want to waste my time so watch watch here's what you do um the two's a constant correct yeah integral of cosine it's sine 4X what's the derivative of 4 x 4 over 4. that's how you do it so derivative of this thing that's a basic substitution when you just have constants it'll typically work with those arguments you should put it over whatever the derivative is if you notice this is coming from the d u over 4 that you would get does that make sense so that's where that's coming from let's try the next one uh what's the next thing I write one now we're able to do those without actually having to write a special substitution on that because that takes a little while right if you have a substitution here you have another substitution here that takes some time and that two and four cancel out well we're going to talk about that right now I want to make sure you guys are good on this so far short hands if you want okay so yeah a few things are going to happen of course we're always going to look at simplifying two with four done this becomes what 16. okay and then maybe we'll distribute maybe you won't it kind of depends I'm going to distribute because I want to so we'll have 3 over 128x oh goodness we'll have minus when we distribute notice this is a one-half yeah 1 over 128 sine of 4X plus wow what's this going to be so basically you have 64 times 2 times 8 or 64 times 16 I don't even know you tell me sounds good I'll take your word for it sine 8X and finally plus 3 plus c yeah wow wow that was a lot of work could you have left the 64. absolutely no problem you could just let the fact that you could factor out uh something else Steve question totally should have just factored out in one half yeah you could you could have factor to one half and made it 128 and then 3x should just send reduction formula that's right but you know what there's times when you can't right so I want to get you really practicing this uh the next one you see that we're going to be able to do that as well but I want you I want to see you practicing this this method does that make sense to you yeah so I get it the Russian formula works that's what I would do notice that this is gonna be a little more concise than the reduction formula production has Sines and cosines in it so this would be a little bit nicer in my opinion but you could do it with reduction form are you guys ready for the next one yeah okay the next one's gonna be some more question if we were to use the reduction formula is it possible that we could get something that looked different but was it equivalent to that that's actually just what I was saying is that when you do reduction formula it's going to have Sines and cosines the integral will be equivalent and you can get the same thing with identities but it's going to look different okay what happened you know it's the same thing you do the identities to prove it like all those times Intrigue where it said prove this identity that's how you do it that's why they had you do those so anyway uh let's continue let's do this one hey there's no DX there so I drew this one wrong you just say you can't do it oh yeah did you have any questions on that we're good yeah okay please watch the video that's right watch the video again okay there you go questions too bad just joking let's make this sign to the sixth DX now what would you use here I would use reaction formula what if you didn't know the reduction formula forgot it I just missed it or just want to practice like I do I'm doing it differently can we do it yeah of course we can because he can take a lot of work yeah yes it is so how would you do it if you didn't have the reduction formula yeah sine of x to the side you're close but no you see if I want if I have even let's look at the powers look at him do I have odd Powers no I actually have two even Powers if you don't think there's two of them I know cosine is zero so it doesn't really count but I have sine to the sixth power that's my only Power it happens to be even so what are you going to use ladies and gentlemen when you have all even powers where you use a Pythagorean theorem or half angle have angles so we need to make this a half angle half angle only works if you have sine squared or cosine squared so somehow I want you to rewrite that with a sine squared go for it and don't write out sine squared times sine squared times sine squared okay you could I guess but it's going to be the same but it just looks sloppy how am I going to write out the sine of the sixth Tower as sine squared to something did you all do that one yeah okay I wanna I want you to I want to see if you understand the reason why we just did that what are we trying to use when we have even powers even powers only work when you have signed to the third second or cosine of the second we're going to have any cosines so that's the only thing that's going to work for us is to do sine to the second and then do the third power are you guys with me yeah do the next step can you use the half angle formula here yeah really okay to it let's see if the old guy did you get one half times one minus cosine two x and then all of that raised to the third power with the brackets yeah cool next thing you're going to do let's do it what are you going to do yeah you are this is going to become how much 1 8 is going to be pulled in front of my integral you follow yeah now what do you have to do with this thing uh just keep it that way foil it I know what I forgot something sorry you're going to have to distribute that so if that was to the my gosh if that was to a higher power you'd have to distribute even more so yeah you have to if you're going to do this method without reduction formula you actually have to distribute that so on your own right now off to the side do one minus cosine 2X times 1 minus cosine two x times one minus cosine two you're gonna have to distribute that I'll let you do that for about 10 minutes I'm right on the board here you're welcome I think that's right you want to check there are easier ways to do binomial expansion that's one of them if you know the pipe the Pascal's triangle one three three one and you know alternating signs with a minus minus plus minus and you know Powers will use zero sorry Powers getting zero one two three you can distribute things like that very quickly very quickly so if I did like to the fourth power basically be the same it'd be one four two one four six four one and then you can if you know the the binomial expansion you do that so anyway this is what you should have if you distribute it and combine like terms did you all get that uh yeah are you just gonna trust me that that's right yeah probably okay that's right let's continue uh now now look after you distribute after you do that you really do got to look at your problem see what's going on here folks check this out can you do the integral of this yeah and you're going to leave that don't bother changing that that's a good thing remember that you could separate this into one two three four more integrals we're not going to we're doing our head but you could so leave this alone leave this alone can you take the integral of cosine yeah leave that alone can you take the integral of cosine squared no so this is something we got to work on okay let's see if you're paying attention with cosine squared would I use Pythagorean identity or half angles bam that's exactly right so this is going to be a half angle right here now stop we're gonna do one more thing cosine to the third can you do the integral of this right now no no change that one too so there's another one ugly little star isn't it another little star if you get cosine to the third okay let's think about are you going to do half angle are you going to do Pythagorean identity oh it's exactly right so let's go slow I want you to just do the half angle right now on this guy just do that let's see three but I know this thing is one half one minus sorry one plus cos oh let's see if you got it this is this part right here is one half 1 plus cosine 4X did you all get the 4X good minus let's talk about this one now if I've got a cosine cubed of 2x you're right that stands for that's an odd power so what do we do with odd powers pull one off very good we strip off a we get the stripper we get the uh that's right so we strip one off here cosine 2X DX oh look at that we're gonna do a couple things at once okay so don't get lost on me here I'm going to leave all this stuff the same I'm going to distribute this because that's nice we'll distribute that I'm also going to start changing this guy show pants feel okay with this so far all right so we've got a 180. we've got an integral we got a one we've got a minus three cosine two x we've got to check this out this is three halves times one is three halves three halves times cosine four x is three halves cosine 4X so this is exactly the same all I'm doing is Distributing three halves so we got those two pieces quick head knocker out with that one now when you're working with this stuff inside of an integral you can do two things you can do this if you want to you can go wait a minute this is too confusing for me right now I don't want to deal with this here you can write a DX and split off another integral does that make sense yeah do it off the side just don't forget some minus you're gonna have to have a bracket around all the junk that you do right now does that make sense to you yeah you can do it in here too and do the substitutions and or distribute and make things a little bit nice for you that's what I'm going to do so either you're doing this off to the side no problem or you're doing it the way I'm going to show you you guys okay with this so far okay so this is like its own little problem right here so I would choose to do I say okay well you know what uh this right here this is the same what are we doing here we're doing half angle or Pythagorean because connected with this you do half angles so again if you would have this integral so Pythagorean off to the side if you chose to do it this would become 1 minus sine squared you want Pythagorean not half angle that is cosine 2X that's supposed to be a little two there and then you do a simple substitution and you're practically done with that you guys okay with that one okay maybe I'll do both just so you see that it works out the same over here what would your you become sun it's usually inside of something sine of what do you those people who hate to do the chain rule don't mess this up uh what's this going to become or d u over two equals cosine two x DX exactly what we have here therefore we get I know I'm working quickly but we've already done something very similar to this this is one minus U squared this guy is d u over two or in other words this is one half integral of 1 minus U squared d u one half U minus U cubed over three one half U minus 1 6 U cubed and lastly we do our association back in we'd add one half what is it what was our substitution anyway minus 1 6 sine cubed 2X okay I know I did it fast but I want to know how many people could do this on their own at this point it should be pretty much all of you because we all know how to do a substitution this was the only big thing is seeing just really have you noticed how the the hard part about this is seeing what to do it's not actually doing it it's going oh wait I got a cosine cubed is that half angle or is that Pythagorean it's odd so it's Pythagorean this was even therefore it's half angle so well separate it so that you can do Pythagorean so Cube no no no strip it off we've got Pythagorean we've got that Pythagorean identity do a little substitution it works out pretty nicely show offense if you have the same thing on your own you're okay with that one cool now notice something this integral is done so this is what you plug back in right here when you're done with the integral does that make sense it'd be minus this whole mess of crap now if you do it the other way I don't even know if I want to show you the other way now that we've already done it stick take some time uh if you do it the other way basically just put a bracket here you do the same thing sine squared 2X cosine 2X DX you would distribute it so you would have a cosine 2X here I would probably combine that cosine 2X somewhere over here and then you'd have the same substitution that you just did does that make sense to you so you can do one another way I'm going to leave that so I like that way I like doing off to the side so this is going to be minus this stuff one half the sine 2X minus 1 6 sine cubed 2x I'll put the plus C on the very end of my problem I don't need to deal with it right now okay so I don't want to lose you I don't lose anybody so let's check it out you guys are okay down to here correct this one we said no no let's separate this let's call this one big big fat integral that's why we get the DX right here where there wasn't one before then we're subtracting the integral of this guy so we said now let's make this a DX and we'll have the integral of this so we move that over here we do it off the side it's a problem within a problem so 1 minus sine squared 2x times cosine 2X do the integral then put it right back we get the same thing so are we going to integrate this right now heck no are we going to integrate this stuff right now yes of course we are what might you want to do before you start integrating that final returns yeah that's right and in fact if you would have done this the other way that I was about to show you you would have some more like terms to combine so you have less terms it's whether you want to combine them now or combine them later we're going to do it at some point what like terms do we have how much is it so this is this is gonna be five knots okay so 1 8 integral five halves minus three cosine two x this is gone plus three halves cosine of 4X notice DX calculus ends here this we've already done distribute yeah you can do that you can distribute that right now if you wanted to you want to do that yeah so minus one half sine 2X good plus 1 6. sine to the third power 2x now let's work on the integral of this thing almost done you're forgetting the DX on both of those what DX the whole integral oh you split it that looks kind of the whole idea was right here we split this and we did this integral separately that way we use substitution and go yeah yeah you'll want this to do this separate we have it back in terms of X now we can put it back so this was all one integral this one I said no this is too hard for me to do right here or you can you actually could not a big deal or you could do it separately I just want to give you that option so either way and I don't care how pull that off make sure you get all the way done then you plug it back here but notice we've already done the integral there is no more integration to do here I really do need you to understand that show fans if you do you feel okay with with that question someone looked like they had one question you sure okay almost done so 1 8 times some nasty stuff let's do this integral can you do the integral of five halves yeah minus be very careful with these guys this would be minus three integral of cosine two x please sorry six times two no it's not times two divide by two when you do integrals you're dividing by this derivative because you're setting this equal to U derivative of this equals d u so DX would equal d u over the two plus three halves let's try this again okay derivative this one perfect again you're kind of doing those substitutions in your head minus all this stuff oh dear this is fun right foreign so working from the very bottom 5 16 x oh goodness minus 3 16. sine 2X I know right sine 4X minus one half sine 2X plus 1 6 sine Q 2x oh goodness all right well almost done what's in the last thing that we're going to do distribute the 1 8 on both sides we did we're going to be eight times it also goes here yeah you're right this is a big bracket yeah you're right yeah absolutely right so if I distribute that uh what What's this change too and 42. how much 40. it's only one more thing we got to do we're looking for any like terms so like terms do you see any uh the sign I don't know sine 2x yeah this one no this one yes these two are like terms and thankfully because Patrick got this redistributed that they have a common denominator right now which is really nice so we're going to have I was just testing you Patrick you passed 5 16. how much is that going to be 4 16. and lastly let's see okay I want to show you one more thing with this if you didn't if you didn't do the integral so I do want to prove to you that it does come out the same so imagine you didn't do this right here what you'd have is 1 minus sine squared 2x times cosine 2X all DX you'd have a minus cosine 2X Plus sine squared 2X cosine 2X DX we distribute this thing this is what you would combine with this thing it would be minus four so when you look at that minus this become minus 4 cosine 2X if you do the integral of the minus 4 cosine 2X you get minus 4 sine 2x over 2. correct that would be the two you get 2 sine 2x when you multiply by 1 8 you get the one-fourth right there does that make sense to you because it matches the coefficients are going to match this so this one would get combined with this one right now this one is what you do over here you do the um the use of on sign if you get du equals 2 cosine 2X DX you get a d u over two equals cosine 2X DX this is what would match right here give you a little substitution kind of off to the side and what you're now getting is you get U squared over two does that make sense you squared over two so when you do U squared over 2 check that out U squared over 2 would give you U to the third over three times two that's six six times the one the one-sixth 1 6 times 8 gives you the 148 here's the U to the third power of the sine 2x oh my gosh that's a lot of work either way it works I just want to prove to you that it actually does so it means if that one made sense okay that's hard right what would be way easier formula would be easier but if you don't have it or you can't use it then this is what you have to do so what you should know at this point odd Powers odd Powers you use which identity please everybody odd Powers Pythagorean even Powers very good all right let's do our last example about integrals that involve sine and cosine after this we'll talk about some other types of trigonometric functions like tangent and secant cotangent cosecant that stuff I'll give you the rules on that after this example but I want to go through one more maybe when you don't have some whole number exponents so you get a feel about what's going on now when we talked about our rules on integrating sine and cosine there's two cases there was the case where both powers are odd where both powers are even or where they have one even and one odd when you have a fraction like this look for the other one this would be pretty hard to deal with so we're going to look at sine to the third power what case does this fall under this fall under both even both odd or one of them being odd that falls under one being odd now when we have that one being odd do you remember what we do with that break one off that's right we strip one off remember we strip it off because what we're going to do is oh I hope you know we're either going to do half angle or we're going to do Pythagorean what's the case here it's gonna be Pythagorean because we're going to strip one off and change the sine squared as soon as you change the sine squared to a cosine the reason why we strip off that side is because now a substitution will actually work the derivative cosine is basically sine with a negative the derivative cosine gives you the sine it's gone it's out of there and we're able to integrate the rest of the simple substitution you ready so let's try it so the first thing to look at here we have odds or evens that counts as an odd so whenever you get an odd power of sine or an odd power of cosine strip off the one that gives you a square power so I don't want sine to the third I'm going to write this as sine squared x I like it and cosine one half I like to write that one first because I like to strip off this sign and put it here because it makes our substitution look a little bit better okay so again here's the idea we got an odd power strip one off and then what are we going to do with the sine squared what identity is that is that the half angle of the Pythagorean use that one so here we go okay cool I like this we're going to do 0 to pi over two we're not going to touch this till the very end the idea again behind doing this is manipulate your integral so that you can use a substitution the way that we do that is we try to make these be the same trigonometric function you have to make it the same and you have to make it the same so that when you take a derivative it's this guy over here so use Pythagorean to change sine into a cosine then we'll have all this all the same stuff um 1 minus cosine squared x times cosine to the one-half X sine X DX so when we have an odd strip went off now we use Pythagorean identity to make everything besides this guy into cosine once we do that do you see a substitution that's going to work don't worry about Distributing you don't have to do that don't worry about that your substitution what's your substitution going to be okay then d u equal oh derivative of cosine X what is it negative sign very good so we know that negative d u equals sine X DX that is what we have here so let's keep on going can you all tell me what's going to be in my integral once I make that substitution so we'll strip it off we've got all cosines we're making our substitution what's this change too one minus what perfect keep going what next oh good so we still have U cosines u u to the second U to the one half yeah don't forget that negative okay the sine DX is negative d u okay tell me what we do next okay I love that so moving up here negative integral of we'll move the negative out front we'll keep our bounds of integration tribute yeah let's distribute the U so right now once you make the substitution it's a lot easier to make the substitution than distribute rather than Distributing then make the substitution there's less to have to deal with so when we do our distribution we get U to the one half minus one minus oh when we multiply Powers together do we add them or multiply them you add them so you're the first let's get that one right two over let's see four over two plus one over two that's five over two you get bypass I hate to say but use a calculator if you have to I don't care get it right okay don't multiply those and give me one oh my goodness uh add the powders you get two plus a half well that's two and a half five halves that's what that is you guys okay with that one finish that off go ahead you would if you added one plus a half that'd be one and a half that's three halves but if you add two words did you get three halves over you did three halves over three halves did you get U to the seven halves over seven halves what am I missing do I need a plus c here oh no we're doing it no because it's definitely okay so good what am I missing front of the whole thing in front of the whole do you guys have brackets yeah yeah you should because we're subtracting this whole integral okay so we're subtracting this thing what's going to happen here let's simplify this what's it look like okay so negative negative one two three two thirds U to the three halves okay I like it then what plus two sevenths beautiful would you want to change your balance on this one right that's a good question that depends on you if you want to change the bounds then you should have already done it correct yeah if you don't let's let's say this some of you guys made a little bit of mistake on that last test let's say you don't change the balance do you plug in 0 and pi over 2 here no no what do you put here you'd have to put whatever you did it should have to be code yeah whatever you is you have to put cosine back in there then you plug in 0 to pi over two does that make sense to you if you go ahead I like changing bounds personally I think it's easier or at least it's more straightforward so right here what I would do is it's okay we start with x's so if x equals pi over 2 then U equals and if x equals zero then U equals and we just plug that into cosine so if we do that we've got cosine of what's cosine of pi over two zero and if we plug in pi let's see uh if we plug in zero what's cosine of zero one okay the only problem that we're going to have here if you do it this way please be careful this is probably good for you guys to see this is why we're doing it right now where's the zero go the bottom top the top goes on the top because pi over 2 got mapped to zero does that make sense to you okay where's the one go on the bottom left zero got mapped to one show fans should feel okay with that one okay if you do it this way it's hard if you do it this way what happens right here so other way if you had this you'd have to do cosine for your U and then plug in the actual values and it's fine you go ahead and if you someone who had that on the paper go ahead and do it make sure you do the same thing we did if you do it this way if you actually change bounds you should have remembered from your Calculus one that when you flip your integral become your sign changes do you remember that property yeah if you flip this you go okay let's make it from zero to one let's put it in the correct order negative becomes positive it changes that to eventually okay we're done okay and now it becomes well something we can do we don't have to re-substitute that cosine so this would be two-thirds U to the three halves minus two sevenths U to the seven halves we already did that now let's practice this one if I do this if I change my balance do I have to put cosine X back in for my U no I'm going to change them these are now in terms of U from zero to one those are used now they were X's now we've they're used we just showed that we get to plug in one we get to plug in zero we don't have to plug them into cosine because you already did over here that's how we changed it so we'd get two-thirds one to the three halves minus two sevenths one to the seven halves I always plug these in in case something funky happens okay we get zero okay that's going to be zero minus zero so nothing's going to happen over here one to any power is still one so two thirds minus two sevenths how much is two-thirds minus two-sevenths eight twenty four okay eight over twenty one Michael got to be negative zero to one we had one to zero with a negative so when we flip that the negative changes to a positive so we are changing you caught it we are changing signs though this would be negative correct but if I have a negative out front already it becomes positive that's the idea I want to show fans if that made sense to you if you did the other way you wouldn't do this you still have zero to pi over two but you'd be plugging it into cosine here and cosine there I want to make very very sure that you're clear on that one are you guys clear on that yeah yeah you would um if you didn't if you left it with the original balance you would get negative 0 to pi over two like that with all this junk and then you have negative two-thirds U but the U would become cosine X 3 has plus because you would distribute the negative seven halves cosine X to the and then you plug in not zero to one you plug in 0 to pi over two well if you look at that it's going to be the same cosine of pi over two this is zero zero cosine of pi over two this is zero but the zeros aren't zero cosine of zero is one cosine of zero is so this is negative two-thirds plus two-sevenths oh look at that it's exactly the same time is something huh because we should also subtract them so it'd be uh shoot negative zero plus zero minus negative two-thirds plus two-sevenths is how it would really look that's the same thing this if you distributed zero two-thirds minus two-sevenths that's the same same idea exactly makes sense now even more sense I know it made sense before but now it's like extra sense anyway we're going to talk about one more thing in this section how to do some integrals that maybe don't have just Sines and cosine but I'm practicing with Sines and cosines all day long all less involved let's look at something else oh by the way did you have any questions okay all right good too late so what happens if you have something like a sine cosine but tangent and probably something else like secant we we grouped sine and cosine together because the derivative of one gives you the other one does that make sense yeah and we group tangent and secant together because derivative one kind of gives you the other one especially with like secant squared and things and cotangent cosecant so those ones are grouped together because we it's possible to do if you don't have that scenario you have to change things to sine and cosine and work in a different way I'll give you that example much later so like uh at least another day so what about integrals that involve tangent and secant or cotangent I'm hoping that you understand the the ideas that we use here we're going to use the same exact ideas here because the code the tangent and the cotangent secant and the cosecant they work really similar and the identities are very similar so let's take a look at what we do with this one and we'll use a corollary for this one so here's new just like we have rules for sine cosine we're going to have rules for tangent and secant if tangent is odd so if tangent's an odd power if the power of tangent is odd what we're going to do is something kind of fancy we're going to strip off not only a tangent but we're also going to strip off a secant so we're going to keep a tangent and a secant I'll explain one second so the power of tangent is odd foreign keep one factor of tangent X secant x in fact I'm going to write it backwards so we're going to keep a tangent we're going to strip up for the tangent as secant keep one factor of secant x tangent X I'm going to write this way because we're going to make a little bit more sense right now remember the idea behind this I hope that you do the idea is that we're going to break up a little piece right yeah we're going to break up a little piece so that we can take the derivative so if tangent is odd if tangent's odd like three we're going to strip off a tangent that's going to make the remaining power a 2 tangent to the second power it has an identity it's going to change into secant hey what's the derivative of secant secant that's why we're keeping that because this will allow us to do a substitution so if the power of tangent is odd keep one factor of secant tangent and use tangent squared x equals secant squared x minus 1. what that does that changes all but this tangent and to secant then you can use the substitution the derivative of secant is secant tangent and you're pretty much good to go now let's say that the power of so we check first the power of tangent okay if it's odd you're good then if it's not well we're going to check secant let's say the power of secant is even if I receive it is even what we're going to do is what we're going to do keep or strip off a sequence squared and use secant squared x equals let's see what would that be tangent squared x plus one if this is the case if we have an even power of secant well then what we can do is strip off the even the rest of the even and keep a secant squared if we keep a secant squared and use this to translate everything else to the tangent hey tell me something what's the derivative of tangent secant squared that's going to allow us to make a substitution tell you what I want to try at least one of these right now just to get it in our heads real quick so the stuff makes sense Okay so oh you'll find a lot of similar patterns to cyanosa same idea it should be a little bit easier now that we have this stuff down question oh so those those two definitions those work for either both of those cotangent or second two like this right so if and I'm kind of putting this up here for this one too um you could read this way if the power of cotangent is odd keep one factor of cosecant cotangent and use cotangent squared equals cosecant minus one I'll use that one does that make sense to you if the power of cosecant is even strip off cosecant squared and use the appropriate identity you guys with me yeah okay so make sure your identities are are good to go and will be absolutely fine very similar ideas here which is why I'm not going over this one completely separate they're the same it's the same thing let's try one I'll give you one in a while too but let's try one with Tangent and CQ first thank you all right let's go through the whole process here we're going to look at the power of tangent first and if it fits our Paradigm we're good to go if it doesn't well then we got to look at the power of secant so let's look at the power tangent what do you notice about it sometimes and that's great that fits right here so what we do with the odd power of tangent we're going to make it even we're going to strip off a power of tangent but we're also going to strip off a power of secant so what am I going to write as far as the tangent goes tangent to a forum yep tangent to the fourth and I'm also going to do secant to the second now here's what we're going to do with that we just stripped off the tangent we just stripped off the secant I'm going to have secant x tangent X DX I want to make sure that you guys are out with the so far original okay with that it's just some algebra it's just understanding that this is the same thing I'm just doing this on purpose because right now I'm working to make a substitution that's the idea now do I want to change secant squared no no something I'm thinking wait a minute that that's even should I do that no the idea here is you're trying to make this so your substitution has this derivative this is the derivative I want if I change this to a tangent I'd have a substitution of a tangent what's the derivative of tangent squares is it this no if I change this to a secant what's the derivative of a secant this that's why we're going to go about it this way okay this not so much maybe we manipulate the tangent a little bit I don't want tan to the fourth I want to make it look like my identity here so I'm going to do a tan squared x squared so the whole idea is identify what identity you're going to be using then use it if we have odd power of tangent strip off a tangent and a secant then make your tangent into a secant in order to do that we've got to have our identity just right so setting to the fourth now I'm going to do tan squared squared how much is Tan squared x what is that so we're going to have secant squared x minus 1 all squared then a secant squared x times a secant X tangent X DX so 10 second recap before we actually go I'll go on and do this thing are you guys okay the idea that if tangent is odd we're stripping off at that secant tangent yeah this is because we're going to work towards making the substitution we do that by making it look like it fits the identity doing the identity and then doing a very simple substitution if we do our simple substitution U equals what don't distribute now please don't do that you'll have to do it later you go secant x d u equal what's what's uh do you equal this ladies and gentlemen is why this works when you strip off the secant x tangent X you're actually stripping It Off so that you can do this so that secant x tangent X DX will equal your du you'll change this to a u squared minus 1 squared you'll change this to a u but this whole piece why we stripped it off was to allow this to happen the derivative of secant x is this therefore d u equals secant x tangents DX I want to show Advantage if that makes sense so you can follow that uh what I want it's very simple after this what would you do you spoil and then distribute everything that's right so distribute all this crap distribute everything and then do your your integral go ahead and do that at home it'll take us maybe a minute next time we come in uh just make sure at the very end you're gonna have to substitute back in for whatever you whatever you use so more torture I mean fun uh more calculus so what we've learned is that if we have some integrals which follow some trigonometric patterns such as we have Sines and cosines where sine is odd or cosine is odd or they're both odd and they're both even we can do stuff with that we can work with them with following the patterns that I've given you earlier in this section we're also moving on to what happens we have tangents and secants of course we use sine and cosine together because the derivative of one gives you the other that's why they work we use tangent and secant together because the derivative of one kind of gives you the other they're related as far as their derivatives so what that means is we can use substitutions a lot of the time if we do a little manipulation same thing worked with cotangent and cosecant so here's the ideas if you have a power of tangent or cotangent that is odd we're going to keep a secant tangent or likewise a cosecant cotangent and use tangent squared equals secant squared minus 1 or cotangent squared equals cosecant squared minus one do you see the similarity between the COS and the the other functions it's very similar again the idea is is this you're stripping off a piece because you're going to be doing a substitution so basically we're stripping off the derivative of what we're trying to get in our integral so if we strip off look at this if we strip off a secant tangent we better be substituting to making everything else in the integral a secant does that make sense I'll say that again because some of you guys weren't really listening here if we're stripping off a secant tangent everything else in our integral better change to a secant because the derivative of secant is secant tangent this is what we're doing we're stripping off the derivative if we strip off a secant squared if we keep that one then everything else in our integral better be changing to what tangent because the derivative of tangent is secant squared so we're kind of taking a piece of this a wave of our integral just stripping off a little bit that way we can make a substitution that allows us to do our integral just a basic U substitution I'm going to try one more with uh tangent secant to show you what that idea is like I think last time we did one where tangent was odd I haven't shown you one where secant is even so we're going to do that so here we go let's suppose we have an integral from zero to pi over four of the square root of 10x times C great to the sixth power of x to the sixth power let's see if this follows our one of our patterns see if it fits so what would this fit as would this fit as sine and cosine of course I don't even have those as far as tangent and sigan goes what does this fit is tangent odd or secant even which one oh it does I don't care if they're both even we have one or the other either tangent's got to be odd for us or secant's got to be even which one do we have okay so we don't fall up here we're falling right here the power of secant is even no problem well then we can do this what are we supposed to do if the power of secant is even we're going to strip off a secant squared so basically here's what has to happen with this if you're gonna if you fit this pattern we're gonna strip off a secant squared so this is going to become secant to the fourth power you with me the reason why this works so nice is because if this is even I can strip off that secant squared and I have something that can be raised such that I have sink into the second power in there then I can use my identity change everything into tangents and make my substitution so so check this out we're going to follow my my ideas here we'll have zero to pi over four not really any calculus happening we're just we're fitting this to our pattern we're making this stuff work we'll have tangent to that one half power we'll have secant tell me what I should have secant two there fourth very good times what squared this is what I mean by stripping off a secant squared we're taking this at well is that still secant to the sixth of course it is I'm stripping this off here's why if you didn't catch me the first time I know it's kind of out there when I'm just talking it through but in the example hopefully you see this because this was even when I strip off that secant squared it's still even does that make sense that means I can write this as secant squared to some power if I can write this as secant squared to some power I can use this identity to change everything into tangents this is the idea if I have this tangent I'm good if I can change this to tangent I'm good because then the substitution hey what's the derivative of tangent that's why we strip that off so the idea is strip up a piece use the rest of it to change it into whatever this one is the other trigonometric function so if I have tangent and secant and I have a secant squared I need to change this into tangent so that my substitution will actually work does that make sense you would strip this off and then do something with Tangent that'd be silly because the derivative of secant is not the secant squared the derivative of tangent is secant squared so even good deal we'll strip off a secant squared it's still even that's the point here if it's still even then what we can do is keep the tangent to the one-half power that's great seeking to the fourth no no how are we going to write secant to the fourth power what do you think yeah perfect and we'll keep this exactly the way it is I want to know how many people understand why I'm writing this as secant Square to the second how many people understand that why what's that going to allow me to do yeah that's right we're going to use our identity so this one do I want to change that this one do I want to change that yeah this one no this is going to allow me to make that substitution do I want to change this one oh yeah 0 to pi over 4 we're going to have Tan x to the one half in here well this is why we did this because this was still even I can write this as secant squared squared it's it's our our secant squared which we want because we're going to do that that change here we're going to use this identity and it still raises some power that's fine we can deal with that but I had to have a secant squared to be able to do this to change everything into tangent so this becomes 1 plus tangent X squared let's see if that makes sense to you even cool strip one off it's still even that's why we did this if it's still even I can write this as secant squared to some power if that was to the sixth power that wouldn't be a problem that would just be a three that was an eighth power no problem that would be just a four the idea is if this is even I can strip it off I still have something that's even which allows me to do this idea once I have this the secant squared now I get to use my identity to change everything into tangent except for this guide because I want to use this thing for my substitution you have to have the derivative of whatever you're going to substitute that's the basics of U substitution is the derivative has to be there so if we're trying to change everything into tangent we've got to have a secant squared otherwise our substitution will not work so it has to be okay with what we've done so far cool now should I distribute right now or should I do our substitution right now I would you can distribute but there's lots of other stuff right so if you change everything to you now be a little bit easier so right now we're going to do our substitution can you please tell me and I'll make a little area here for this what is our substitution going to be then d u equals secant squared x DX this is why we had to have this that's why this whole thing works so now this part is equal to U that's brilliant one more thing I'd recommend to you right now is if you have definite integrals which we do here sometimes it's really nice to change your balance so I would do that if this was my problem I'd be changing bounds right now which I'm going to do so changing bounds and look over here when X in the cell I showed I said when X is pi over 4 then U is whatever and when X is zero then you is whatever we get so when we do it next to our substitution makes a lot of sense to do that if x is pi over four can you tell me what's tangent of pi over four one then U is one right there that's already a little bit nicer when X is zero how much is tangent of zero zero now what happens is to calculus One Step but I'll make sure you get it now that we've changed bounds when we get down to the integral will we be resubstituting Tan x for U no no you change bounds you don't need to do that that's why I do it now so let's see what happens uh why don't you tell me bless you don't tell me bless you I said bless you but you tell me I I love to be blessed bless you too um you tell me what I'm going to write what's my integral now one zero and one which one one to zero zero to one one so zero to one zero okay what's inside U to the what yeah perfect yeah U to the one half and then what one is we really want to make sure we don't miss any of those Powers because that would really blow this thing out of water so we have U to the one half we got it tangent is U so U the one half we've got a one we got a one we've got a plus we got A plus we get a tangent squared so U squared whole thing being squared what happens to my secant squared x DX what does that mean this has to match your variable it does we're good to go can you guys do the rest of it from here yeah go for it do your simple integral you're gonna be Distributing a lot of course and then evaluated let's see if you guys get to work on it on your own let's see if you guys get the same thing I get two okay let me get a work check from you did you distribute the same that I did the same thing I did yes good fractions use your calculator if you have to I hope that you don't but make sure your fractions are correct foreign keep on working are your fractions right ah the one half five halves nine halves you know what the hard part the hard part is really getting down to here right is using this stuff this I'm hoping you guys are okay with this is this is old stuff this is just distribution making sure you know how to do fractions adding fractions and then doing some basic basic integrals U to the one half integral U to the one half is U to the three halves over three halves two U to the seven halves over seven halves either the 11 halves over 11 halves and then all of these bottom denominators just move up to the numerator so in our case we would have two-thirds U to the three halves plus four sevenths U to the seven halves plus two elevenths U to the eleven halves two moves up two moves up is multiplied by two two moves up no big deal quick hitting that if you're okay with with that one so far okay now this is what I was talking about earlier I want to make sure that you get it do you at this point have to substitute back in your tangent here if you didn't change bounds would you have to plug in your tangent here okay so what are our bounds of integration where are we going to again so we're going to plug in one we're going to plug in zero we're going to do it right to our U's that makes it kind of nice so I'm going to do this in my head because we have some fairly simple numbers this was nice for us if I plug in one one too many power gives you one so basically we get two-thirds two-thirds plus four sevenths plus two elevenths if I plug in 0 I'm going to get 0 and 0 and 0 but I really want to check that and make sure you're checking that so this would be minus zero so essentially we just got to add up all of these fractions which of course you can do in your head and get 328 over 231 I mean easy yeah obviously I did that in my head I didn't do that in my head I'm not going to waste some time adding fractions right now I had that done beforehand so uh 328 over 231 is what you would get if you added up all those things together should pinch feel okay with this one I'm not going to waste time doing the the basic stuff this is really it right this is the stuff you guys should know already so hopefully we're okay are we okay you want to do one more I don't think we've done a cotangent coaster here let's let's take out one of those see how that works uh are there any questions on this before I erase it this time at all so you're saying that if an original problem I've been like seeking to the tent then we would just if this is the same thing with cp2 the 10th you can go about it exactly the same way the only difference is this would be a secant squared correct and you have seeking to the eight this would be secant squared and this would be a four the only problem with doing this is that when you get down to your U sub you have to distribute a lot because you'd have one plus u squared to the fourth so you'd have to distribute all of that stuff you have lots of terms there yeah right so that's it can be done but it's a lot of distribution more no you sure it's doable it's just no just wondering if you could just split it twice and then do two at some point you will be Distributing somewhere with this stuff because if you do split it right you'll have multiplication and when you do um when you do your your identity right here from here to here you get a plus after you get a plus you will have to distribute all that stuff that's the idea okay so last one before I give you some other ideas on this section let's work over here this time okay so let's check our pattern out we know one for sine and cosine we know one now for secant and tangent secant and tangent or actually I should say this way cotangent and cosecant were really really similar to uh tangent and secant so the same thing that we just did with Tangent and secant we can basically do it with cotangent and cosecant of course the derivative is a little bit different so it's got a negative in there we'll have to be aware of as long as we don't mess up that negative it works really similar even the identity is pretty much the exact same thing so it's really close so let's check it out which one does this fit which pattern is this the one where power of tangent or cotangent is odd or the one where our secant or cosecant is even which one yeah the cotangent is odd so that fits this top one says the power of tangent or cotangent is odd we're going to do something what are we going to do with this okay so that's what I want you to do right now do the first step don't just wait for me do it yourself you know what I'm gonna need more room than that so if cotangent is odd you strip off cosecant cotangent that's the idea you strip one of those things off let me see if you wrote what'd you write what'd you write down what does cotangent become foreign X cotangent X DX I would do that because that's the way it looks in my head when I do derivatives that's the way it looks show fans be okay with that one so far now I need you to understand that don't just follow this as a pattern okay really understand the process the idea here is that this is supposed to be a derivative of something is this the derivative think about this when you're doing these problems is this the derivative of cotangent or a system derivative of cosecant so the derivative of cosecant you with me yeah what that means is that I want all of this to become cosecant am I going to change the cosecant no am I going to change the cotangent that's why it's written this way for you use cotangent with this identity right here make it into cosecant you're stripping off these pieces as a derivative so you want to change everything else so that when you do the substitution the derivative exists if you do this and you start using an identity on cosecant and change it to cotangent the derivative of cotangent is not cosecant cotangent it would be using this one it would be uh the derivative of cotangent would be the cosecant squared so we could do it that way so again the idea is when we're stripping it off we're actually getting a derivative here change everything else to the trigonometric function that gives you this derivative is that clear so change cosecant no the derivative of cosecant is this change cotangent yeah yes so in our case well probably got to write a little bit different cotangent to the fourth is not our identity how can I rewrite that please I don't want to change cosecants those are those are great for us that's going to give us our substitution in just a second so we write it so that we can actually use our identity our identity says if we have cotangent squared that's the same thing as cosecant squared minus 1 squared believe it or not we're almost done almost people ladies and gentlemen you're okay so far I want to know if you understand the reasoning behind what we're doing here we're trying to get all of these to be cosecanted because this is the derivative cosecant so once you have that as soon as you have this downward they're all the same and the derivative is right here what should you be doing that's like the definition of when to use a u substitution is when you have one piece that if you take it out with a substitution and you take a derivative and the derivative is in there it'll work now here's the deal you do got to be pretty good about your your derivatives of these things we don't use the derivative of cosecant a lot but you still get to know it derivative of secant is positive secant tangent derivative of cosecant is negative cosecant cotangent let's switch over that negative so negative d u equals cosecant X cotangent X DX and now this is exactly what we have here and that will let us do our substitution I'm going to move up here can you please tell me what this integral will look like after I do all of this substitution integral of what's this become e squared yeah good so this is u u squared minus 1 squared cool we got U to the fourth power no problem this whole thing is equal to negative to you do not forget about that negative that's a big deal so negative d u and now let's do a simple integral tell me some things that you're going to do here negative up front very good what else you're going to have to distribute so negative comes out front if we distribute We Got U to the fourth minus two U squared plus one if I did it right did I do it right yeah yeah okay times U to the fourth now what do it again negative integral U to the eighth minus two U to the sixth plus u to the fourth b u can you guys do that integral yeah a piece of cake negative just don't forget that you either need to distribute the negative now while you're doing this or have it up front because it will distribute eventually one ninth U to the ninth minus and lastly tell me some other things that we're going to do here please substitute we do have to substitute so we don't want E I don't want U's we start with x's you better do it give me some x's and then distribute negative so I'm gonna do all those steps at once we're gonna have negative 1 9 U becomes cosecant to the ninth power of x we're going to have plus because we're Distributing the negative 2 7 cosecant to the seventh power of x plus one-fifth cosecant to the fifth power of X and finally let's see yeah that means we're done five bags and one over nine oh yeah you're right I'm sorry I missed that okay good catch that should be negative you can Factor this if you want to that's fine um I will try to get you to get the basic idea of getting down to here once you get to here really we should know how to do that right so if you get down here and go I want to factor that go ahead and Factor it you want factors for fractions factors for fractions I only care I want to make sure that you are good this is really what I'm trying to teach you is up to this point this stuff should be your Basics after that nice show if Angie feel okay with this one with this one okay those are the basic three if we have Sines and cosines you have patterns for that if you have secants and tangents now you have patterns for that if you have cozy and cotangent is no problem what happens if they don't fit those patterns so we're going to talk about that right now like if the cotangent you had one more cotangent in that last problem some of them can't I mean some of them there's no real good way to do them um someone like I'm going to show you the only way around doing this like like this one like if I were to give you that if it fits the patterns I've given you for goodness sakes you use the patterns and do them okay if it doesn't fit exactly sometimes we can change it so that it fits a good pattern sometimes we can't if it doesn't fit any pattern at all like this one does that fit anything it's got secants and tangents right but they're not multiplied together one's being divided this doesn't count this is more like tangent and that's actually a cosine if you move that to the numerator this tangent cosine so that's really not exactly what we're looking at so one big hint for you is if it doesn't fit the pattern if it doesn't fit so first thing you don't don't do this first okay check the pattern first if there's Sines and cosines you can you can work with it you can work with any sine and cosines I've given you if they're secant and tangent and it fits so that either tangent's odd or secants even you can do it if you have cotangent cosecant where cotangent is odd or cosecant is even you can do it if it doesn't fit those things then one thing you try after you check that see if you can change it to Sines and cosines using those identities and then see if it'll work so let's try to change it so the note that I that you probably should write down is if it doesn't fit the pattern try changing it to Sines and cosines but that's it though so for others not covered try converting the sine cosine foreign so let me show you some ideas that I would do if I was looking at this problem the first thing I would do is I look for an identity so that I could just nail right off the bat now this one's pretty close but that's not an identity one plus tangent squared would be an identity that'll be easy because 1 plus tangent squared would be secant squared secant squared of six squared to give you one you'd get X hey that'd be nice and we're not that lucky okay so that's not an identity don't create your own identity some of us like to do that in this class uh instead work with this thing with identities that you do know or if you don't try to break pieces apart so first thing I'd say is I don't really like secant squared secant squared isn't cosine so one thing I would try is I would split up this integral into one over secant squared x minus tangent squared X over secant squared x the reason I'm doing that is because I know that 1 over secant squared x is actually the same as what cosine squared remember convert to Sines and cosines that's one way we can do it so then this becomes cosine squared x and let's take a look at what this actually is what this actually would become this is tan squared x times cosine squared x believe it yeah this is cosine squared x that's what that is so 1 over secant squared is cosine squared understood yeah well what's tangible so tangent squared is sine squared x over cosine squared x times cosine squared x what happens here that's fantastic so just by doing a little bit of a change here by pulling those those fractions apart and by using our identities for what's 1 over secant squared is for what tangent is what secant one over secant squared we can simplify this fraction from this nasty thing to this really nice thing I guess your opinion should be okay with that one hey have we done any calculus right now yeah this is trigonometry purely tricky exactly the next step is going to be trigonometry because this is kind of awesome uh there's an identity and if you want to look it up right now you can look it up this is actually an identity do you know what it is negative one please don't say one or negative points this would be one that would be one this is this is not a negative one it's not the way that this stuff works uh no no it's not it's not but if you want to look it up go ahead and look it up I think I know what it is okay Rob no sine 2x perfect does it help to know your trig identities because if you didn't if you didn't know that look at this you know how to do cosine to evens don't you you know how to do that uh you'd have to so you'd have to do this one you have to do this one independently and then you have to put them all together but if we know our identity we go hey look at it let's go Santa can you do this that's now A Piece of Cake this would be like I would do the use up in my head I don't write out the U Subs for a lot of these trig ones because they're so easy and they take and we do so many of them especially like you found out into your last homework or this homework I'm sorry when you have like uh cosine squared of 2x well then you're going to be getting one half one plus cosine of 4X that angle is going to change if you do a use of right off the bat with that you're gonna have like eight U Subs per problem that is going to suck so I just do in my head I go okay what's the integral of cosine it's positive sign whatever's in my hand I don't change but I divide by the derivative of what is on my hand it's like the opposite of a chain of a uh a chain rule instead of multiplying by derivative you just divide by derivative and that works does that make sense to you it says doing U substitution that's a u Sub in my head I'm doing U equals 2x right derivative is two DX equals du over two that's where the over two is coming from plus C lets me know I'm done so if I should be okay with that one identities are nice try to use those and the ones that and the ones that don't follow the pattern you are going to have to change the sine and cosine for most of them once you do that please for your sake look at some identities and try to work with them just follow the correct identities down and you'll be good to go okay we move on now there's one more thing that we haven't talked about that will give you one example with and we'll call it a day um noticed in all of these patterns that these angles are always the same have you ever wondered what if the angles aren't the same have you wondered that we're going to we're going to do one like that right now so what happens where the angles of sine and cosine are different so for integrals where sine and cosine have different angles try using these three identities again of course with trigonometry we almost always go back to identities at some point even with our basic patterns we're using identities same thing happens here if you've got integrals with two different angles this is what you do there's three cases there's where you have two sides where you have a sine the cosine or where they have two cosines there's only three three cases so let's suppose I have sine times sine where the angles are to put different where the angles are different you know what I'm going to do more room let's write that down but I'm going to write it just over here a little bit or where we have a sign and the cosine before the angles are different or lastly where we have a cosine and a cosine where the angles are different here's some identities I don't know if you've ever seen these before you may have I'm not sure you probably have somewhere but we don't use them very often here they are so if you have sine of something times sine of something where your some things are different here should I do it probably something you're going to want to write down and have next to you when you're doing your homework at least I would probably just it's nice here thank you you're not allergic to this are you foreign yes minus cosine okay good and that one cool and okay write them all down look up here when you're done that way I can talk at you we're gonna do an example here so continue writing then let me know that you're done and then we'll do an example foreign you get this perfectly right sign for sign pluses and minuses sign for sign as well okay good so let's check this out if I hadn't told you this could you do that problem well you might you might be able to change this cosine 2X I'm sure there's an uh identity for that one but we have an idea that will change this correctly and make it a lot quicker a lot easier for us so let's check it out we got sine x cosine two x do you see what I mean about different angles yeah so what this says is this would be our MX it's just 1X this should blow away which one are we at top one middle one bottom one so this is our 1X this is our 2x it just basically says look at this angle look at this angle do this with it so when we're doing this with it we still maintain our balance of integration we're just going to do our identity here so what's the first thing that we're going to do one half's got to be there what are we ultimately going to do with that one half no we're not contributed you can pull it out okay so I'm going to draw my bracket here let's change this using this identity tell me the first thing I'm going to write inside of my bracket sorry sine of what uh good it just says this angle minus this angle x minus not 2x minus that x minus 2x okay what else there's a plus holding those together and then another sign and then what that's right perfect don't forget your DX's let's simplify a little bit what do we got here okay what now nature wait son of what sign of combine them Negative X you okay with sine of negative X are you first I want to make I get some weird looks on that one like what are you doing uh what's x minus 2x okay you can do this stuff okay they're inside the parentheses x plus two x's some of you are thinking so hard you're missing the easy stuff that happens a lot in this class quick hitting if you're okay with that so far the reason why this exists is so that you can actually combine the angles all right you want this this one's crazy I mean this yeah I can buy this negative X and now this is an issue because we don't want to end with a sine of a Negative X we want sine of x we want to end with that or whatever we have here so I mean cosine actually you didn't identity for this one sine of negative x equals good it's an odd function so when we do this we go right this is not a problem this will be one half zero to pi over two a negative sine of x plus sine of 3x DX let me ask you something can you do this integral that's a piece of cake it's not cosine what's uh what's the can you do this integral yeah it's a piece of cake too no problems let's do the integrals what's the integral of let me write this up here okay one half's going to be there no problem let's create a bracket here so I don't lose anything what's the integral of sine X can you tell me negative cosine negative cosine so much carefully I'm gonna do some math in my head here if this gives you negative cosine this gives you cosine X this would give you integral of sine X is negative cosine so negative integral of negative sine X is positive cosine X sure if needs to be okay with that one double negative okay double negative two wrongs make a right here so let's do the next one what's this going to give you we'll give it negative cosine 3x okay so instead of plus I'm going to have minus cosine 3x over three that's a little U Sub in your head for the over three so when you're doing these do the integral no problem negative so minus cosine negative so minus cosine three x over the derivative of three so it needs to be okay with that one good deal now what is definitely should to distribute that if you really wanted to you don't have to you can wait to the very end I would I like dealing with this and that separately you could actually divide out a one-third if you want you could do divide out of one third this would become three cosine x minus cosine 3x not a problem that would get rid of that fraction in there so whatever you want to do as far as this goes this is just algebra just plug in some numbers and doing it so I'll leave the one half just remember that in here when you when you evaluate you'll have cosine of pi over two minus cosine of 3 times pi over 2 that'll give you nice numbers should I bother to plug in zero yes for heaven's sakes yes minus cosine of zero minus cosine of three times zero one half over three uh I don't think I forgot anything but you let me know if I have have I forgot anything no okay so we got the one half we got the one half Bagel bracket you need the big old bracket this is the evaluation of pi over two so cosine pi over two cosine three times pi over two over three are you guys okay with that one minus no problem because you subtracted this cosine of zero minus cosine of three times zero over three let's work it out so this will give us one half big bracket don't lose things here what's cosine of pi over two how about cosine of negative I'm sorry cosine of a three pi over two zero zero zero over three big difference cosine of one cosine plus zero is one how about this this sine of zero will be one minus one third don't forget about three this is one third you okay if you're about three this whole thing goes to zero you go wait a minute it doesn't make sense you have an area that's zero you can complex analysis uh what happens here so this is zero one half zero minus two I did right I get Negative one-third did you get Negative one-third yes that make sense to you guys yeah 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 7.3:  Integrals By Trigonometric Substitution
okay so we're going to talk about trigonometric substitution and where this stems from is all right you can do some integrals great we can do substitutions we can do integration by parts we can do a lot of trigonometric integrals but what if someone was to give you an integral like this one let's one run through our list of things that we can do does this fit in integration table anywhere no okay is a substitution going to work no no cuz if I substitute for this the derivative is something with an X I don't see an X not going to do it uh okay is integration by parts going to work no not really is because well we have a piece of an integral this thing would be the other piece that that' be that'd be bad we take basically do integration by parts when we have a product in there somewhere all right well if we don't have that um is it a trig integral does it have signs or cosines then we got to have something else here's the something else the idea is let's let's kind of change this let's think about this in kind of an out of the box kind of way let me just consider theare < TK of 1 + X2 now somewhere along the way someone said well wait a second you know what this looks a whole lot like Pythagorean theorem whole lot like it in fact this looks like I could do 1^ 2 + X2 same thing yeah mhm well then they said wait a second if that looks like Pythagorean theorem the stuff that we would get by Pythagorean theorem then maybe we can make a triangle out of this thing so they say I can't do it like this well this looks really similar so let's make a triangle and see if we can actually use that here's a crazy idea so we create this triangle and what we're going to do is we're going to fit this piece of junk that we can't deal with as one of the sides of our triangle the whole deal that you're going to develop here this in this whole section um I don't really want you memorizing a lot of the formulas I'm going to give you there's only three of them I don't want you to have to SK sit there and memorize with flashcards I want you to understand the concept what is actually happening here what's actually happening is that we're going to take this and we're going to make it a side of a triangle now there's a very specific way that you do this you have to tell whether it's a leg or whether it's the what's the longest side of a right triangle hypoten whether it's the leg or the hypotenuse it's not hard to tell what would this be a leg or a hyot that has to be the hypotenuse the only way that happens is if I have a leg squar plus a leg squared then I take a square root that gives me the hypotenuse remember this A S Plus b^2 = c^2 mm check it out if it's this hey look at if it's this then this thing stands for a hypotenuse are you with me on that one if it's this what's that it's a leg it's got to be a leg do I know which one well we'll talk about that minute you can choose we we'll we'll pick correctly there's only one correct choice but we get to choose or if it's the other way around that's also oh sorry you know what that was stupid same thing I meant this or if it's that that's also a leg do you guys get the idea here so somehow we can fit this square root of something plus something or some something minus something as part of a triangle in our case this ISS wait a minute the only way that I can make this fit a triangle is if this is the hypotenuse and this is my Angle now here's the deal for the rest of your triangle your idea is going to be to try to make the sides in some relationship that allows you to create tangent s or secant where you have a variable over a constant so I'm I'm going to do this I'm gonna say wait a second if this is < TK of 1^2 + x^2 can you tell me the lengths of these sides it's a piece of cake one of them's x one of them's one that's it now if I do this one and X that's a cotangent cotangent is really hard to deal with okay you know what I kind of skipped a point we're going to use a relationship here that allows us to not work with this one but work with a trigonometric relationship of the other two sides so I don't like the square root that's really hard to work with so I want a trigonometric identity that lets us work with the other two that don't have square roots the easy parts of this does that makes sense so we make it easier if I do this 1 /x well then I'm not really going to get something nice I'm going to get cotangent does don't have some nice that does have an identity but we try to stick with easier identities so I'm not going to do 1 /x I'm going to do X over One X over one now here's the plan the plan was if this is part of our triangle and now we have our other two sides X and one let's pick a trigonometric identity trigonometric function actually that allows us to relate the two other sides in a really nice fashion for instance if I look at tangent tangent is for this specific triangle how much just tangent x x x over one or tan Theta is simply simply X that's great I I I really need you to get this idea before we go any further I want you to really see what's happening what's happening is we don't know how to do this we take this part away we go you know what that looks a whole lot like part of triangle with Pythagorean theorem let's make it be part of a triangle by Pythagorean theorem then we can find the other two sides of that right triangle well it's really easy it's kind of given to you one of them is one one of them one of them is X we put them in this relationship that way when we do tangent of our angle we get simply opposite over adjacent we get X over one or tangent theta equals x so hands feel okay with that idea it will become more clear I promise we do a lot of examples um I'll also give you some the formulas but I'm going to teach this to you in a way that it makes sense not that you just follow the pattern Okie doie it does have to make sense to you now and it'll become easier if it does this is what is awesome about this you agree that t x correct talal x tanal x that allows us to do a trigonometric substitution so we'll have an integral we'll still have a square root notice we're not substituting for the square root we can't do that because there's nothing to to to get the derivative away square root we're still going to have a one are we still gonna have an x no no instead what is our x s so we're gonna have tan wait a minute just tan Theta this was x s hey look at that tan Theta is X this becomes tan^ squ Theta I want to show up hands you feel okay with this so far remember all those times your Calculus one teacher maybe it was me uh told you don't forget your DX don't forget your D Theta don't forget those remember that and how some of you forget the DX and all that junk that you think is irrelevant here's why it's not irrelevant if you just leave that as DX does this match your no no this is an issue these have to match your variables have to match so what in the world do we do with that DX it's really similar to doing a use substitution really similar so we have tan Theta here we have X can you figure out what DX is take a what's the derivative of so equals how much ah now we know so this part becomes our DX I'm going to work over here but um it it is it's not a really complicated idea but it's kind of it's new for you I know it's brand new so I want to make sure that you guys are okay with exactly what's going on here before we go any further you understand we can't do this the way it is correct correct can't do it so we pull it off you understand that this is a hypotenuse of a right triangle it's got the plus there it's a leg squ plus a leg squar and then we take a square root that is the distance of a hypotenuse if we do that it gives us one leg and the other leg upon which we can make some sort of a trigonometric function a relationship amongst those two sides tangent is the appropriate relationship here it's nice we don't want to do cotangent and be one overx that'd be silly I want to do tangent and get X over one that way I have a nice substit tion soal X Tan = x we plug that in for X so 1 + we still have square root DX is an issue we got to change that so just like you did on a u sub you still take a derivative So Tan th = x no no no let's do see s equal DX then we get okay cool integral of s < TK 1 + tan^ 2 what's what what's else squ what that's nice this part that is my DX so instead of DX I've got see squ Theta oh you know what I forgot my uh my D why don't you guys catch me on that we you sleeping my goodness do you all feel okay with that one so far look what it does as soon as you do this that changes into from 7.3 to 72 just what we did you just did stuff like this didn't you in fact this is this is even nicer because it already has an identity built right into it it's already going to match up that's why we pick one of three trigonometric substitutions we pick tangent we pick secant and we pick sign if you got those three the identity is already there it's really really nice you guys ready to do this thing so tell me what is 1 + tan 2 th okay we do need to know that one all right do we have a square root still yeah 1 + tan s is SEC s time SEC s D give me something nice that happens do what now squ yeah that's exactly right this has to happen so this is nice because we have one of these identities which you are going to have look at it's being squared right is squared so you're can to have a constant plus something squared you can factor that out you can make it work so that that with identity your square root gets rid of your Square that's fantastic we love that so this becomes see Theta time 2 D th what are you going to do now com probably combine oh goodness we've actually seen this one before in class do you remember we did this was the this was a horrible one uh actually no no was seeking to the fifth that was really horrible do you remember doing that one we split it off we used an identity we we did a whole bunch of stuff with it we ended up adding the integral back and dividing remember that so I'm not going to do that again this is already in the video if you want to refresh remember on your notes or something it's already back there I don't remember it was 71 or 72 I think 71 I think it was integration by parts is what we did so it's already back there but anyway this integral becomes was it 12 yeah I it yeah 12 sec Theta Tang thet plus Ln absolute value of plus Tang no reduction for form here it's a integration by parts if you really want to prove that that is the way it is you split off the secant squar you take the integral of secant squar it becomes tangent and then you do your integration by parts you guys okay with that one I'm not going to show it it's already on the video we've already done this one uh quick show hands be okay up to at least this point this one we've done before so I don't want to rehash it what I do want to say is okay let's take a look at my integral firstly for I don't know I think this is really cool do you guys see how interesting this actually is that we can do this this we're using a a triangle to do an integral it's it's crazy it's out there it's kind of fun um here's the problem what variable did I start with what variable do I have now that's a problem so you're not done right here don't just put a plus c and go I'm done you're not done but the rest of this is not that hard you see we've got this triangle that we created do you remember when you did a Uub when you did Uub you Ed the substitution to change a part of your integral correct then when you got done you substitute it back in remember that same thing happens here we used our triangle to do a substitution now we're going to use our triangle again to substitute back so if our triangle is the square T of 1 + x^2 and this is X and this is 1 here's what I want to know that's Thea here's what I want to know can you tell me all of these trigonometric relationships just put that anywhere fine uh can you use this triangle to tell me all these trigonometric relationships yeah yeah so let's list them out can you tell me what uh secant Theta is using you get now you got to be good at this you got to know that tangent is opposite over adjacent and S is opposite over hypotenuse and cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse and you have to know what coent and cosine and cose are so tell me what secant ISP very good because cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse therefore secant the reciprocal of cosine is reciprocal of this so what was it again hypotenuse over hypotenuse what's the hypotenuse over let's also do tangent so we're going to do all of our trigonometric functions right here just right by our triangle can you do tangent X OPP brilliant just opposite over adjacent we got X over one do your substitution it's not hard tell me what's going to be here for me please what's going to happen we got a one2 very good what else see what's secant okay then what are we going to have okay plus what changes over here does the 1/2 change no no no does the Ln change no does the absolute value change no what's inside not s x plus X well you don't know what and then 9 plus probably clean it up a little bit I would at least I would do yeah do 12 x you could factor out a 1/2 if you wanted to 1 + x^2 and then plus 12 Ln absolute value < TK 1 + x^2 + x + C oh my goodness let's check is it in terms of X like we wanted it yes so the idea kind of it's a crazy idea it's a cool idea it's use a triangle to make a substitution based on a trigonometric function do the integral like you know how to do it's just a trig integral you guys should know how to do this stuff and then at the very end when you're all done with it use your triangle again so triangle to make a substitution triangle to fix your substitution show hands if that one actually made sense to you do you guys get the idea did you even know that was possible kind of cool though right do you want some more examples of course you do yeah of course now this made it look a little bit easier than it might be for you because I skipped over this I skipped over the secant Cube uh we did that one before which you're fine to use that okay if you've done it before look at okay we've done that uh but you do know how you do know how to do that that is an integration by parts so some of these are going to take you some time do you guys have any questions because these problems take a little bit of of board work so I'm going have to rase this any questions at all before we go on you can ask if you want all right okay so before we go any further I want to give you a rundown about when we can use this and why the way why it looks the way that it does so we can use this when we have one of three situations I'm going to give you the formula again I don't want you to just blatantly memorize the formulas you will okay you will memorize them uh but I want you to understand why they are the way they are because it's really silly to do this stuff just by what's my formula it doesn't make any sense I want you to get why it works and that's important so this idea does work if we have one of these three things if we've got a square OT of a^2 - X2 or sare < TK of a^2 + x^2 or sare < TK of x^2 minus a 2 our first one was of this form now after we do that we'll be using one of our pythagorean identities so then we use either 1 + tan^ 2 = see squ in one way or another and or 1us sin s = cosine s say what oh darn it thank you so here's the big three I'm going to look at these in more detail we're going to understand why they are the way they are why the formulas actually work and then every time we go through one of these trig integrals trigonometric substitutions for integrals I'm going to rehash the same thing until it kind of sticks with you so here's number one let's look at this if we were to create a triangle out of this thing I always draw my triangles in the same orientation that way I have it fixed in my head I don't want to get random triangles up here it's got to be a right triangle of course I always draw it this way maybe you can do the same thing I want you to think of what this actually is it's going to be part of the Pythagorean theorem but think about the pieces up here would this have to be the length of the hypotenuse or the length of a side what do you think it's got to be a side because it's got a minus in there does that make sense pyan theem says the hypotenuse is when you take the sides and add them a side happens when you take the hypotenuse and subtract so what we know right now is that this is going to be the length of a side you guys all understand the idea it's got to be a side now think about which one of these would be the hypotenuse if this is a side one of these pieces has to be the hypotenuse what letter has to be the hypotenuse a has to be X can't be because the hypotenuse is the longest side correct so if this is the longest side x was the hypotenuse I'd get a negative inside my square root and I can't have that you with me so we look at this go wait a minute if this is a side one of these is a hypotenuse the bigger one the first one has to be the hypotenuse that's got to be a now here's your major idea idea for this whole thing for this whole lesson once you figure this out it's not hard I mean shoot if it's got a plus that is the hypotenuse if it's got a minus one of these is the hypotenuse is that clear for you it's the first one the bigger one is the hypotenuse now here's your whole goal your next goal is you are going to make these sides in such a way that you get X over a x a for either tangent or s or secant those are the only three that we're going to use tangent or sign or secant so we figure out where the hypotenuse is then what we do is we make our sides in a relationship so that tangent or s or secant gives us X over a is that clear for you I'm going to write that out and make a little little note here so notice that you get to choose right either this is going to be X or this is going to be X either this is going to be S root of x a square - X2 or this is going to be theun of a s - x^2 you get to choose but only one's the correct choice so put sides in a relationship such that we get X over a for tangent or s or secant these are the three that we use we don't use cosine we don't use cosecant we don't use cotangent we use tangent s or secant and the reason why we do that is because the identities are really nice for those it makes it easy you guys with me on that one so let's try so this is our idea yeah we want this let's give one of them a try if I do this if I put X here the only way I'm getting X over a is if I use what please you got to know your trig cosine would give me X is cosine tangent sign or secant then that's a bad choice so we figure out our hypotenuse first and then you only have two options X either goes here or X goes here or the side goes here or here if x goes here if x goes there can I make x a with either s or tangent or secant which one brilliant just fill up the the rest of the other side with whatever it is a^2 - x^2 that's the idea that's the idea so dep if you understand the idea you see most classes or most books just tells you hey if it looks like this we're going just do sinal x a that doesn't tell you why the reason why we're doing this is because when you create your triangle we're going to do it in such a way that this gives us something nicer something without a square root that's what we want something easy so if I've got a A for my hypotenuse I get my choice of X I'm going to choose it in such a way that tangent s or secant gives me X over a then we write that appropriate trigonometric function so which one are we going to use are you still with me so we go okay cool then s = x a sin = x a and we always solve for x we solve for x because that is going to be our substitution here you guys with me we don't have X over A's generally we have X's what you saying Thea I keep forgetting I'm so excited about doing this I keep forgetting my thetas uh so dorky to forget our forget your data I know it's ironic right but since I'm the teacher ha haa I get to Mark you down does it mean you're right it's true it doesn't that is true that's what I have you guys here for right to catch me on all this stuff so if we solve for x just multiply by a this right here becomes your substitution now you are going to get very good at this and what you're going to understand is that when you see something like this all you have to have is X = a sin thet you're going to have to draw your triangle every single time I still do it for myself especially because at the very end we're going to have to substitute back in so you're going to need that triangle so draw it get used to the idea of drawing your triangle don't skimp out on this stuff uh but this is where that's that's actually coming from you show F feel okay with that one good all right the next one number two let's talk about a^2 + x^2 now we actually already had an example of that one Michael uh so we just skipped the other trick functions because they're just difficult to use in this way you don't need them uh we use the ones that that that that work all the time uh those ones are the tangent the sign and the secant could you do it with the other ones probably um but we don't because these ones work these are the the big three this one takes care of tangent and cotangent this one takes care of s and cosine this one takes care of cosecant course so otherwise we'd have the different identities these ones work really nice you guys ready for the next one yep first thing we do every time we see one of these that we can't fit on our table that we can't do a substitution for that we can't do integration by parts for and that's not trigonometric we do a trig sub that means you're going to draw a triangle so so we draw our triangle here you've got to be very good at telling me whether this piece is a hypotenuse or a side what is that one hypoten very good so this makes it actually pretty easy our hypotenuse is a^2 + x s now we get to put our sides in a relationship we we are either going to have by the way what are our two sides here A and A good it's not a squ it's a so if this was a nine you'd be putting a three does that make sense sense okay so we have a and X where's the a going to go opposite or ajacent good because I'm trying to make I'm not trying to make S or see here because those have to deal with the hypotenuse I don't want that I want tangent tangent is going to be this relationship I don't want a overx that would be a bad idea what I want is X over a so in our case our substitution would be tan Thea = x a you okay with that one solve it for x x = a * Tang thet if you look back at the ex example which I I left on the board left part on the board when we did this when we did our substitution that was it X was 1 * Tang th that's what we had here then we squared that still okay with it let's talk about the last one then I'm going have to erace all this so if you have any questions you let me know but again I don't really care if you memorize these ones the way I'm hoping to teach you is that the relationship of a triangle actually should make sense okay it's then you don't have to memorize the formulas you can just do it whenever without having to look at it as a formula okay number three okay let's think through squ < TK of x^2 - A S would you say that X2 - A 2 is a hypotenuse or a side what do you think side it's got to be a side so it's either going to go here or it's going to go here I don't know yet until I determine where the hypot what the hypotenuse is so let's talk about what the hypotenuse is what's the hypotenuse how do you know it's X yeah if it wasn't if that was not a hypotenuse this would be bigger when I Square those numbers I'd get a negative and that's a problem so X is the hypotenuse now we got to put our sides which are a a is a side here x is already taken care of a is a side and this whole piece is also a side all right where's the a go in this triangle opposite okay let's try if I do opposite oh no sign would give us ax do I want that I want X over a and I can only use tangent s and secant so let's let's see which one of those work would tangent give me X over a Would S give me X over a okay so if that doesn't happen what's it going to be it's got to be secant and the only way to do secant is to move a from here to there is hypotenuse over adjacent so if I say hey the x is the hypotenuse guess what I'm using see hello that's the only way it works so X is hypotenuse I'm using secant does that make sense then this is x^2 - A 2 in this case we go okay well let's make our trigonometric substitution let's make something so that our trig function gives us x a the only one that works here is secant so see Theta is X a if we solve for x our substitution becomes x = [Music] a in each of these cases we've used a triangle we've created a trigonometric substitution after this we take a derivative of both sides that lets us change our DX into a d Theta DX d D DX into D Theta we do our substitutions and then we have a trigonometric integral which we just covered that section four get the idea kind of cool right what can't you forget at the very end of your integral to do use triangle yeah so we use a triangle to do this we're going to use a triangle to undo this as well it's time for some practice this is it this is the whole idea if you get this idea you're done all right it's practice it's not it's easy to made it sound all right uh right now it's like oh this piece of cake they do get a little tough um mostly it's just working with the trig and not the substitution you guys should be almost pros at that just after looking at this it's typically the trig integral that gets like oh man because you're going to be doing the last section stuff again lots of practice here you guys ready for some practice exciting little bit I'm so excited it I don't know it's fun for me will we be able to do the whole section knowing this will you able to do the the whole section just knowing this yeah is this pretty much like the bread and butter the whole thing this is trigonometric substitution about yeah sorry 73 this pretty much 73 pretty much it okay yeah which I think unless there's anything else that uh that happen yep that's it so we can do our homework yeah won't we just end right now then huh no examples whatsoever fantastic you know one more thing that I want to put up here for you that I didn't put up um if you're going to do this substitution you're going to be getting a s squared see it if you get a s squared then you're going to be using this one you follow me you're going to have something sorry something minus sin squ you'd be using this identity if you're going to have a tangent up there you're going to have something plus tangent you'd be using this one does that make sense so let me write this for you here so once we have this the substitution we would have is 1 -^ 2 thet = cosine 2et this would be the substitute the identity we'd be using once we have a 1 + tangent 2 th you'll be using 1 + tan^ 2 th = see squ this one if you have a look at this if you made the substitution you'd have see s minus something you have s- 1 we'd use SEC 2 - 1 = tangent and those would be the follow-up identities that you're going to use here now let's practice do you have any qu do you have this written down everybody yes no yes yes okay let's practice again I don't care if you memorize the formulas it's going to be obvious what you do if you me if you understand the idea so let's do some how about this one go through these integrals not just that we're in in a certain section for trigonometric substitution go through them and see if you can actually do them without it okay like if I give it to you on a test I'm not going to tell you what to do so go through it see if you can do it with a substitution if if you can cool do it see if you can do it integration by parts of it if it's really quick you go okay I can do that see if you can do it with a tri just basic trigonometry if it has signs and cosiness up there do it go to trigonometric substitution of course you can have something like this but try some of those things like if this was just X and that was just X I'd go for it I'd go for a substitution I would start a trig sub because it would be easier than that does that make sense okay in our case we have well nothing but a trig sub here what piece are we looking at to substitute yeah so let's take a closer look at the square root of 9 - x but you know what I'm not going to think about it as 9 - x^2 I'm going to think about it as almost begs the question wait a minute what if it wasn't nine what if it was seven could you still do it yeah you got to think outside the box though if this was a seven you could do something like the square < TK of s square that would give you seven does that make sense it's harder but generally we get those perfect squares which is really nice but you don't have to okay here's where the rubber meets the road all you basically all you have to do is know how to draw your triangle I mean not just a triangle but know how to put the sides on the triangle that's the key thing if you can do this correctly and make the appropriate substitution everything else falls into place really nicely so let's walk through it I don't want you to just look at your notes and memorize the formula I want you to think through this would you say that this is a side or a hypotenuse side it's a side for sure can you tell me what the hypotenuse is here so create a triangle that's three tell me what uh one other side is X now we want to put this in a relationship so that we get X over 3 with what three functions are we looking looking at I heard a lot at once hopefully you said s tangent and secant that's right s tangent secant let's see which one would work for us is is tangent going to put X over a for us no tangent would put whatever you're going to have a square root somewhere that's not good uh would secant work for us no secant could put X over sorry 3 overx but not X over3 I don't want to do that so what's the only other option for us sign let's make this work with s x would have to go there to work with s does that make sense to you the other side now we change it back to 9 < TK 9 - x^2 let's go for this let's do our substitution so the first thing we got to do is well all right once we have our triangle what's our relationship again one more time what do we [Music] have good so s of theta = x 3 that makes sense doesn't it sin of = x 3 opposite over hypotenuse therefore x = 3 sin th quick show hands if you're okay with that one cool now what else are we going to do right now that we've done our substitution yeah that's great idea so DX would equal 3 cosine [Music] so hey we got our substitution are you guys okay with this so far we've got x = 3 sin thet no problem take a derivative DX = 3 cosine D Theta now we get to substitute with all the stuff so let's see how it works out for this in this type of process everywhere you see X you're going to have to substitute there's going to be no elimination of x's because you're getting rid of all the X's with your thetas so tell me what's going to be on the numerator please we got to move a little little quicker here three what okay so three is the three going to get squared here yes yes it's part of your X so this whole thing get squared if you put three sin^2 thet you missed out on your constant you're going to miss that denominator n's still there very good what's 3 sin Theta and then what all squared very good I like it and then oh man we got a D Theta as well oh sorry DX as well what's the DX become okay honestly if I did this at the start of class you'd probably be like what in the crap is going on here uh but let's see if you it makes sense now are you guys okay with a triangle it's just a triangle you got to be okay with triangles they're fun make up the relationship such that this fits okay and that you get a trigonometric relationship you want s tangent secant where you get x a that's the whole deal once you get that everything else works out real nice so we got well most of the time we got DX = 3 cosine D Theta that's where this comes from we got x = 3 sin Theta s 9 cool- 3 sin th s now it's just a matter of simplifying don't try to work with it now simplify what's going on here so let's do it this becomes 9 * sin 2 Theta this becomes the sare < TK of 9 - 9 sin s Theta and this is still 3 cosine Theta D Theta we're just doing some algebra right [Music] now now here's the issue this is almost almost an identity but it's not why is it not an identity the nines are there well let's Factor the nines yeah let's factor that out so 9 sin squ th over Square < TK of 9 if we Factor those nines I get 1 oh beautiful look at that love math cool that's the same this we factor out the nines we got 1 - sin^2 th we got 3 cosine Theta D Theta still you guys still okay with it tell me what happens when I have a product within a square root what can I do with that pull yeah you can separate products within square root so let's see if we can do we've got 9 sin s we've got what's a square of 9 and then the square root of 1 - sin 2 and then we got up here a 3 cosine thet D threes are gone three here three here also check it 1 - sin s th this is why we did that substitution cuz this will work for us so 1 - sin what is 1 - sin sare that's why we use sign okay because that works nicely for us also what else is going to happen Okay so n is here I've got s Square th I have square < TK 1 minus oh sorry I messed up I've got cosine 2 time cosine thet D Theta we still okay so far it's getting nicer noce have we done any calcul this right now no no not really at all all we've done is manipulate it so we've got nine out front threes are gone this is cine s it's still in a square root tell me what happens with that square root [Music] so we have cosine th time cosine D Theta those are gone we have N9 integral of sin 2et D thet can we do the integral of 9 squ sorry 9 integral of s^ s how would you do it reduction you could do reduction formula you could how how could you do it if you didn't want to half angle yeah very good sorry I didn't hear you so if I did half angle we could do 12 1us cosine 2 th D Theta 12us 12 cosine 2 th D Theta stop me if you see a mistake I know I'm working kind of quickly here uh what else pull half out you could you P pull the 1/2 out then we're going to have 9 half if I factor the 1/2 out 1 - cosine 2et D thet don't just pull this one half out though you'd have to factor to make that happen why didn't do it on the earlier stuff you could have you totally could have don't know why I didn't oh you're about right there yeah you could have done it right here just pulled the one I see that right there can you take the integral of one what is that it's not x no keep in mind this is why it's importanta what's the integral of cosine 2 Theta good so Theta minus 12 sin 2 Theta are we still okay okay we're going a little long today I'm sorry for that um did you guys want to finish it right now un bet you do we have no class coming in so we're good wo let's go another hour okay no no no show we're not doing that I'm hungry I'm wasting away lost three pounds in a week I know I've been moving it's great this anyway it's not not important SOA I don't you feel sorry for me after to do math and I'm moving 12 sin 2 thet we still all right with that one M now here's the issue this is done calcul is done but we started with we have use your triangle you're always going to use your triangle so here we go let's start with it what do we know about this thing we know what sign is oh goodness gracious well we know that sin Theta let's start with this okay cuz you you can't have any thetas left you got to have all X's we know that sin thet = x 3 we know that don't we Okay cool so keep it keep it simple use this substitution again s this is why we write this one we don't go directly to this one because often times we'll have to use this sin th = x 3 if that's the case the only way we can solve this is say well let's take it a left inverse of sign on both sides if we if we do this sin th = x 3 if only if Thea = sin inverse x 3 that's one little piece here's the problem our our main problem our main problem is that sin 2 thet that's a problem if I look at sin 2 th is that 2 thet no no you don't just get to pull out a two or multiply something by two you actually have to have the actual Theta so when we look at S 2 we need to know that that is the same thing as 2 sin thet cosine Theta hey look at that do you recognize that identity sin 2 Theta yep is a double angle so sin 2 is the same thing as 2 sin now now it becomes easy can you do sin Theta yes we already know that one sin Theta is X over 3 Let's do cosine Theta let's look back at our triangle for cosine Theta how much is cosine so adjacent adjacent over hypotenuse you like our back there so good toy guys yes okay I'm gonna have to erase this we're g to move over here we're almost done I promise uh but I want to make sure that this actually makes sense to you are you okay with our triangle substitution for this that was pretty this the easiest part actually is this it's easy now that I've taught you how it actually makes sense you don't have to follow formula hopefully you understand hypotenuse sides put them in the right relationship get whatever trig substitution is necessary everything's simplification all of it is simplification until right here then we have a little bit of calculus you know how to do that already that's your last section we get all the way down here and then you go ah junk now we got to substitute back in for any thetas that we see some of them are easy some of them are are take some some time okay so check it out Theta whenever you have just a Theta you are going to have an inverse trig function so if sin th = X 3A is sin inverse of x 3 you got it sometimes you'll need an identity sin 2 thet no no can't have that get 2 sin Theta cosine Theta well sin Theta would be X 3 that's from more triangle s is X 3 cosine thet is 9 - x 3 and now we're going to put everything back together so 9 Hales we've got Theta - 12 sin 2 thet I'm going to draw it out to make it hopefully very clear for you you this is 9 - 12 * 2 sin thet cosine thet by the identity that we just used so the 1/2 is here this is 2 sin thet cosine thet understood 1/2 and two are gone so we get nine halves Theta is sin inverse x over3 minus s was x 3 cosine was < TK 9 - x^2 over three we'll make it just a little bit nicer looking here you could factor out um a a 1 nth but don't do it with this three because that's part of your Angle now you can't change that so oh not sorry not angle that's uh side relationship so 9 halfes we have S inverse X over 3 - x * < TK 9 - x^2 over 9 and then finally plus C oh my goodness yay is the triangle the hard part no it's all of this junk that hopefully afterwards I need to show fans you feel okay with what we've just done fantastic all right three more examples and we're done with Section 7.3 again we're going through some of these these integrals that we can't otherwise do without this thing called trigonometric substitution so the idea is look for a square root in your problem sometimes you will have to create a square root in your problem if you look for a square root in your problem that fits the Pythagorean theorem of a right triangle we can do the substitution so let's take a look at this one this one's not going to take us too long just want you see a couple other techniques that we're going to use here so integral from 1 to the3 of 1/ 1 + x^2 to 3 do we have a square root in this problem yeah might be a good idea to write it like that so instead of just like this just take a second and rewrite it so that we have that square root so instead of three halfes what does that three halves actually mean to the square okay so I'm going to have a square root like this and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to have that three outside you should know from your algebra that you can have the the power three inside or outside we're going to choose the outside that way our substitution is actually possible you guys okay with that so far now we should be to the point where you can make up your own triangle here so give me the idea let's walk through this one I'll have you do the next one on your own what's the idea what are we trying to do hypot so we want to find the leg okay so we want the legs and the hypotenuse let's look here we get the square root and what I'll do is I'll have uh square root of 1 plus + X2 that's going to give me something here so we're trying to make the < TK of 1 + x^2 be either one of the sides one of the legs or the hypotenuse now one thing I'll always do is I'll try to write whatever this number is as a square that way it gives me the side of one of the lengths of the the legs so instead of one I know it seems a little bit trivial but I'll put one squared if it was like four I'd put 2 squared 16 I'd put four squared that way I'm not accidentally putting the wrong number on one of my my legs does that make sense to y'all yes okay so let's think about it we got the < TK of 1^2 + x^2 you guys should know right now what that is whether that's a hypotenuse or the length of a leg what do you think that's going to be how do you know all the out of like sorry how do you know automatically what it is if it's got a plus there it's got to be the hypotenuse not because it's a formula but because we understand what the Pythagorean theorem does Pythagorean theorem says that the length of hypotenuse is one leg squared plus another leg squared and then you take a square root of it so there's no way that can be a leg this has to be the length of the hypotenuse does that make sense to you if we have a minus well that's the other case Pythagorean theorem says for the length of a leg we taking the hypotenuse squar minus another leg so what we know is if we had a minus right here this would give us the length of hypotenuse and this would give us the length of the other leg this would be the length of uh the the last leg itself so let's go through this how much sorry how much do you know about what Trigon trigonometric identity to make which three do we always use good those are only three because those are the identities that work well for this now what we're trying to get out of this is X over a constant X over a is what we say so we got to use either tangent or s or secant to make this happen in that case we're going to pick X for here and one for here so we look at the length of our sides we got X and we got one X and one where's the X going to go here option one option two option option two try put X here oh wait no option one if I put X well think about why though don't just fall into the pattern look at the formulas I hate that I don't want you to memorize all the formulas and okay CU what if you forget a formula that sucks if you understand the triangle it will make this easier let's look at this uh firstly do you all understand why this has to be the hypotenuse yes or no okay if that's the case either this is one and this is X or this is one and this is X if I have this is there any way in the world I'm going to want to use sign or secant on this triangle right now sign I'd have this I'm trying to get rid of that that that's the cool idea I don't want I don't want that how about uh how about seant I'd have this I don't I don't want to use that either I want to relate the easiest two sides the X and the constant but I want to do it in such a way that I get X over the number not the number over X so is this going to work for us no tangent would give us 1X but well let's make it nicer let's put X here and one here now if I take tan Theta I get X over 1 which means that X = tan Theta typically what we'll do is remove our constant over here since it's one no big deal okay keep on going what now we got xal tan Theta what's the next idea before we plug it in because we have two things that we're going to be doing here what else should we do say what you take the let's do that if we take the derivative you see when we do this we're going to be changing this into some sort of a function involving Theta but we also need to change our DX into some D Theta so in order to do that we take our derivative we get DX equals oh everybody tangent d d Theta perfect guys so far we so good go ahead and make the substitution let's see you guys do it Go From Here plug in what you need to plug in I'll do the same thing on the board I just want to make sure you can do it on your own okay so go I'll give you about 10 seconds and I'll put it on the board make your substitution notice when you're doing trigonometric substitution the square root it's never going to change the idea is that we're changing just this variable X because when we Square it when we square whatever that variable is of our substitution we're going to get some sort of One Plus or constant plus that we're going to be able to make an identity out of like 1 plus sin squ or one plus Tang squ or one one of those actually 1us s Square sorry or 1 plus Tang squ that automatically fits one of the identities that we have in hand so one does the one change no no and the plus doesn't change what's the X become s good so if the x is tangent then this is tangent Square thet very good and we still have that power three let's make sure we're not losing anything now the reason why we did our our derivative right here is so we also substitute for our DX what's our DX become let's make sure do we have all thetas and a d Theta looks like it we're pretty good to go there's one thing I haven't done yet and this is kind of up to you I like doing this uh some people don't some people like to wait till the very end I like changing bounds I like to because sometimes I'll forget to replug in my substitution that kind of sucks so right now I'm going to go ahead and change bounds we do that at this step we don't want to wait till later do it right now when you're doing your substitutions so right up here we'd have X = < TK 3 and 1 write that down so if that's the case if xals a < TK of 3 then what we would get is is tan th = < tk3 and tan th equals 1 please notice I'm doing this on purpose I want to make sure that you guys see how to actually change the bounds in this scenario if you have x = 3 look at where the x is X is Nota what we're trying to do is solve for Theta does that make sense to you so we'd have the S < TK of 3 equals tan Theta we would have 1 equals tan Theta you guys follow this idea well now what we're going to try to do is put our integral in terms of theta not tan Theta we don't want one and 3 here again what we're going to have to do is use an inverse tangent to figure out what that is so basically said okay cool I'm glad you got this now go one step further figure out how much Thea is so recall I'll do this on one of them have I lost you I don't want to lose you yet recall that this is true if and only if this is true do you remember doing that this is true if only if and only if this is true so basically it's asking hey um what angle does it take for tangent of that angle to equal one and same thing here what angle does it take for tangent of that angle to equal s of three do you guys know what it is or can you think of the the inverse what's tan inverse of the three what's tan inverse of of one and pi over 3 and four yeah it's it's a nice order for us too so this becomes pi over 4 this becomes pi over 3 let's make sure that you guys all have this um are you okay on writing this as a square root to the third power yes no you guys are dead today huh my goodness was Monday but geez more activity I'm I'm excited about this stuff you should be too goodness gracious to this is fun I guess come on people we talking about math Jedi already jeez okay so are you okay with writing that as a square root to the third power still wasn't any better was it lame people in the video think you guys are lame right right now right on anyway uh so this is now that hotus real we talked about why we're trying to make our sides in a relationship that work with Tangent or s or secant that give us X over constant we've done that with Tangent So Tan the = X no problem now if you have a definite integral change your bounds here if we change our bounds x = 3 okay tan theta = < 3 that's what we're getting that means that you're going to have to do tan inverse of 3 to figure out your angle in this case we get 3 in this case where tan = 1/ 4 tan of Pi 4 gives you one so we've changed our bounds from PI 4 to Pi 3 and still in order which is nice for us okay next step come on tell me what we're going to do the bottom from the bottom so we're going to use our identity get rid of that thing this is always going to happen if you do your trigonometric substitution appropriately you're going to have an identity that you'll use so we'll have pi over 3 Pi 4 to pi over 3 got SEC s th over tell me what this is going to be exactly what's still there okay square root is still going to be there I like that what else this this is an identity this is equal to see square and what else don't forget any little pieces here cool almost done what's the next thing that we're going to do quickly come on you you end up one over Square you squa to the second and then the square roots would cancel out you end up with one okay so let's simplify this part let's do that square root of something squared what happens so we got p 4 we got Pi 3 we got s we got the square root of SEC squ is just but then I have it to the thir power so this gives me secant Theta to the third power are you still okay so far notice all the simplifying you're doing really we haven't done any calculus this is a calculus idea sure trigonometric substitution but have we actually done any maybe a derivative here huh maybe a little bit that's pretty easy we're just really simplifying a lot of us to make it nicer for ourselves so Pi 4 Pi 3 we're going to have 1 over seea D Theta don't get hung up on this stuff think back to what I told you about trigonometric integrals how trigonometric integrals work is this if you have signs and cosiness I told you how to deal with those right yeah if you got tangents and secants I told you how to deal with those if you have cotangent and cosecant I told you how to deal with those if it's not one of those things try changing it into SS and cosin try changing that if it doesn't man what's one over secant well let's think about one over secant is cosine so pi over 4 to pi over 3 no problem this is just cosine Theta and all of a sudden we have a very very easy integral to do everybody what is the integral of cosine Theta what do you think perfect oh you got everyone now we woke up sin Theta now here's the question do I have to go back and change everything into X's again no this is why you'll want to change bounds here because if you don't you're going to have to use your triangle you have to go back and change this back into X's before you plug in 1 to the of 3 did you just catch what I said yes okay so if you change balance this is kind of nice here because you don't have to go back to your triangle if you didn't do this right now you'd be looking at sin Theta you would have X look at this please you'd have X over this 1 + x^2 then you plug in the squ of three and you plug in one and you subtract those two fractions does that make sense to you if we change balance no big deal we change these from X's into thetas hey it matches now so now these are in terms of theta no need to plug it back in we're just going to go Pi 4 to pi over 3 what that means is we'll have s ofun / 3us s ofun / 4 that should be pretty easy for us at this level s of piun 3 is what it's over two that's good isn't thegal of cos sign no it's not but think about why okay sare 3 over2 very good andare < tk2 over 2 make them one fraction 32 over two that's the idea took us a little bit longer than I thought but show hands if that move made sense for you good deal okay let's work on the next one so definite integrals you might definitely want to try to change your balance here that way you don't have to use your triangle to make your resubstitution just a good idea are you guys okay down to this far show fans if you are very good that's fantastic that's what I'm looking for let's do the next one questions comments concerns is it more understandable than the first time we went over yes it's getting easier is it getting easier for you I like definite integrals better these ones yes why there's no res substituting that's why that's why you change your balance well of course Rob now that you've said that I'm not going to give you any more different intervals we're going to practice these ones now right on you're welcome okay here's what I want to do I want you guys to try to do this problem basically completely on your own but we're going to do step by step so the first thing I want to do I want to see if you understand that that's going to be a trigonometric substitution can you see it just by looking at the problem we're looking for well substitution firstly substitution ain't going to work we're looking is it uh by Parts well not really we don't have a product that's going to work for us very nicely is it a trigonometric integral well not yet but we're going to make our substitution so I want you to pick the piece that's going to be the trigonometric substitution go ahead and do that now pick the piece that you're going to use it's always a square root always if there's no square root in the problem you need to make a square root in the problem you can do that algebraically so pick a piece of that that's going to be your substitution make a triangle from it make a triangle think about think about the piece that you you just picked is that the hypotenuse or is that a leg a leg leg okay so you have it as a leg pick the appropriate piece of this that's the hypot new first so label that out do it individually do it on your own let's see if we all get the right Tri do you guys know that making the triangle is like the most important Point part here after that once you translate it to a trigonometric integral it's it's pretty straightforward I taught you how to deal with it the triangle is important here I want to make sure y all got this it's a right triangle the piece you should have picked is X - I'm not going to write x^2 - 4 what I'm going to think of it as is x^2 - 2^ 2 okay now let's think about it did you find out that this is actually the length of one of our legs yes okay now how we start this we always start with the hypotenuse first always because then we can determine what our legs are after that so if this is a leg then one of these pieces is going to be my hypotenuse everybody what is my hypotenuse in this case good yeah it's it's always the one that comes first otherwise you have a negative inside of your radical that's not possible so X is our hypotenuse the reason why we write this as 2^2 rather than 4 is so that we don't accidentally put four here or four here we put two here or two there depend on which side that we need to use for this does that make sense to you okay now we'll think a little bit harder which trigonometric relationship would we want to use here would we want to use tangent at all no tangent is going to have a square root in it and that sucks I don't want that are we going to use sign no sign would have X in it but it' be something over the X this is the way you go through you actually think about these don't just follow the pattern think about what's going on here tangent sucks got a square root No Deal s sign's pretty close because we could make it constant overx but I don't want it overx I want X over something so the only other option that we have is so set up this triangle so that secant is going to work nicely for you where does a square root go bottom leg right leg that way we get it out of the secret relationship so the square root is x^2 - 4 I'll put the four back because I don't need to worry about that anymore and this one what's this going to be two two not four two do you understand why it's two this is why we do that let's make sure this works for us we have hypotenuse got it we have one leg here this is going to set up our secant relation ship and then we have this as another side show feel okay cool okay go do the next step if you haven't done it already write the trigonometric relationship we just talked about as equal to those two sides find your derivative and make your substitution I'll give you about 30 seconds to do that if you can do that fact okay which one works again yeah secant is going to give us hypotenuse over adjacent so secant Theta makes that relationship that we want we want X over some sort of constant uh then what we do after we get X over some constant solve for x yeah solve for x cuz that's going to be our substitution I don't see any X over 2s over here neither do you I see just X's so let's make this x = 2 Theta okay everybody what's the next thing that we're going to do take yeah because not only do we have to substitute for our X's we also need to substitute for our DX so by taking our derivative by the way just question here should you use a product rule here no it's a constant don't use don't make things harder than they are don't do something silly okay I know that a lot of people think that this is going to be a really really hard class and some parts it is but don't make it harder than it is if it's a constant you wouldn't do this what's the derivative of 2x product rule let's do it no that's silly right yeah it's a product but that's a constant in front it's a factor that's happens to be a constant so we do two and then what's this become oh that's good and then d Thea very good okay if you haven't done so already make your substitution have you all substitute on your integral not yes or no have you made it that far okay go go do that next do the substitution let's make sure that we're all 100% correct there's a lot of pieces here lots of stuff going on so make sure we're all right where you have X where you have x what are we putting in for X OH Close don't forget that too if you forget the constant there is your integral going to work out no it will but your constants are all going to be wrong so make sure your constants are correct if if it's 2 see Theta make sure that goes in every place for x and your DX make sure we have the correct thing for DX so let me make sure you get the same thing I'm about to get let me have your eyes on the board here real quick please so X S I still have a square root but x s no no no for X2 I'm going to have this whole thing squared notice it's not this do you see why not yeah when I have X this whole thing is the X so when I Square it it's got to be like that did you catch that yes that's going to affect this because what happens here is when you square the two it allows you something to factor out you can take that four out of there and that's what we want to do also to the 4th well it's now going to be 2 SEC theet all to 4th so we got 2 see Theta no problem we got it squared minus minus 4 4 got it we got a square root around it we got a 2 secant Theta now it's to the 4th power and lastly what else do I need up there so 2 SEC Theta Thea D Theta what I want to know is show up hands if you got exactly that on your paper I know you do now but like before I did it how many people got had that that's good that's great that's a first step if you didn't does it make sense how to get that are you sure it's going to take some practice right we got to get this stuff down what's the next thing that we should do should we start doing substitutions and all that stuff right now what we going do simp always simplify these things don't do substitutions or crazy stuff until you have this simplify so if we simplify well it's just a whole bunch of algebra I'm going to go through kind of quickly if you have questions of course let me know when we Square this this will be square < TK of 4^ 2us 4 all over 2 4th is 16 SEC SAR sorry sec to 4th Thea and then of course we still have a 2 see Theta Tang thet we can't afford to lose any of this stuff interal won't work out next thing what would you do if this was your problem on a test because it very well might be Factor the inside of the yeah what we know is that identities work with see squ minus 1 not SEC squ - 4 so when we have the same number here that's what we have to have that's that's important we got to have that so if you miss the two here you're going to miss the four here that's a problem so once we factor that four pull it out sure I'm going to actually do that step right now okay so watch carefully there four factors correct so what we get is a^ 2us 1 if I factor the four and take a square root it's going to give me two does that make sense this is this to me in my head is it to you in your head yes okay so see squ - 1 no problem the four is factored I take a square root because we can separate square roots like that with product 16 4 time you'll notice that when I'm doing this I'm not doing a whole lot of math in my head there's a few things but not a lot because I don't want to lose any constants that's the big deal not con no losing constants no losing negatives tell me some things I can do now pull one turn it into a 10 okay let's be careful about that that 1/ 18 oh yeah yeah it's going to be a44 oh yeah 2 * 2 is 4 4 16 is 1/4 so 2 this is 4 over 16 1/4 comes out integral of so this is 1/4 all the constants are gone that's what we want how much is see Square - 1 everybody come on how much is SEC Square - 1 obvious identity because that's what we were going for that's why we did our substition in the first place once we get hey look at that something s minus 1 this will become a one something squ minus one that's great we want secant because we know see squ minus 1 is tangent squ a square root of something squared goes away gives us just tangent this is the whole idea folks that's why we're using S and secant and tangent because those identities are so nice for us so we got uh let's see square root of tangent [Music] over SEC 4 * Theta tangent Theta D Theta are you all still okay you sure what's the next thing you do we're still simplifying how much does this become what now canc canel let's do that so this becomes to the third power that's gone so we'll have the 1/4 is still there yep tan squ over see to the thira D what I want to know on a show of hands if you can make it down to that far on your own does the triangle make sense to you is it starting to make a lot of sense can you do that this is the idea here folks this is trigonometric substitution that's all it is after you do this and you simplify it that is your last section now this is kind of cool because we can do all of these problems you won't be facing anything that you haven't at least seen before somewhere I've given you some pretty tricky ones in this class so nothing should be above you okay nothing's Beyond you at this point now just follow the pattern this does have tangents and secants like I told you about but are they being multiplied no okay so it's not sign and cosines it's not secant tangent how we like it it's not cotangent cosecant if that's the case then what are we doing with it we're changing it to signs and cosin so we're going to be changing this to signs and cosines if we can does that make sense if it doesn't fit change it to signs and cosin and see what you get right now there's no way I'm doing that that integral I'm looking have no idea there's no way but if I change it signs and cosiness and simplify it after that maybe we got something so let's try so instead of 1/4 integral of this bunch of crap we're going to have 1/4 this should be I'll do this in two steps this is tangent s time cine 3 D you're all should be okay that 1/ SEC Cub is the same thing as cosine Cub yes no yes keep going I don't know anything that deals with Tangent and cosine to you was that in your trigonometric sub integrals from last section no we didn't have tangent cosine we had SS and cosin but if we do this if we know the tent is sin s over cosine s you okay with that one yeah do you see how changing things in the signs and cosiness can really help you sometimes otherwise you man you get stuck what am I going to do here substitution ain't going to work try changing it signs and cos signs once you do that maybe you get lucky and get something that that you can really work with here this is really nice those are gone all but one of those is gone we have integral sorry forget the 1/4 1/4 integral of sin^2 cosine th now take a look at it what would you do if you were doing this problem I would do you sub for sure just so remember listen this is a perfect example of go through the patterns that I taught you do not immediately jump to one technique or another honestly go through the easiest thing you can do in integrals is it well firstly it fits the table so we check it does this fit an integration table no it doesn't can you do a substitution yes yeah then for heaven's sakes don't start doing uh identities and stuff if you can do a simple substitution does that make sense to you so what I'm trying to get you to do is really think through these don't jump to a certain section because we're in it really think it through we start here we go hey can we do it like it is no can we do a substitution no is it trigonometric no integration by Parts no trig sub yeah do a trig sub simplify it down to whatever your trigonometric functions are after that does it fit a substitution no does it fit any of the trig models that we have no change it size and cosign can you do a substitution notice how I'm always going back to can I do a substitution are you listening we're always doing that always checking for the easiest not the hardest things to do do your substitution go for it aren't you glad we did a substitution didn't use an identity or something that would have been silly right if we use an identity we'd have 1us cosine squ wouldn't we then you distribute you have cosine that's that's don't do that what we want to have is s with one one power of cosine off to the side if we have that already this is the whole idea from the beginning right make a substitution substitute for sign cosine th D Theta is right there so we know this is going to be 1 14 integral of this piece is our DU so this is going to be what was it how much easier can we get just don't forget about the 1/4 just follow us all the way down this would be 13 U to the 3 still okay so far okay now are we done almost done almost simplify okay we're going to simplify sure we're going get 112 do we keep the U what's the U become okay we're going to have a couple things to do here so this becomes 112 s Cub th very good sin Cub Theta now we've already substituted once because we had one substitution here we're done with with that we got it back in terms of theta look back at our integral did we start with thetas x's so now that you have sin Theta can you make that back to X's where are you looking right now triangle use your triangle everyone should be able to do this go ahead and do it right now make sin Theta equal to something and then use that substitution so I want something right here and then I want you to substitute we don't need that big what relationship is sign whatever what do you have an opposite yes do you have a hypotenuse notice this based on that Theta this is exactly what we're talking about here so we hopefully you should have the < TK of x^2 - 4 over X did you all get that one how people did get that one that's great that's almost everybody that's fantastic so one last little step that we have we've got a 112th we've got a sign to the 3 so basically all this stuff is being raised to the third power so we get a 112 we get aunk x^2 - 4 to the 3 and we get an x to the 3 are you guys okay that both these are going to be raised to thir power It's s to the 3 so this is sin Theta to the 3 both numerator denominator ra to thir power if you want to make it just a little bit nicer is really kind of up to you um I might choose to write this as this because that's how we were given do you see that how we were oh sorry that was a previous problem my bad um whatever you want you can leave it like this you can write it like this I really don't care see so I know I'm done I never stop an integral until I either have the number if it's definite or I have a plus c I need to show pans if that made sense to you guys good deal all right fantastic question any questions we're going to start our last problem of the section we're going to get through the first little piece of it and then I'm going to ask you to do most of it on your own think you can do it on your own so we're going to do the first part though cuz the first part is a little tricky and I want to make sure you see this at least once last chance for any questions at all like days now I don't know just for simplification purposes before you erase it uh that that one right there under the triangle can you turn that into like a two square and then got rid of the Ral B let's down one more down one more step that step right there to get ready the radical can you turn that into a two squ this one yeah you can turn that into a two squar but there's no way that's going to simplify that square root no don't make up your own math it's never a good idea unless you're Isaac Newton who invented this are you Isaac Newton I'm notti no I'm Valentine making my own math awesome he's Cupid it's C back to the work okay I think we can agree that looks nastier than some of the other things that we have done so far so first things to do first thing I know it's fun right first things to do uh go through your whole process does that fit the integration table heck no no not even close uh can you do a substitution no do you understand that every time I see an integral and I've been doing this for years that's what I do I'm not just fing you down a rabbit hole this is literally what I do so I'm trying to tell you this is the best way to do it um I don't think I've got an integral wrong in a really long time really long time but this is what I I always stick with that pattern I think doesn't fit the table if not okay go to substitution if not all right integration by parts that's not going to work here I don't have a product all right if that doesn't work uh or I don't have anything to work with an Ln here uh that doesn't work does it have trig in there well no not yet can I fit it to something that has trig in there maybe maybe does it have a square root that's a good indication I might be able to do that so I'm going to write this just for my own mental well-being as a square root to the fifth power don't forget that fifth power now here's the issue this part sucks cuz that part right now does not look like a right triangle does that make sense to you it's not something squared plus or minus something squar and that's what we need for a right triangle for Pythagorean theorem so the idea is if this listen carefully please is the whole whether you're going to get this right or wrong if if this does not fit something squar minus something squared you make it fit something squar minus something squ or plus something squ so we have let's take this off to the side here little asteris 3 - 2x - x^2 take a look a little bit more closely at that one you ever heard of completing the square yes we're going to complete the square we're going to make this thing be a perfect square so how in the world are we going to do that well uh first thing you might want to do is have this thing in order because that's how completing the square works so we'd probably write this as x^2 - 2x + three you with me on that one by the way these are special cases these this is not going to be true for all the ones that look like this at all these are special cases that you can actually complete the square and it'll work so not all of them you can do this universally giving you special ones here does that make sense to you okay so put this one we're going to see it as well next thing you do you make sure that first term is positive that's got to be the case so what I'm going to do is I'm going to factor out this negative here I'm going to have x^2 + 2x I'm going to leave some space here I'm going to leave that + three you'll see y it's complet the square you guys okay with that one so notice this isx2 this is - 2x but the plus three I'm leaving that alone you follow now how you complete the square you have your first term positive you don't worry about this right now you look just in here we take the middle number the middle coefficient which is your b a A plus b sorry ax S Plus BX plus C take half of it Square add it now whatever you do here you have to also undo it otherwise you're changing the value of this thing does that make sense but watch Real Care First are you guys all okay with where the one came from that's kind of a big deal it's complet in the Square so we go hey take half of this number and square it add it over here now you have to undo what we just did I know it says plus one but watch carefully we really see how the negatives can distribute we we really subtracted one to undo that we're going to add one so are we adding one twice no we're not we're adding one here because really when you distribute you subtracted one notice how this going to be a minus one - one plus one gives you zero these black letters should be gone if you were to distribute this so if if you want to check your work if you distribute this and combine like terms do you understand that it's going to give you this back again it's going to be the same thing what we've just done right here is we've completed the square so this becomes x + 1 squar this becomes plus 4 you guys all right with that one completing the square if you do this you automatically have a perfect square uh trinomial it factors negative we kept that up front this is x +1 2 this is plus 4 show hands feel okay with that one write it in the appropriate order we want something squared minus or plus something else squared this doesn't cut it right now for that negative so I'm going to rewrite this as 4 - x + 1 squared now working back to our asteris we got a one we got a square root we got a nasty fifth power we got a DX in there watch careful first are you guys okay with completing the square idea look at what happens to us when we plug this back in we've got 4 - x + 1 squared do we have something squared plus or minus something else squared yes do notice why it's a special case because if this was like a five it'd be kind of difficult to do you could still do it all right could but it'd be a little bit harder um I think You' do it I remember now pretty sure but this is nice for us this will be really good here's the next idea I'll give it to you right now because I want you doing this on your own at home okay this is this is for you to do you need this completed by the time you come back to class CU I'm going to rip through this thing next time in about 5 minutes do a substitution right now get rid of the X+ one so if you did u = x +1 du = DX this just becomes a u so we get 1 4 - u^ 2 under < TK to the 5th power du U is this so 4 - u^ 2 5th power fth power square root square root DX becomes du show hands if you can follow that one could you do could you have done that on your own probably not before this can you do it now of course you can can you please finish that up for me this is not going to be super super difficult I think if you can all do that uh can you make a triangle with this yes okay so of course don't forget to substitute back in for you at the very end we work on this next time all right so let's finish up our problem um as you know what we're trying to do is we're trying to fit part of our integral into a triangle to use a trigonometric substitution on either tangent or s or secant because we have some nice identities with those so we're working on our problem now and right off the bat we understand it's got a square root but it's not something nice what something nice is a number or a variable squared plus or minus another number or variable squared we want something squared plus or minus something squared that's the idea if we don't have that immediately don't give up on it you might still be able to work with it so square root is the first indication that I might be using a trig sub here but substitution wouldn't work of course nothing else will works so we're down to just a trig sub square root says yeah you know what you might want to give this a try with a with trig sub but we got to change it a little bit so whenever you have a case where man it's not obvious what this is going to be take it up to the side see if completing the square is going to work so that's what we did here we organized it we factored out the negative we added half of this number squared notice that when we add it here it's really like subtracting it so I undo that so I know it's both plus one plus one but because of that negative this is really like a minus one so I do it with that plus one we organize it again we have a quantity minus a quantity here we have two squ minus something else squar this is our our first little manipulation are you guys okay with that first step it's just completing the square I know that many of you haven't done that in a long time but that's what it is maybe a review about completing the square on how to do that now at this point we could go straight to our triangle if we wanted but to make things easy to make it nice for me what I'm going to do is just a very basic substitution I want to get rid of that x + one you guys follow that way yeah I don't have to look at X+ one I'm going to look at a u instead so whenever this is the case when you get something squared you don't really want to deal with it right then feel free to do a substitution so off to the side I'll do u = x +1 this is really easy because du is just equal to DX I mean it's a straight sub it's nice if you're getting like uh after your derivative here something in terms of X yeah don't do that just the constant is what we're trying to get out of that does that make sense to you so here we go all right cool well we got an integral then we got one we still got this bracket with the square root we got a four still but here we're just going to do minus u^2 to the 5th and then du straight substitution for DX now this looks a little bit more manageable so right now what do we do yeah we're going to do that triangle it's a square root it has something squar minus something squar that's fantastic so right here I'm going to take my square root I'm not going to think about it as four I'm going to think about it as yeah that gives me the length of a side or a hypotenuse or I'm sorry a leg or a hypotenuse depending on what we're given and which order we're given and I'm going to draw my right triangle from this what I definitely don't want to do is leave that a four and mistakenly put four here or here or here then my integrals will be all screwed up I'm not going to get this thing right so I really want to make sure that we understand that this number is the length of a hypotenuse or the length of a side a leg uh square is what that is so right triangle always drawn in the same orientation that we always have thing right uh by the way what is this thing is this whole thing the length of a leg or the length of hypotenuse yeah how do you know yeah the minus right there this says what this is which one of these pieces is the hypotenuse then the two the two not the four but the two so the two is the hypotenuse the first one is the bigger one otherwise we'd get something negative inside of the square root we can't have that so if the two is the hypotenuse the only way this comes about is if I take the hypotenuse squ minus another leg squar and took a square root of it that says this piece is one of the legs now we just have to be really good about fitting the the the legs in the right place we want a trigonometric substitution that works it's got to be S or tangent or secant so uh which one's going to work for us would tangent be a good choice no heck no I want to deal with the two at someplace right so it's either going to be sign or it's going to be secant however I want the two to be on the denominator I want the constant on the the denominator whatever fraction I'm going to create here whatever relationship so it's going to be sign which means X goes opposite or X goes adjacent make it so this stuff works for you don't make it it is me yes I know for away it's not me it's you anyway and we have theare < TK of 4 - U ^2 that's right I did the substitution so I have U now two feel okay with that one so we go hey hypotenuse uh no problems two this stands for a leg just put it in the right spot so that we get U over a constant for whatever trig sub we're going to do right now what's the appropriate one again yeah s is going to give us U over 2 s Theta so sin Theta = u 2 and then we're going to do what solve for U okay so u = 2 sin th and Next Step what is that sure because we're going to do a couple things here we're going to substitute for our U we're also going to substitute for our DU make hopefully we're all okay with the derivative of 2 sin Theta being 2 cosine Theta no product rule nothing like that now we get to put this back into our integral and make it a lot nicer look well not nicer looking but easier for us ultimately it's going to look nasty at first you oh my gosh there stuff everywhere but it'll all simplify for the most part so we got a one what's going to be inside of our square root right now can you tell me please 4- 2 sin 2 and if you do two sin Theta s that should all be in parentheses and then this whole thing is raised to the fifth power and then finally I do got to remember about my du some of you guys are forgetting some of this I can't have you forget this du has to be substituted for so instead of du instead of du we're going to put two perfect okay let's make sure we got this one stays four stays minus stays you no no no no U is 2 sin Theta we got it we have it squared we have 2 The 5ifth Power du no no no not du 2 cosine Theta D Theta D theta's got to match everything we had we can't have two different variables up there otherwise that doesn't work for us so far so good now what do we do yeah we're going to simplify as much as we can we don't start any sort of substitution right now that'd be crazy right I mean that how we going to do that what we do want to do is well simplify it as much as we can change it into an integral that we know how to do so one over if we do this this is going to happen a lot for you where you have four minus the same number whatever number is and then sin power are you still okay okay awesome what now out we're going to do the four we got to have this as one minus something for for this otherwise you know we got 4 4 - 4 sin s thet isn't an identity 1 - sin thet is so we're going to factor that if we factor out the four just be careful with your algebra don't do all of this stuff in your head give yourself some time to really think about it I don't want you just pulling out a two and have one2 you really need to see that what's going on here is well we're pulling out the four yeah the square root of four is two so we'd factor out the four and take a square root it's two we still have a square root of 1 -^ 2 are we all okay with that one factor the four we can separate square roots by product square of four is two no problem it's outside the square root this is inside the square root but it's still being all raised to the fifth power so don't do something silly right now and cross out this two with this two order operation says you do exponents before you start simplifying things like that well what that means is then we got an integral we got two cosine Theta oh do that all we got two cosine thet what's that two going to become 32 yeah because it's is 2 5th power so we got 32 and then we got 1 - sin 2 Theta yeah 2 the 5th D we're going to do a couple steps right now what's the first thing we're going to do yeah 116th goes up front di identity so this is 116th we got it we got a cosine Theta this is why we did that substitution for sign because we knew it was going to be 1 minus something squared well that something squar has got to be sign for this to work for us so 1 -^ 2 well it gives us the square root and that's all raised to the 5th power uh notice how I'm writing lots of steps I'm not trying to do everything in my head right now I know you guys are I Know It uh but I don't want you doing everything in your head cuz what if you forget a little constant is that going to be a good thing it's a bad thing if you forget a little square or fifth power that's a bad thing I don't want that to happen square root of something squared uh itself awesome so I'm going to have 116 integral of cosine Theta let's do this at once okay this gives you cosine thet 116 1 cosine 4A D Theta now before you start working with this integral the way it is 1/ cosine to the 4th it's probably a good idea to check if it fits one of our integration models first which means that when I'm looking at that I'm not thinking one over cosine cuz I don't know what to do with one over something do I I know what to do if this was cosine of the 4 that'd be great I'd split it up that's cosine 2^ s i' do 12 * 1 + cosine 2 thet squ i' distribute i' do that again but it's not that it's 1 over cosine 4th so let's change that into a trig function that we know how to do it so 116 integral of yeah let's talk about this asant to 4 Theta D Theta and fortunately for us we know what to do when we have seant to the fourth power when secant is even think back to uh to your tra seven to your last section what do you do when see is even break it up to a squ that's right so we're going to take a sec squ out there so 116 2 * s Theta D Theta the reason why we do that is because we're trying to get a tangent uh if we get a tangent by some sort of a Pythagorean identity here then derivative of tangent is secant squ so reason why we break off the secant Square it's CU we're looking for a tangent from the rest that's why we did that with even powers of secant because with even Powers we can strip off the secant squ it's still even we'll be able to get an identity of one plus tangent squ somewhere in there if I'm if I'm right hopefully identity now I'm going to have to erase part of this do you have any questions on this before we we continue so you got all this written down right this was basically just an algebra completing the square and then doing one basic substitution one thing I do want to remember is this okay I'm going to leave this on the board because this just kind of big for us at the very end and I'm I'm sure going to leave this on the board so 116th no problem integral uh looks like we're going to have uh what do I change that secant squ into what's that going to be plus or 1 + T theet whatever you want to write that as it time a see s Theta D Theta look how every what this does it changes it back into some sort of a trig model that we know how to deal with that's what our trig sub does change something we can we know how to do it's it's that's what substitutions always do change it into something we know how to do yeah now it's it's kind of basic after this we know a u sub for Tan Theta we've already dealt with this stuff du = 2 th D Theta that's right here that's exactly what we want that's why this step worked oh what I forget so we can no nothing think I just wondering if we can oh you know what yeah we have a u you might want to change it to a different variable so uh I already used a u so that's a good point forgot about that one let's make this into like a w just so we don't get because we will be res substituting back in for you and I don't want any confusion there so good point thanks for catching that I saw the look on your faces and wait a minute wait Mr Lanford you got yeah I made a mistake I mean I was testing you you passed making sure we were awake that's right I'm making sure you're awake that's the ageold excuse for mistakes from Math teachers so integral uh tell me what's inside my integral right now please what is it not U w^ 2 + 1 D good this whole thing is D DW whole thing is DW integrate yeah let's do it let integration can you all do that yes so when we integrate here we've got okay that looks pretty painless but we have some things that we're going to do we've done two substitutions here so first thing we're going to do we had W's here we started with some thetas originally we started with exit so we're going to have to translate this back twice now first I want to make sure you're all okay with this so far show hands if you are at after this point it's pretty easy I me it's stuff you know how to do so just do it like we've been doing okay so we're going to have 116th we'll have 13 well what's that W become so sure 10 Cub plus how much we still okay you got to put your X's back in okay so we are gonna we are gonna put X's back in but it's kind of weird we've done three substitutions uh we substitute first with a u then we made U's into thetas we made thetas into W's so now we've got our our W's we got back into thetas we're going to use this to translate our thetas back into U's then we use this to translate our use back into xes does that make sense to you all right so as long as you have your breadcrumbs to come back with you'll be fine all right just don't forget this stuff uh we don't want to get too involved in this to forget what we actually started with so with here we got 116 going back up top 116 we got 1/3 we oh let's think about tangent can you figure out what tangent is tangent Theta is that's why we leave our triangle here this is So Tan is over cubed the whole thing plus can you do tan Theta same same thing but not you know I'm going change that to a parentheses just so it looks a little bit better by the way is it the 1/3 that's also getting cubed or not no okay that wasn't inside there it's just the tangent so tangent of theta hey look at that tangent of theta is U over this guy of 4us u s no problem we got it to the Third Power Plus another tangent same idea opposite over ja it's right there are we done no one more thing to do now at this point if you are going to choose to simplify this this is where you would do it okay you try to make one fraction out of this right now instead of plugging in X's first all right so we get all the way down to as simple as we can with 's then we plug in the X's does that make sense to you so if you choose to do that so this this may or may not look like what it is in the back of your book it might look different they might find a common denominator here it wouldn't be super hard to do you'd multiply this by uh three and another uh 4 - ^2 factor and you can find a common denominator get one fraction out of it and then you plug in your X's you follow that's the idea now uh for the sake of time I'm not going to do that I usually do on this problem to show you how insane it gets with your algebra but I'm not going to uh that's going to be on on you what I'm going to do is do one more thing what am I going to do us we still keeping the 16 outside you can distribute it you can keep it outside I'm going to keep it outside just for the sake of seeing where everything's coming from okay um again if you were to simplify this you would do it here before doing what I'm doing right now because otherwise you have a lot of different Factor not factors there a lot of different terms of X plus one you're changing every U into two terms that gets kind of crazy so we'd have an x + 1 we'd have 4 - x + 1 squared and then that's under a square root and this whole thing is raised to the thir power then we'd have another x + 1 we'd have 4 minus x + 1 2 that's too small and that's what we would deal withy blessy let me know I'm that did you get it yeah yeah could you follow it yes do you want to simplify this one and see what you get no sir you sure we can do it if you really want to do you know how to yes no for some of you sadly that's true oh oh good how makes me want to right now go for it go for it yeah of course you say no I know and then I just completely said I'm going to anyway forget you guys let's see if I were to do this uh here's how I would do it I would think of this as U cubed over 3 < TK 4 - u^2 to 3r I would multiply this by three and 4 - u^2 squar I'm both the numerator denominator that would change it to a third if you simplify you can see that I'm right this would cross out all but one of those this would cross out you'd have just the U so this is this is the same after that you do a little bit of simplification we'd get 116th we get U to the 3 you'd get three bunch of junk 2 the 3 this right here square and square root have gone we get + 3 U * 4 - u^ 2 are you still with me you catch me if I've made a mistake sometimes this happens it happened to be once ear today after that 116 we'd have a u Cub + 12 u - 3 U 3r over 3 < TK 4 - u^2 to the 3 after that combine your like terms if you can I got a 116th doesn't really matter how you do this but I'm going to have a 12 uus 2 U 3r over same stuff that's as simple as we can make it right there uh the only not as simple we could factor out a two if we really wanted to that might be a good idea so factor out of two then what we would get is 1/8 6 u - 2 U 3 say what wrote it right wrong what' I say well obviously it's the camera was in the way I didn't see you told us to catch a mistakes you did yeah okay that's as simple as we can make it well not really we can factor out the three too EAS one over 24 let's just do that here okay we'll get rid of this three we'll make that a 24 are we still okay so far I hope is all my algebra right I certainly hope it is let's see not yet do the thank you  at this point when you've had it simplified here's what you plug in X+ one so 6 x + 1 because you is x + 1 - x + 1 3 power all over 4 - x + 1 2 sare < TK 2 the 3r we can get rid of the square root on the bottom we can't no we can't we have we still have the square root uh what I'm going to I'm going to leave this I'm I'm going to leave this as three half power I am going to simplify this one because I want to show you that what you're going to get back is exactly what we started with uh 3 - 3 - 2x + x^2 or - x^ 2 it's going to be the same so if I do this this would be 124 we got a 6 x + 6 minus if you're going to distribute that it's X Cub + 3x + sorry 3x2 + 3x + 1 but that's inside parentheses there we got Square < TK of 4 - x^2 + 2x + 1 in parentheses 2 3 moving on distribute your negative and then we'll combine some like terms almost done so let's see here we've got a five we've got plus 3x we've got a - 3x2 and a - x Cub can you double check my combine like terms for me please yes no now it's thank goodness so uh this is a test that so I want this all right no all right I just want you want you to see what potentially you can get out of this thing uh we stopped right here you need to see that this and this are equivalent by algebra they're the same thing so can your answer look a little different but be the same yeah yeah this is simplified don't actually it's not you can actually factor out an X plus one here so if you factored that out then it would be then it would be simplified but that's the idea she feel okay with the idea all right take a deep breath we're do twak sub for like 10 minutes well here's the point you now have a whole bunch of integration techniques right yeah we know substitution we know integration by parts we know how to do trigonometric integrals we know how to do a trig sub all those play of oh we know um we know integrals of inverse trick functions right hyperbolic and all that stuff all those things play a part in the following sections all of them we're going to use all of them that's why we did integration techniques so that when I give you an integral you can do it there's only one more integration I think one more one more integration te technique that I'm going to teach you it's this this next section 7.4 it's much more algebraic than the stuff we've been doing there's not a whole lot of Tri trigonometry in unless you have to use a trig Seer part of it you got me and that will rarely happen because what we're going to deal with in this case are rational functions integrals of rational functions any questions at all before we continue you sure this made perfect sense to you perfect sense perfect sense up to here i' love to take a picture and show 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 7.4:  Integration By Partial Fractions
get focused refocused on this we're going to do 7.4 so here we go the question on Section 7.4 that puts this question on your mind is how in the world or can we not where in the world how in the world or if in the world this is possible magic one you what I don't want it to be possible let's just stop let's just not do it uh and the idea is yes this is possible uh we can do integrals like this if we can do a couple things with them and I I'll talk about those couple things right now the section is entitled partial fractions and the name implies fractions now we're going to take this fraction and we're going to break it into parts and we're going to do integrals of now how we break up this fraction into Parts is very specific it depends on the number of cases uh the reason why this is possible is there's there's two rules in algebra with rational functions that you need to know so here's um here's how we'll call this the how how is based on two rules from algebra rule number one every polom in the world pols have U positive Powers they do not have square roots they have positive whole number Powers they're not like X to the3 they're not x to the 1/2 pols are things like this and things like this those are pols if you don't remember what those are those are pols every polinomial in the world can be factored as a product of linear and or irreducible quadratic factors that's a that's a law in well not a law that's a a a theorem approved theorem in algebra so every polinomial can be decomposed uh decomposed means broken up in different parts can be decomposed or can be factored into a product of linear and or irreducible quadratic irreducible quadratic vectors basically here's what this says if it's linear linear and or irreducible quadratics it means this ax + B and or ax^2 + BX + C every polom in the world can be factored as stuff that looks like this and or stuff that looks like this there are some quadratics that you can't Factor we know this correct hopefully we know this some quadratics have complex factors complex Roots which means you can't Factor them with rationals or whole numbers you can't do it but we can definitely reduce them into either linear and or quadratics this is our idea right now does that make sense so when we look at this you go hey look at that I don't know if I can factor that one don't really care but I can definitely definitely Factor this one it's a power three does that make sense I can factor that it's going to be linear and or quadratic factors problem number two or sorry rule number two rule number two is that every rational every rational function so basically where you have R ofx over Q ofx where R and X are both pols so for every rational where the degree of R is less than the degree of Q can be decomposed into partial fractions now there's one I I know I'm giving you a lot of theory right now and not a lot of practice don't worry we're going to get a lot of practice on this stuff um I want to give you one last little bit here look up here let's make sure that we understand a couple of these Concepts okay first first concept this is polinomial this is polinomial hence this is a rational are we all okay on the terminology the degree of this polinomial is two it's it's the largest power the degree of this polinomial is good if the degree of R ofx the top the main the numerator here if the degree here is less than the degree here you can decompose this into partial fractions so far so good mhm if the degree here is greater than or equal to the degree here then you do long division of pols first and what that does is that reduces the degree of the numerator to something that is less than this degree does that make sense so if the degree here is less than this you're good if the degree here is more than or equal to this you do long division first and then it reduces the degree of your numerator and then you do partial fractions those problems are kind of stinky we'll see those a little bit so little note no there's not a shortcut for degree r ofx syntheis no shortcut not synthetic division sure if it works if it satisfies the conditions but that is long division just quicker no I just quicker for degree RX greater than or equal to degree QX do long division first are you ready for the next little bit I know there's a lot of writing right now we're going to get to this example I promise but are you okay with this so far you kind of have to be okay these are two theorems that are are proved in mathematics every polinomial can be factored into a product of linear and or irreducible quadratic factors that's these and or these every rational where the degree of r is less than the degree of Q the numerator is less than the degree of the of the denominator you can reduce that into partial fractions if you don't have that you do long division which brings your power down your your degree down then you do partial fractions that's the whole deal there are several cases that we're going to discover happen with these type of fractions uh the first case is by far the easiest case and we'll talk about the easiest one first and we'll gradually make it a little bit more difficult and see what happens here so here's case one okay case one case one is where we have distinct linear factors distinct means unique it means you don't have multiple of the same factors otherwise you'd have that linear Factor squared does that make sense so distinct would be like you have x + 1 * x -1 * X +4 what you don't get you don't get x + 1 * x + 1 * x - 4 that would be non-distinct then you'd have x + 1 s we call that repeated linear factors are you all seeing the difference here so distinct means doesn't happen again happens one factor and then you have a different Factor so distinct linear factors distinct linear factors here's what we do in that case if we have distinct linear factors then what we can do is we can write r r x over Q ofx equals we break this up and we write a over ax A1 X Plus B1 and then we have another one b b over a 2x + B2 and we do this for every different linear Factor that we have notice this is linear you guys with me it's not quadratic doesn't have a power two this is linear this is linear so basically what we do is we Factor our denominator we see what factors we have if they're all distinct linear factors what we do is we make up a fraction for every single one of those distinct linear factors I know this might be new for you but are you okay with the idea here are you sure so we've got polom we Factor the denominator we look look at what type of factors we have if they're all distinct linear we write a fraction for every single one of those distinct linear factors until we get to the very last one that we put whatever we have um oh you know what usually we use a and b and c and so on and so on and so on so at the very end we sometimes some books do this A1 and A2 all the way to a sub this is just we use a and b and c and d but for to make our notation a little bit nicer we'd have the N actual uh constant where A and B and C are all constants do you want to see how to do it in practicality probably I want to end this I want to end with this example so hopefully we can do this so we leave our integral alone right now we don't we're not even worried about it we're not even doing any calculus right now it's all algebra so we're going to take the the uh integrant here and we're going to worry about the denominator right now and see if we can Factor it completely here's what you can and what you can't do you can't just Factor one little thing and assume you're done you've got to kind of show that it's completely factored you can't just Factor one little bit and go ah I'm pretty sure it's completely Factor you got to know okay it's got to be completely factored which means that we don't ever leave cubics ever uh we we often we sometimes leave quadratics but you better make sure that if you have a quadratic it's not factorable it's irreducible are are you still with me yeah okay so first step number one step don't worry about the numerator I don't care about that what I care about is factoring the denominator right now let's factor that how can you factor XB - x^2 - x pull the X out so if we do that we're going to get x * X 2 - x - 6 still okay so far of course you are it's basic algebra right all right now do we stop here you better make sure that this is not factorable if you're going to leave a quadratic is this factorable yeah it is3 pos2 so we'd have x * X and doesn't it does not matter the order not one bit - 3 x + 2 okay show Advantage be okay with that so far now here's the idea what we know then so bringing this down is that we have now 4x^2 - 4x + 6 over what this is this is the denominator it's x * x - 3 * X +2 we Factor the denominator completely no no saving factors till later no just ignoring them we factored completely this is factored completely quick hit not if you're okay with that one so far then you look at your factors how many factors do we have three three are they all unique if they weren't unique you would have combined them wouldn't you you'd have something squared or something cubed or whatever they're all unique in this case are they all linear do you see any power twos there no so here's what we do next it's not a hard thing all you got to do is say what this is going to be equal to how many factors do you have three you're going to have three fractions you're going to have X you're going to have x - 3 you're going to have x - 2 we make a fraction for every sorry plus two I know something wrong you can have a a fraction for each distinct linear factor that you have show F if you okay with that so far on the numerator these are all going to be constants this is the idea here so this is going to be a we don't call this a sub two we just call it B to make things easy and this is going to be C are we okay with that so far now the idea from here is that if you know these things are going to be equal if you can find a common denominator here then our numerators would be equal does that make sense if you can find a common denominator so that's what we work on so what we do is okay cool uh there's an easy way to do it if you were to find a common denominator for this notice that it is going to be this ultimately that is going to be our common denominator well this is only missing these two factors this is only missing these two factors this is only missing these two factors I call this the cover up method it's kind of nice all you got to do is go okay well cool uh cover up the denominator and just write the other two linear factors so if I were to find that common denominator I'm going to cover this up then we we'd have to multiply in order to find the common denominator we'd be multiplying this fraction by x - 3 x - 3 and x + 2x + 2 does that make sense to you we're not writing the denominator because of this if I ever get like a 3X overx -1 = uh 5 + 1 5 + x over x - one if I ever get that I know that these things are going to be equal If 3x = 5 + x does that make sense to you of course we'd have a domain issue with one but that's that's what we we ultimately solve this problem show should be okay with that so I'm not writing the denominators here because I know that if I get this common denominator denominators are gone anyway so I've got a * x - 3 and then x + 2 plus let's see if you can do the b b * x x cool because I'm going to cover this up I don't need another x - 3 I've already got that factor there for my common denominator I am going to however have an X and X Plus still okay let's do the C what's going to be there for the [Music] C okay now check it out what's this whole thing going to be it's going to be equal to whatever this denominator is if I have 3x x + one or x - one whatever I gave you before uh it doesn't really matter and I say this is equal to 5 + x/ x + 1 whenever your denominators are the same you can solve that problem by setting your numerator equal you can even do that with the proportion cross multiply you'll see that the X Plus 1's are gone does that make sense to you so I have I would have numerator equal to numerator if these guys are the same the idea here is that what you're trying to get is a common denom you can do this the long way you really could but you know what you get you would get a x - 3 x + 2 plus b x x + 2 plus c x X - 3 you know what this is going to be over it's going to be over x X - 3 x + 2 so basically this thing equals this thing do you see how the denominators are the same here that means the numerators get set equal to each other this will be equal to this because your denominators are exactly the same does that make sense like cross multiplication it is a it's a cross product that's right it's it's a I get it it's ultimately just a proportion that you're creating uh we are ignoring this step because we know it's going to happen we know that your denominator if you create a common denominator your denominators are going to be the same look you're keeping the exact same factors aren't you Therefore your common denominator here is this thing if we just multiply by the missing factors we inherently create a common denominator that we can ignore because it's going to be the same level size question are we going to have to about um for the denominator like x z or 3 or -2 later on yes but that's the same thing that we would have worried about here right that that's in your domain so yes yes and no uh we we don't create any I'll say it this way we don't create any additional problems with this one does that make sense to you because this already has those problems in it and when you factor it you just see the problems so we yeah we have to worry about them for sure if we have those we're going to have what's called improper integrals that's the next section we're going to cover okay so we get there ultimately but right now we're right now we're ignoring that a little bit I'll be honest with you we're ignoring it uh we will talk about that in the next section improper integrals where we go wait a minute what would happen if we integrate from uh let's see 0 to three Well we'd have a problem at zero we'd have a problem at three won't care about the negative2 it's not going to show up but we'd have a problem with those things we will deal with that uh but for right now I want you to see that we're not creating any additional issues do you see that M these are the same right same domain issues do you understand the concept of when I do this I create a common denominator and when I do a common denominator I have my numerators set equal to each other do you get that idea okay we're going to stop right there for right now we'll continue right here next time well we're going to continue so where we left off last time was how in the world do we do an integral like that where a substitution won't work where is a polinomial over polinomial hence it's rational and where the degree of our numerator is less than strictly less than the degree of our denominator where it's not I'll show you what to do in the next uh probably the next couple examples here so if this is the case what we know by some algebra theorems is that we can reduce any fraction such as this into partial fractions partial fractions work in a case-by casee basis we're either going to have all linear factors or we're going to have linear and irreducible qu quadratics or we might have repeated linear factors or repeated quadratic factors that's the idea with this now in our case when we Factor it which you have to do by the way uh you got to know that any polinomial can be decomposed into linear Andor irreducible quadratics so you'll never end with a power three it'll be either power one like here here here or power twos that you can't reduce like x^2 + 4 you can't factor that so we'd be stuck with it that that would be an irreducible quadratic are you guys with me okay so in our case we have one two three linear factors what that means is we're going to create three fractions one for each of our linear factors the way we do it we just write each of those linear factors on a denominator and constants a b c and so on and so on and so on until you exhaust all of your linear factors so far so good after that we basically find a common denominator we want to make this have the same denominator as this and I explained this hopefully very well last time if you do that the numerators themselves will be equal does that make sense so we would multiply this fraction by these two factors since they're missing that's why we get a and then x - 3 x + 2 we multiply this fraction by these two factors that's how we get an x and x + 2 this fraction by these two factors x X - 3 this is the numerator of this this this is the numerator of this and now because we have a common denominator those two things are equal show up hands if you okay with this so far all right now we get to continue and what in the world are we going to do with this uh well system equation we're going to have to we're going to have to distribute all this stuff and organize our Co organize our variables so if we do that I'm going to move quickly because this is of course well just some distribution so here we go we'll have our 4x^2 - 4x + 6 we get ax2 we get let's see + 2x - 3x - a x - 6 a I want to make sure that I'm right so can you please double check these as I'm going through just to make sure I got this stuff right too okay here we'll have plus bx2 plus 2 b x + C x^2 - 3 CX I'd like a double check if you got that same thing I'm double check my work too did you get the same thing I got okay now organize them what we're trying to do here is we're trying to match up X squ and x's and constants so for instance what I want to do is I want to look at this x s and I want to look at these x s but right now it's a little bit confusing as what's going on so we're going to factor this out so check it we're going to have do you see do you see the like terms I'm talking about we have a ax s bx2 CX2 if we factor out the x s then what this gives us is A + B + C X2 do you understand the idea hello yes no yes okay so these we've taken care of our X squs are gone then we look for any of our X's I see a ax a positive2 BX a -3 CX so we will have I always do a plus here we're just going to factor these numbers out the the coefficients are our numers so we'd have a we'd have + 2 b we'd have -3 c x so we're looking at this we're factoring out x x x therefore we have ative A+ 2 B minus 3 3 C show F feel okay with that one okay cool so those are now gone I always Circle them too that way I don't get lost what I'm doing I I definitely don't want to get lost and you can't miss a negative here or you can't screw up the coefficient if you do that your problem's smoked all right you're done so we got to be really careful with our algebra lastly well this is it there's only a minus 6 a now this is what's kind of nice about this check it out what we know is that 4x^2 - 4x + 6 equals this thing don't we well look if we know let me have your eyes up here this is kind of important if we know that 4x2 here's X2 right our X2 coefficients have to equal so if we have 4x2 and we have a + b + C X2 then what we know is this coefficient must equal this coefficient it has to equal that so we know that 4 equal A + B + C that has to be the case that's why we organize our X squ and our x's and our constants so that we can make this jump so we go hey here's an X squ here's an X squ this is four this has to be four that's the idea otherwise these things will not be equal because I have no other like terms quick head not if you're okay with that one okay let's do the next one here I have X and I have X the coefficient of this x is what4 therefore -4 equal a + 2 b - 3 C just match them up now the last one's nice I know that my constant is 6 I know that my constant is -6 a therefore six has to equal -6 a so we've grouped all we've basically factored out our our like terms from our like terms so we have a plus b plus C x^2 hey 4X S 4 must match up with a plus b plus C -4 must match up with a + 2 b - 3 C POS 6 must match up with - 6A should I feel okay with the idea now here's whatever algebra you know to solve these things for instance start easy how much is a once you know a is ne1 you get to use that fact over here to create a system of equations so if a is-1 then here we have -4 = pos1 you see why it's going to be positive 1ga 1 POS 1 + 2 b - 3 C or if I subtract the 1 -5 = 2 b - 3 C also here's our -1 here so 4 = -1 + B + C or if I add the one we'll end up getting this five ALS b + C okay so far I'm going to have to move up here I'm going to rewrite this a little bit so what I know is that a is1 what I also know is that I've Got 5 = b + C I know that -5 = -2 sorry positive 2B - 3 C okay so are you familiar with how to solve systems of equations yes all right so I have a to be and a not to be how to solve this that is the question that's right it's really good right okay anyway what do I do to solve this thing multip by yeah I'd multiply something to get some coefficient the same on one of my variables in our case we're going to multiply this by two therefore we get 10 = 2 B yeah you knew it either way uh and then five and we get 2 B minus 3 C if you do that you'll just have to subtract them if you multiply by -2 you would add them doesn't matter which way you do okay uh I'm going to choose to subtract them because I'm going to get positives are you with me on this you guys okay with that so far yeah so I'll subtract all this stuff if I subtract it 10 minus5 is 15 2 b - 2 B is 0 2 c - -3 C is 5 C 5 C are you with me on that one if you added it all you end up getting if you multiply by2 and add it you get -5 you get5 C are you still going to end up with three either way am I going too fast on algebra no okay I hope not so then C equals 3 okay I got a = 1 I've got c = 3 can you find out what B is okay how do we find out what B is yeah just plug it into whatever works for you this one's going to be the easiest so I know if a is1 that's how I found out my two systems I'm sorry two equations by using a a elimination method I've got Cal 3 that's great now that I know Cal 3 5 = b + 3 or b equals how much okay I want to make sure that we are all okay with this so far it's just some algebra but I know the algebra can be hard for for a lot of people I want to make sure you guys are all all right with it so figure out a common denominator that way your numerators are equal distribute organize so factor out your common terms here so in our our common factors in our case x^2 x and just a constant set them equal to the appropriate coefficient and then solve in whatever way works easiest for you here this was nice this is easy use that use the easy stuff to make the hard stuff easier okay now that we have a system of equations use any you can do substitution you can do elimination I don't care it's all going to work out exactly the same all you need to be able to do is find out what these letters are however many of them you have you need to know those letters feel okay with that one now here's what this means what this means is that our original integral this is the cool part our original integral because our degree here is less than our degree here it meant that I could do this because I did this and now I found out my coefficients check this out this is the awesome part now this integral becomes hey how much is our a1x plus how much is our B 2 2 x - 3 how much is our c 3 + 3 x + 2 DX if you can make that jump you understand how to do integration by partial fractions do you understand that jump right now I need to make sure that you actually do show hands if you do understand that jump the jump is use some algebra whole bunch of this is the hard part this is going to be easy okay uh if I didn't tell you this already you have learned every technique of integration that we are going to cover here uh now we're going to apply them to improper integrals so it's going be a little bit of a change we're doing this but this is all algebra so what this says is use some algebra to figure out that this is equal to this if you figure out your coefficients a b and c then this fraction is equal to -1x + 2x - 3 + 3 x + 2 hey look at that a was 1 right there b is 2 C is 3 therefore since this fraction equals this sum or partial fraction this integral equals this integral of partial fractions so far so good it's kind of neat right now the rest of the stuff is really easy really easy a lot of times not a lot of times all the time with your linear factor with your linear denominators you're going to get a whole bunch of LNS so we don't want to I don't i' never like to write more than I absolutely have to so when I do this I do all these in my head um because I'm I'm used to doing the substitution if it takes you some substitution off to the side do it but here's the deal how I do this integral I'd say hey look at this the integral of 1x is Ln X Ln Ln absolute remember absolute value so this integral the integral of one/ x is Ln absolute value of x since it's negative we just have a negative out front it's the negative is that constant it's a negative one so if we have a coefficient the coefficient just stays there quick head and aren you okay with that one now this one by rights you should be doing a substitution shouldn't you however if you did a substitution on this the derivative is one which means you're not going to be changing that coefficient whatsoever if this was like a 2x - 3 yeah you probably have to do a little something with that I would probably still do to my head um I do a little substitution my head I I would know how to do that I get a 1/2 but you'd have to take that into account but notice that if it's linear you can always do that quick substitution and it's still going to be an Ln the integral is still going to give you an Ln are you following so in our case if you had to do u = x - 3 D DX okay that's fine do up to the side that's okay I'm going to be a little bit quicker on that because I'm going to assume at this level that you understand how to do this right now okay so you could split this up up and do it independently of each other here we're going to have a plus what's going to be out front and then Ln absolute value x - 3 then another plus this is our coefficient 3 Ln integral x + two just please please be careful on this part let me have your eyes on the board here real quick be careful of this if you had a two right here or some other coefficient this is not the correct integral this is not the correct answer what would happen is you would do i' do I'd still do it in my head but I'd get okay dual 2 DX that would give me a 1/2 that's what that would be can you follow that one yeah if you got that then you're probably pretty good at this uh and you're fine but if you're not getting like w what's it coming from then take some time on your own and actually do the substitution off to the side you can't get these things wrong well you can I mean I don't want you to don't get these things wrong the constants and the coefficients are very important here so if fence you feel okay with with this one so do you understand that if I have linear factors I'm going to get a lot of LNS because it's going to be one over a power x to the power one I'm going to get a lot of Ln here now let me change it back this was not the case just want to show that to you this was not the case uh how do I W oh yep sorry this one too how do I wrap this up done that's the whole idea what's the hard part is it the integral no no hard part is this doing all this stuff show P feel okay with this one now would you like it if I showed you a shortcut that applies to a lot of these problems especially the linears you want to see that yes okay remember these numbers we can cheat we can cheat a lot so you have this written down correct are there any questions on this should be pretty straightforward I wanted to give this to you by the way uh sometimes you have to do this technique because you can't do the cheating way I'm about to give you but with linear factors especially cheat at it here's how you cheat at it it's not even cheating it's just being [Applause] smart if you want to be smart about this this is an equation correct M which means it should be able to give my coefficients if I plug the right numbers in so what you do is you leave it in terms of factors like this and this and this and this you leave it just like this and then you plug in numbers that make your factors go to zero plug in values that make your factors go to zero for instance when I look at this I go hey um and you have to show this this little part if I let xals 0 check your out if I let x equal 0 this yeah that's ne3 but how much is that zero this whole thing is gone does it make sense this would go to zero if I let x equal 0 this whole thing is gone does that make sense if I let x equals 0 this is a * -3 * pos2 because X is now zero you followed on the other side if x is equal to zero this is zero this is zero how much is that then we would get 6 = a * -3 * 2 let me go over one more time to make sure you're with me okay plug in values that make some of your factors go to zero you will have repeated factors okay so I'm thinking hey uh the easiest one to plug in if I plug in zero this is not zero this is not zero but this is 0 times anything is what folks this whole thing's gone 0 time anything is zero whole thing's gone this is also zero this is also Z so if I plug in Z 0 0 6 got it a no problem3 no problem two no problem 0 0 gone can you solve that yeah so quick so 6 = -6 a a equals 1 hey is that what we got yep brilliant now we got a couple more to do don't do anything more with this right now by the way um I always start with this always I always get as many as I can sometimes you'll still have to distribute but at least you got a couple that makes that makes some of this kind of irrelevant if you have a if you knew what B was you could find C very easy without having to do systems of equations okay so this is a very F much faster way of doing things if you can sometimes you can't but if you can yeah try plugging in some numbers that give you zero or on some of your your uh your big terms here so big terms make some factors equal zero give me another number that would work three would be a great number to plug in do you see why okay so if I plug in three I always put what I'm plugging in so x = 3 and then I put a little couple uh couple dots are here if I plug in three let's see can you figure out what I'm going to have on the left hand side if I plug in three notice I'm plugging in three not zero this doesn't go to six again you actually have to plug in the three what do you get 30 30 we double check on the 30 do you get 30 plug it in plug in three I want everyone to do this right now plug in three 30 triple check 30 yes uh a 30 person check 30 you get so if I plug in three I get 30 equals let's look what happens check it out if I plug in three please follow me up here this is how you you're going to get this stuff quickly okay not spend 30 minutes on just the setup plugin three what happens here this whole thing zero plug in three what happens here does it go to zero no this is B * 3 * 5 see where the three and the five are coming from three five plug in three here what happens this is why we plugged in three to make our Factor zero you multiply by Z it's gone see how easy that makes it we now we have 30 = 15 B how much is B hey we're two for two it's cool once you do the last on your own what number will you be plugging in if you do left one your own -2 yeah very good not two but -2 be careful on evaluating right here make sure you have your signs correct it's a big deal you have to get your signs correct here I know it's algebra but remember people take calculus to finally fail Algebra I want that to be you make sure your signs are right what' you get when you plugged in negative two over here you got 30 you get 30 positive 30 yes I plug in -2 what happens to this term what happens to this term what happens to this term you get a c you get a -2 and you get A5 see where the numbers came from plug in that2 well then we got 30 = POS 10 C or c = 3 did we end up getting the same numbers we got over here which way is quicker this way this way is obviously quicker does it work all the time no it doesn't work all the time especially when you have nonreducible quadratics because if you have non-reducible quadratics then you can't plug in a number that gives you zero like X2 + 4 you can't do that that factor is not going to be equal to zero ever therefore you can't use this technique with that you can use it for parts of it so like if you have a linear Factor man use it for the linear Factor Make That zero at least it gives you some of those numbers you follow me so fans feel okay with this part after that man you go through the same stuff so let's try this now I'm stick with this technique when I can because obviously it's a lot quicker let's do a different example are there any questions on this before I erase it all because we're going to need some space for this stuff you ready okay so new example let's talk about X to 4 - 3x^2 - 3x - 2 all over x 3r - x^2 - 2x DX tell me something about this problem that was different that is different from the last one that we did what's different the degrees the degrees are different remember what I told you about alra algebra said that if the degree here is less than the degree here then it can be written as partial fractions I said if uh is the degree here less than the degree here no no if it's listen if your degree of your numerator is larger than or equal to the degree here so if this was even a degree three we'd still have to do the following step what we're going to do is shoot guys I mean think about it if your degree here is bigger than or equal to the degree here that means you can divide it so we're going to divide div it by long division and then what that's going to do is reduce that degree so if you have like the last example where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator start immediately Factor immediately and go for it if you have like this example the degree here is bigger than or equal to the degree here then you have to do long division and then you'll get to start your problem finding does that make sense to you so we're going to do long division I'm I don't know if you are that good at long division I'm not sure that you've seen it in a while um but here's how you do it we are going to go quickly through it you can refresh your memory if you want to on some of the videos I have for intermediate algebra that's where we cover it in u the appendices of that class so here we go I'm going need more space how we do long division of polinomial is we take our numerator and we divide by our denominator now when you're dividing your numerator when you're dividing your numerator please keep in mind you need at least a placeholder for every potential power of x that you have so if you do this look at the board please if you do this and just go right on down the line right here you're going to have an error you're going to have a mistake because what happens is when I divide X to 4 uh with my x to the 3 I'm going to end up getting something here I'm going to get an x to the 3 somewhere so the problem is 0 x yeah we're going to put a it's like a place value holder saying hey how many X cubes do you have zero have none of them put zero and then finish it off - 3x^2 - 3x - 2 so this is the same as this we got X 4th no X cubes - 3x2 - 3x - 2 and this is our denominator so far so good okay let's continue how we start this thing is basically just the first term divided by the first term so what do I get when I divide X 4th by X the 3r X and then we distribute we get X 4th check this out this is why we had to have a place value holder we get ne or - x 3r and we get min - 2 X 2 it's got to match up if it doesn't match up then you've made a mistake you forgot to place Val holder somewhere after that what do we do change signs yeah you can we're subtracting you either put parentheses here or you subtract and you change all the signs I like the parentheses to show what I'm doing X 4th minus x 4 is 0 0 x 3r minus X 3r you can change your sign and make that a plus if you want this will be positive X Cub this will be -3x plus sorry uh- 3x^2 + 2x^2 is X2 and then we bring down our next term yes I'm going fast but you should know at least a little bit how to do this are you all still with me so far yes okay and we start over how many times does X 3r go into X3 and it's positive 1 so we'll put plus one and then we distribute we get x 3r - x^2 - 2x again we are subtracting again we'll have parentheses you either change signs or do it in your head I do it in my head x3 - x3r is 0 uh x^2 + x^2 is 0 -3x plus 2X is and we bring down Rus 2 now we check again does x 3 go into x no then this is our remainder that's our remainder here's how you write your remainder what this says is that this fraction is the same thing as x + 1 this is our quotient here plus the remainder ofx - 2 over and when you write your remainder it's always as your remainder over your original denominator are you okay with that so far mhm just don't make the silly mistake of doing this please let me have your eyes on the board right now so you see this a lot of mistakes here are not calculus mistakes they're sign mistakes they're sign errors if you do this and you go oh look at that minus uh Mr Le's silly why don't you just put minus I don't put a minus there because this sign is wrong right now do you know that that's incorrect so what I'll do is I'll put a plus with my negative I'll put this on the numerator I'll put my plus sign there because you can always add but later so here's what you'd have to do to change that sign you'd actually have to factor out your negative here does that make sense if you factor out your negative this becomes x + 2 and that's that's something that we can deal with so I'm going to any questions on Long Division at all okay so this is what we get so then we know our integral is now x + 1 no problem then look at this plus and negative that's minus x + 2 x 3r - x^2 - 2x DX so we do long division what long division does long division is kind of nice with this look at this it pulls out some terms some terms here that are really easy to integrate we got an X can you do the integral of x can you all do the integral of x it's a piece of cake can you do the excuse me integral of one absolutely and it gives us a fraction where the numerator the degree of the numerator has been reduced and that's the idea of division so our remainder here is what counts our remainder is what makes this process a little doable for us we have this remainder ofx - 2 factor out the negative before you change it sign that is a must you have to do that if you have a negative there so feel okay with that if it wasn't if it was just a positive x - 2 that's fine leave it as plus you're good to go but if that's a negative sometime often times I'll factor that that negative out it makes it a little bit nicer to see can we move on so what are we going to do about this thing easy easy maybe split up your integral and see what's going on here so that's what we're going to do I'm going to take and make a little asteris here on this part I'm going to keep the negative here now don't lose track that you have a minus when you have a minus whatever we get listen please whatever we get is going to be in a bracket this minus we're going to treat like a negative 1 being multiplied onto that bracket it's going to change all of our signs are you following me on this one so you can think of this put a circle or put a big bracket right now that's what I typically do and we'll pull this off to the side and we'll work with it so here's our here's our piece right here at the same time maybe we can Factor this guy let's Factor this what factors out of XB - X2 - 2x if we got that we got x^2 - x - 2 can I go further yes remember you don't just Factor once and say I'm probably good uh you got to kind of prove that if you have a quadratic it's irreducible that you can't that you can't Factor it uh that would be done by doing a discriminant and finding out that's negative if you do a discriminant and it's negative that means you have a complex roote and that therefore it can't be factored so you'd prove that or You' at least go through it in your head now this can be factored what is it okay we've done a lot of work so far but I want to make sure that we're good so we start the problem off we look at it we go oh degree is not less than this one that means long division I've done long division I erased it I know we do long division this is our quotient of long division with our remainder of long division how you write your quotient is you always write quotient plus remainder if we have remainder over our first denominator this denominator then if it's a negative maybe factor out the negative it changes it to a minus so we get x +1 minus x+2 over our original denominator and now easy easy ah is a degree less than the the degree of the numerator less than the degree of denominator yes now we can go ahead and do this what I want you to do right now I want you to write out what this should be equal to U make your different fractions however many that you need and put the appropriate letters up top it's it's a small step but it's important step I want to see if you can do it how many fractions are we going to get however many different linear factors you have that is how many different fractions you end up getting what's going to be our first denominator please denominator X and then X and then X does it matter which order you have these in so if you factor this different well you can't Factor differently but if you have your factors out of order compared to this one no big deal you're going to do the same thing it's just your pieces of your integral will be a little switched around all right same idea no problem addition is commutative so we're good uh what's going to be on our numerators what's this going to be a b and c so fans feel okay with this so far we've done a lot of algebra huh have we done any calculus no we're not going to for a while either so we got long division check it we got this no problem partial fractions we have it all set up remember that when you have linear linear is power one when you have linear factors we make a fraction for every different factor and we put constants up top up top a b c and so on and so on and so on until we exhaust all of our distinct linear factors still okay so far now go ahead I want you to do this on your own create the common denominator use the coverup method I taught you last time so what I want to see next I don't need to see one fraction equal one fraction I want to see x + 2 equals and then just give me what this is equal to go for it so use the idea of finding a common denominator once you find a common denominator that means your numerators get to be set equal to each other if you've already done that try finding a b and c use the easy way if you can if I find a common denom what that is is that you end up multiplying each fraction by the missing factors in your particular denominator so here I have a factor of X I'm missing a factor of x - 2 I'm missing a factor of x +1 for B in order to create a common denominator I have the factor of x - 2 I have that already I'm missing the factor of x and x +1 so we have plus b * x and x + 1 just the missing factors of your LCD of your common denom lastly we got plus C I'm missing X and I'm missing x - 2 show you got that far on your own good that's fantastic that's a whole idea now can you find a b and c by plugging in some different numbers hello can you do that tell me the three numbers you'd probably plug in here zero for sure and then what two would be one and then the other one yeah plug those numbers in if you haven't done already go ahead and do that so when x equals z that's nice some of your factors are going to go some of your terms actually some of your terms are going to go to zero when x = 2 some of your terms are going to go to zero when x = -1 some of your terms are going to go to zero unfortunately man you got a this is nice to plug stuff into right a square over there that's that's beautiful I'm start working on this for the sake of time but I want to understand if you if you I want to know if you guys understand the idea here so we're checking for numbers that change some of your factors to zero if your factors change to zero some of your terms are going to go to zero so when I plug in zero start from the left 0 + 2 is 2 a okay if I plug in zero here I get -2 and I get 1 so this is a * -2 * 1 1 plus well that's a zero now I'm plugging in zero this goes a zero this goes a zero I'm good to go now let's plug in two if I plug in two don't forget you have to actually plug it in here 2 + 2 is 4 equals if I plug in two 2 - 2 is z this whole term is gone 2 - 2 is z this whole ter term is gone I get B * 2 * 3 did you get 2 * 3 B * 2 * 3 good lastly if I plug in 1 remember actually plug it in 1 + 2 is if I plug in1 here this is zero whole term gone this is zero whole term gone this is not zero I get C * one that's what I'm plug it in time3 should you made it that far good deal now we're almost done here so simplify a little bit 2 = -2 a therefore a equal how much 1 4 = 6 B therefore b equals how much is it okay to get a fraction yes don't worry about it 1 = 3 c c = 13 hey look at that those were the three constants I was looking for a b and c what that means is that our our original actually right here our original integral changes to this please watch very carefully on how I do this I want to make sure all our signs are correct you guys are okay to this point right did this make sense to you yes now that we have our A and C check it out what I know is that our integral is X don't forget about this stuff + one minus I put my big bracket so this should look identical x + 1 minus big bracket now inside that big bracket we just did a partial fraction of this thing what I know is that the partial fraction of this thing right here equals ax + BX - 2 plus CX + 1 do I have my a my B and my C then what this is equal to is -1 /x plus just do the look at just do the fraction like this 23 x - 2 don't worry about that +3 x + 1 DX a big bracket let me double check to make sure you guys are good with it uh do you see how this becomes these three fractions we found ab and C right so if we know this is equal to hey a plus b plus C over these relative denominators we got1 overx perfect we get 2/3 x - 2 got it we got 1/3 x + 1 not a problem what are we going to do next integrate no we're not going to integrate now we're going to make sure our signs are correct so what are we going to do now distribute that so x + 1 + 1X - 23 x - 2 - 1/3 x + 1 DX on the whole thing are you ready for the last little part yeah interesting yes interesting we can actually do it huh kind of weird but all it is is algebra it's same it's rational break it up into fractions not even a big deal now that you've broken up into fractions these are all easy to do what's the integral of um X I'm going to write that as 12 x s you okay with that what's the integral of one what's the integral everybody should know this integral of 1x L abute value cool we got this one we got this one we got L and absolute value of x we're going to have a minus sign here's how you deal with this look at uh look at the board here real quick you keep your constant just like we did in the previous example so this will be two can write it correctly I thought it 2/3 2/3 comes out front remember if this was an integral by itself look it if this was an integral by itself so integral DX you pull out the 2/3 would you you have 1X - 2 you do a little substitution u = x - 2 du = DX there's no constant pulling forward you're good to go then You' resubstitute back in for = xus 2 it's the same idea we've been doing so 2/3 comes out we'd have an Ln we' have an absolute value x - 2 CL absolute value it's really you're you learn some of the basic U substitution so that allows you to do this in your head um otherwise we spend forever doing this stuff um so so yeah if you need it do it uh but if you don't if you can do it like this that that's fine we've learned enough about this to be okay with that minus minus what3 uhhuh are you supposed to forget those absolute values no absolutely not uh no and then 12 x s x Ln absolute value x 2/3 forward another Ln 1/3s forward another Ln show P feel okay with what we done awesome all right we're on to our next example let's take a look at this integral now of course the first things we check for this just like any integral is does it fit anything we can do that's easy does it fit a substitution of course not does it fit integration by parts no it doesn't trig trig sub no nothing like that then we start thinking about okay think about this as a rational as a partial fraction is the degree here less than the degree here well that's great when it wasn't what do we have to do when it's not if we do our long division then it reduces the degree of the numerator and we go for partial fractions after that I believe our last example was like that one right okay so if we don't have uh something that we have to do long division with we jump straight into the partial fraction what's the first step in doing partial fractions fact factoring yeah not the numerator I don't care about that but denominator for sure so let's go ahead let's Factor the denominator can you factor x Cub + x^2 - x -1 yes I can can you factor it what do you do when you have four terms you group them try grouping them unless you see an obvious Factor like uh of course a GCF like X number or something yeah okay cool fact of that uh but if you don't see that try factoring by grouping for four terms if that doesn't work you have to find a root so you'd have to guess and check for a root or find some other method there are more advanced ways to factor uh I'm not going to teach him here that's an a higher class on how to factor Cubix and cortic and to prove that quintics are not factorable it takes a long time to prove that uh but you prove it for five and higher you can't generally Factor it for four and lower you can't there's formulas for it um but for for us to make it easy you factor a GCF first if you can like an X if it goes into all the terms if not try factoring by grouping if not then you have to come up with something that actually works like a number that gives you zero and then you can factor out x minus that number and that's the idea you can do that by division or synthetic division so anyhow for grouping we'd have our X cubed I'm going to erase this in a second so make sure you have this down - x - one grouping works like this you group the first two terms and you factor out the GCF you group the last two terms and you factor out the GCF notice when I factor out negative one it changes my sign and then you factor this out and we get x + 1 and we get x^2 minus one we okay with that so far yeah now is this good enough for us what's the problem with that okay so when we say Factor we mean we imply factored completely factoring means this factoring means linear and or irreducible quadratics so if I end right here with x +1 and x^2 -1 this one's great that's cool that's linear linear means power One X to the first Power you with me yeah this one this is quadratic that would be cool if it was plus if it's plus you're done do you see why yeah you can't Factor X Plus X2 + 1 but if it's x^2 - 1 that means you have to keep going so we'd do x + 1 and we do x + 1 x -1 so if F feel okay with that one now when you factor something we do want to make this in simplest form so what we're going to do I'm going to write this uh a little bit backwards I'm going to write x - one then I'm going to write x + 1 yeah listen I know it's basic algebra but I want to make sure you're okay with it are you okay by fact with factoring by grouping yeah do you understand that we are not going to stop right here with this thing we're going to factor as much as we possibly can till we get down to linear or irreducible quadratic show fans feel okay with that so far then I like to rewrite it as linear factors first everyone does this linear factors first and then powers of linear factors and then irreducible quadratics and then power and irreducible quadratics that's typically the way that we we write these so we've got linear and then linear to the second power you guys okay with this so far so I'm going to change this I'm going to say no no no no this is not good enough this is actually x - one and then x + 1 to the 2 power any questions on this before I erase it so we have Factor by grouping we continued to factor we grouped our factors that were the same so X+ one we now this is different you see before what we had was we had unique linear factors remember that and we set this up as a x -1 and then b x + 1 stuff like that well when we have these repeated linear factors that's actually case number two so case two is when we have repeated linear factors here's what we mean by repeated it means that you have more than one of them so for instance we have uh x -1 we had an x + 1 and we had another x + 1 that's why we had this X+1 squ this Factor was repeated hence the square if it was repeated G we have to the3 power you guys with me on this one so here's how you do it with any repeated linear factors what we end up doing is we write A1 over the first Factor plus A2 over that factor to whatever power we have and we continue until we run out of the repeated factors so for instance if this was to the fifth power what you'd end up doing would you you'd have A1 over whatever linear fraction you okay and you'd exhaust those powers of linear factors I'll show you in a minute how to do that if we had a 5th you'd have A1 over the factor a a different one so B you'd have B over the factor squared then C over the factor to the 3 then D over the factor to the 4th then e over the factor to the 5th you have every single different power of that factor are you with me on this one let me show you how it works here for us so in our case what we're going to end up getting is how many fractions do you think we're going to get here we're still going to get three that's right so we're still going to have one look at this two and again three do you understand why we have three fractions here yes we still have those three factors initially we still do it just one was repeated and so what we're going to have what do you think is going to be my first denominator x -1 x - one's going to be there you guys with me and then what we do is we say okay have we exhausted all the powers of x - one yeah there was just one of them we're good now we move on to the next one x + 1 X+ one's got to be here have we exhausted all the powers of x + 1 no so we go x + 1qu very good okay let's see if you're paying attention what if this was to the 4th power keep going two more i' have X+ 1 3r X+ 1 to 4 does that make sense to you so this one hey we're done with that one this one would be to the first then to the second then to the third and to four until you get all the powers up there until you exhaust all of them you with me on that one because we have these different factors if you had this you really have x + one and then another sorry x -1 then x + 1 * x + 1 * x + you'd have five factors there we show those powers to show those different possibilities of those factors now where did I stop what was that one two okay good now fortunately for us they're still linear right they're still linear so all we need on the numerators are A and B and C and then we do exactly the same thing we did before so now we have two cases we have the cases where we have distinct linear factors where we have x - one and it doesn't happen again we have X plus one and it doesn't happen again that was our first case and that case is pretty straightforward uh we just have every different Factor on the denominator a b c d e whatever until you you exhaust them you guys with me on that one then now we have the second case we've got the case where we might have some repeated linear factors for those linear factors that aren't repeated do the same thing exactly the same for those ones that are repeated have the first Power then have the second power this is the idea of partial fractions this is how it works you guys okay with it now can we make a common denominator still be smart about it when I'm making the common denominator remember the idea is make a common denominator then ignore the denominator so ultimately we're going to have 2X + 3x + 7 equal to whatever I get upon finding my common denominator here's the whole deal though listen listen and look you're going to have with repeated linear a lot of the same things aren't you use the largest power here so when I find my common denominator on this fraction of course I'm not multiplying by this guy I already got that guy but look over here I need to match this up I'm not missing x -1 I'm missing the x +1 sared don't take both of them just take the largest power does that make sense to you so I don't need this and this this one kind of counts for for this one as well this this is the only thing only Factor I'm missing you can see that on this previous fraction in order to find a common denominator with this I would just have to multiply by x + 1 to the thir or to the second second to the second so far so good it's just algebra but I want to make sure you're good with it plus so we covered up we take the largest power that is what's given us our common denom Now we move on to the B what's missing on this B fraction x - okay x - one is missing look you can look here if I cover that up what's missing here well x X - one is missing from there what else is missing from here squares the squares okay so do I multiply by X x + 1^ S would that be a good idea no no no don't do that that's way too much what should I multiply by you're only missing one factor of the X+ one are you guys getting that so this no so when I look here yeah I was missing x + one but more than that I'm missing X+1 s that's why we're multiplying by this I'm missing this whole Factor here with the B I've got one factor of X+1 already I'm only missing one more this look at this this would give us the x +1 2 and this would give us x -1 so I'm missing x -1 and one factor of x +1 from the C let's look at the C what am I missing from here to here what's missing that's it so I wouldn't take this one I've already got it it's like trading cards you go uh I got two Jose conos I got another Jose cono do you need it no I don't got two of them I don't need another Jose cono let you just want to make some money and sell cards but we already got those we don't we don't need extra one we have enough of our Jose conos that's a weird analogy wasn't it anyway question so because you already have the x + One S on the bottom you only need xus one for C that's correct basically we're looking at these fractions and some people teach it cover this up take the rest of it okay not this one but the largest power um I prefer you to think of we're finding a common denominator so look here look here what's missing between here and here x x + 1 to the second power is missing we need X+1 the second look here look here what's missing x -1 and one factor of x + one does that make sense look here look here what's missing that's it not X+ one you already have the X+1 squ honestly show pant feel okay with with that so far now did I teach you the the uh plug up that cheating way yes is the cheating way going to work for here no put one why not can you make this zero yeah of course you can can you make this zero yeah can you make this zero yeah can you make this zero then why would that work it works for linears works really well for linear all right it doesn't work for quadratics uh we'll we'll learn about that in a minute so why don't you go ahead and do that as I do on the board see if you can find the correct coefficients of a b and c so tell me the numbers that you are probably going to be plugging in here one and definitely negative 1 we try those right off the bat because negative 1's going to give us some zeros one's going to give us some zeros we'll be able to find at least two of these things for the last one I'll teach you how to do that in a minute so plugging in what did you already do them go for it I really want you to try it plug it in one if I plug in one 1 - one is z this is gone 1 - one is z this whole thing is gone one oh 1 + one that's two squ so all I know is that 12 = a * 2^ 2 did you guys get that as well 4 a I think a is three did you get a is three yeah awesome now do negative 1 do the one's first first so1 if I plug in NE 1 what I know is that on this side I get oh man what is that 2 - 3 + 7 how much did you get six okay so if I plug in negative 1 1 + 1 is 0 whole term gone 1 + 1 is 0 whole term gone 1 oh1 minus one how much is that2 so C * -2 what's c equal now here's an issue did it give you a b so I plugged in the numbers that give me zero I got a and c I didn't get B here's a little trick uh when you get down to here and like wait a second with these repeated uh linears this happens a lot okay because you're going to have stuff that looks like this where there's not a number there's no X there's no number you can actually plug in um oh you know what while I'm thinking of it as well so let me think of this right now if I had x to the 3 power like this if I had x to the 3 that would count as repeated linear this is not irreducible quadratic this repeated linear you'd have something over X plus something over X2 plus something over X 3r you have a d and e and f does that make sense to you so X the 3 is repeated linear X and then X2 and then X 3r okay just while it was on my mind wanted to clear that up I some of your problems are like that so let's say that we don't have a number that gives us zero for one whole term just pick another number to plug in something easy I would plug in probably zero just plug in zero you can plug in any number you want correct if I plug in zero yeah it's not going to get rid of anything but it's going to make it easier to do so i' plug in xal 0 check it if I plug in x equals 0 what happens on the left hand side s if I plug in xal 0 over here well all I'm going to get is a * 1^ 2 or a * 1 then I'm going to get B * let's plug in zero here if I plug in zero I'm going to get negative 1 I'm going to get positive one plus if I plug in zero here I'm going to get C * 1 ladies and gentlemen did you follow that just pick another easy number to plug in for these linear it's kind of nice if I plug in well not one I already dealt with that negative one I dealt with that those were the easy ones right those give us lots of zeros take another number you plug in anything you want to you plug in seven or 12 or -5 or one well you already did it or zero one in different case but plug in whatever you want and that way you get well an equation seven on the left hand side over here we get 7 = a - B- C hey this is why we did this first do you know how much a is yeah do you know how much B is no not b not B do you know how much C is yeah plug him in and find it so once you deal with a couple of these factors the rest of them become pretty darn easy as far as linear go oops so we've got 3 minus B and then plus three because we have minus a negative looks like we're going to get what Al together this would be 6 subtract the 6 we get 1 = b or b = 1 okay honestly that's the hard part finding out the A and the C at this point hey we're ready to split this thing up so it okay with this so far so what we know is that our original integral of 2x^2 + 3x + 7 over x 3r + x^2 - x - 1 DX is now equal to a brand new integral let's put this thing all together what we knew is that partial fractions said this can be broken up like this one two three fractions what it said was my denominators are x -1 that's going to be easy x + 1 that's going to be easy x +1 s well a little different but not such a big deal on the numerators it said that well provided you find a common denominator we did and can solve for these coefficients a b c we did then you know the coefficients of your fractions or basically the numerators of your fractions three don't get these out of out of order okay three from a and then negative one yeah negative one goes here you guys okay with that and then lastly it's three I'd probably clean this up a little bit we just want to make sure our numbers are correct so put them in the same order you did it okay so x -1 x + 1 x + 1 2 we double check x -1 x + 1 x + 2 we want a over x -1 so 3 X - 1 we want b/ x + 1 so -1 x + 1 we want c x +1 2 -3 x +1 2 so far so good maybe clean this up cuz it's kind of ugly looking so instead of plus negatives let's make this integral of 3 X -1 - 1 x + 1 - 3 x + 1^ 2 DX let's see if you remember how to do these remember how to do this integral that's not bad at all what's that going to be sure this is a you sub we do in our head the derivative of X+ 1 is simply one so DX = du it'll be deal so this would be a constant 3 Ln x + one in absolute value so far so good minus what very good so no problem no problem uh is this also an Ln is this also an Ln be careful this is not an Ln Ln is a quantity to the first Power this one maybe think of this as a different integral maybe pull that three out pull this x + one to the -2 if you were given this in calculus you'd be able to do it this is actually pretty easy uh I don't know if they teach you yeah they teach you substitution and calculus one don't they you'd be able to do this just fine don't forget the stuff you know don't make it harder than it is don't be throwing LNS all over the place when it's not an Ln this is hey that's a power that's a -2 so when we do this we' have three because of our constant we'd have x + 1 to the -1 because you add and then you divide by 1 because you divide by your new exponent what that would become is -3 over x +1 I want to verify that you guys are okay with this this would be -3 over x + one yes no you sure okay so notice how we took this piece away so I have minus that piece3 x + 1 clean it up just a little bit we'll have 3 Ln absolute value x -1 - Ln absolute value x + 1 plus 3x + 1 and finally let me know I'm done oh kind of I'm going to show you one more thing with this here's what I want to know are you guys okay with the algebra of getting our partial fractions yes no are you okay with integral of this guy and this one how about that one that should really be okay right cuz we're we're used to this bring up that exponent sure no problem x + 1 -2 uh do a use you do a little substitution but it's just x + one no big deal if this was like 2 x + 1 you'd have a 1/2 are you with me so here I mean no problem I know I'm doing it in my head I get it I'm not supposed to maybe but it's a that's straight substitution so we' have a u to the1 we have -3 over U then we' have3 x +1 you reset that right back in there since we're subtracting a negative we change to a plus add a plus c on there now one little thing I want to talk about occasionally you're going to get some problems that look different when you're doing these um repeated linear factors or even linear factors because what happens is you get a lot of LNS being added and subtracted and with coefficients out front now what we know from our chapter six work with linear oh sorry with exponentials and logarithms is that these really mean exponents this really means a division so occasionally you'll get stuff like this you say okay well this can translate to just to make it nicer looking Ln of x -1 to 3 over x + 1 in absolute value + 3 x + 1 + C your exponent this is how you would do this in order your exponent would move up it would become an exp going on x - one subtracting two Ln is a division problem notice the Q does not go to both it goes just to this first one your numerator are you okay with that one can't really do much with this one so you leave it but that's another way you could see the answer here we sure we're okay with that how you feel all right with that you guys ready to move on a little bit there any questions comments or concerns am I making this straightforward enough for you guys understand it okay well there's a couple of cases that we got to master so let's continue moving on most of these are going to take us at least one space of the board so if there's any questions I need to know now because I'm race most of it you got it all that nice work here we go oh my okay well that looks fun let's go ahead and do that one let's run through the whole process proc of solving integrals all right because on your test that I'm going to give you I'm not going to tell you what to do you're going to look at and go oh yeah okay I know what to do here so let's pretend this is a test situation you look at this problem and go go ahead and do it and you go uh what do you check for first the denominator I would check for substitution honestly that's what I would check for is this the derivative of this thing disregarding constants it's not but I check that first because if it is that's an easy problem that's really really fast you with me i' check it first after that you go okay well does it look like anything we've had before any like a uh integration by parts no it's not a product those are typically products um does it have any trigonometry in it any square roots or something we can turn into trigonometry and completing the square no it's a cubic partial fractions yeah looks like a partial fraction to me okay something we could use partial fractions for the first thing we check I think you guys said it first what do we check the degre yeah degree on the numerator has to be less than the degree on denominator or you do what with it yeah and that reduces the degree of the numerator for you so that's great so here we're good to go no long division necessary thankfully uh okay now that we've determined that we're going to do partial fractions what's your first step break it up break it factoring yeah we're going to factor it and we're going to factor by Aon said we're going to factor by grouping why don't you try Factor by grouping go for it I'm wonder if you get the same thing I did did you get 2x - one and then did you get x^2 - 4 plus oh good I was texting you you passed did you get a plus4 if you got let me have your eyes on the board here real quick you you guys okay with the grouping by the way you'll notice what I'm writing is the linear first you see that now if you had an x^2 minus 4 would you stop right here no if you have an X2 + 4 do you continue going no can you factor X2 + 4 no if you start factoring this as x - 2x + 2 your problem is going down the the poooo hole all right that's uh that's not good we can't start factoring like we don't know what we're doing here so this is your first case of an irreducible quadratic that's this next case right here case number three is when you have irreducible quadratics irreducible quadratics so we've factored by grouping it worked we had 2x - 1 no problem our remaining factor is x^2 + 4 this one okay what's what is this is this a quadratic or is this a linear linear you're automatically done there's no more factoring than that you're done is this a linear or quadratic quadratic can you reduce it more then it stays an irreducible quadratic for irreducible quadratics what we do we write the irreducible quadratic if we have powers we'd write it again and again so we write the first irreducible quadratic and then the second irreducible quadratic 2 two two and then the third one and so on until we exhaust all of our irreducible quadratics and on the numerators this hopefully this makes sense to you whatever Factor you have your numerator should be 1° lower than that so for linear one de lower than a linear is a constant 1° lower than a quadratic is a linear so for linears we'd have that's what we had here we had a we had B we had c one de lower does that make sense to you for our our linear for quadratics we're going to have linear ax plus b CX plus d and so on and so forth and so on and so forth this is the idea here so P feel okay with with that one now let's put that into practice with our problem here so notice how our cases are kind of they're building right we're building on what we already we already know so if you have a linear and you have an irreducible quadratic you're going to do two different things in the same problem how many fractions are we going to have here what do you think are there any factors to a power no okay so this is one factor this is another Factor are they repeated no no okay that's our next case Okay is when you actually repeat these so is this repeated no that's just one factor is this repeated that's just one factor you can't reduce it right so it's irreducible quadratic that means you're going have two fractions okay tell me folks what's going to be on my first denominator 2 is that linear or quadratic I know I've asked but is it linear quadratic okay what's on my next fraction is that linear or quadratic quadratic it's irreducible remember you got to make sure that you have simplified this or factored this as much as possible show hands feel okay with this so far it's the same idea you have a number of factors make a fraction for each factor that's it now on the numerators it's important you get this right get it correct for every linear we put a constant for every quadratic we put a linear one degree lower than what we have we do that for every single fraction typically this is why I write my linear first and then my quadratics so I don't lose any okay so I have to go back and forth so here what's going to be here that's right what do I want to do an ax plus b no it's linear I want a constant for linears how about this one do I put just a b BX plus C good what I want is a linear for a quadratic so constants for our linear that's what we've been doing here folks that's that's what this is then a linear for my quadratic notice how the degree is one lower this is X to the 1st this is X to the 0 this is X to the second this is X to the 1st it's 1° lower that's the whole idea should P be okay with that one then you're good to go that's it same stuff after this so why don't you guys go ahead and tell me what I would do to get a common denominator on my first fraction what's the missing Factor here remember the way I do it I look here and I look here what's missing from here to here so I have a and x^2 + 4 plus I look here and I look here what's missing from here to here 2 so the way this looks is BX + C remember it's the whole numerator time I'm sorry what what's missing there 2 so again for the last time hopefully when we find a common denominator we multiply by the missing factors on both the numerator denominator we do the missing factors are x^2 + 4 we have this one we're missing x^2 + 4 so that's why we got our a * X2 + 4 here we're missing the 2x - one we already got this we're missing the 2x - one that goes here and here as soon as we get that common denominator we ignore it we just set the numerators equal to each other so this numerator equals this new numerator this would be the numerator you follow just keep in mind it's a * this one this x to x - 4 and then it's this whole BX + C * the 2x -1 so feel okay with that now this is what I was talking about as far as sometimes you can cheat and sometimes you can't right now it's going to be pretty difficult to cheat at this thing and plug in a number that's going to work and the reason why it's going to be a little difficult to cheat is because if we plug in stuff like oh I don't know a number to make this Zero we' have to come up with 1/2 1/2 is going to be difficult to plug in here and difficult to plug in here and difficult plug in over there okay you can do you can try it you can't plug in things like uh like zero if you want so zero would give you -1 * * C and it would give you uh 4 a so and it give you equals -21 but it's not going to eliminate everything all right so sometimes one of the easier ways to go is just to distribute and actually see what happens so that's what I want you to do right here um if you want to plug in some numbers and sometimes you get lucky do it that's what I would try every time if there's an easy number to plug in man do it but there's not sometimes you're left with actually Distributing combining your terms and going forward so go ahead and do that now distribute combine your terms I'm going to to do it while you guys are doing it [Applause] make sure I got that a 2x- BX plus 2 CX did you get the same thing yeah collect your terms I see a couple X squs so I'm going to have A+ 2B X2 collect some x's again how I do this I always put a plus makes it easier for our signs when we Factor we'll have b + 2 c x are you guys seeing what I'm talking about there we put our plus and then we collect our signs inside of our parentheses B and 2 C lastly we have plus 4 A minus c as our constant we got those ones did did you make it that far on your own fantastic what's nice about this is when we collect our terms we have x s hey we match it up over here we've got X we match it up over here with our coefficients we've got a constant we match up with our constant so you tell me hopefully you can figure this out if I put a + 2 B how much is that equal to one yeah where are you getting that one from this is the coefficient of x s isn't it mhm this is the coefficient of x s isn't it it's got to equal so 1 equal a + 2 let's do the next one um if I put B+ 2 cative b + 2 C how much does b + 2 C have to equal here since this is the coefficient of x and this is the coefficient of x you're right now if I put 4 a - c how much ises 4 a - c half equal the reason why we use pluses here it keeps our signs correct uh that way you just look here and here and here set equal to the coefficients themselves so this has got to be -21 sure feel okay with that one so far okay now you can solve this in a variety of ways uh the best way I think I found to solve this um I would probably do a substitution I'd probably set said this one I'm going to do a lot of math quickly my head CU I don't want to spend a whole lot of time teaching you algebra okay so what I would do is I would add the C subtract add the 21 I would get C = 4 a + 21 does that make sense I would do a substitution here I'd get b + 2 * 4 a + 21 my equals 1 the idea being if I can get A's and B's I can combine it with this A's and B's and create a system of equations and that will let me solve it algebraically so do our substitution no problem we got B cool two no problem 4 a + 21 that's our c = 1 let's do a little distribution so b + 8 a + 42 = 1 are you still with me folks okay now I'm going to get my A's and B's on one side I'm going to get my con the other side because that's how this one looks I'll probably write my 8 a first cuz that's how this one looks my - B = -43 you still okay with that this is what we have now A + 2 b = 1 8 a minus B = 43 you guys should know how to do systems of equations in one of two ways either you do a substitution which would work here just fine or you do elimination which is what I'm going to do here and that's going to work just fine so if I did elimination I'd multiply this by two I multiply by two so if I multiply by two we get a + 2 b = 1 we get 16 a - 2 B = -86 have I've done that right have I done that right yes then we what do we do in this case we' add we' get 17 a this is gone equals 85 man this is kind of nice now let's solve it how much is a85 1785 over 17 what is it five five five I'm just telling what you give me what is it okay does it matter doesn't matter right I mean it matters it doesn't matter from here can you solve the rest of them yes piece of cake if a is5 solve for all Sol for whatever you want uh you can solve for C by this one by this one actually would be nice you could solve for b by this one that's what I would do first so if I plug the5 here I'd be adding that dividing by 2 B is how much sure -5 + 2 b = 1 therefore B = three so I get this one and I got this one now working over here I do this for our C I plug in ne5 there hey look at that 4 * 5 is -2020 + 21 is 1 that was relatively painless not so bad right not as easy as plugging numbers in uh but not horribly bad hey now that we have our coefficients can we rewrite our integral I know we've done a lot of algebra okay but I'm going to come right back to here so our integral x^2 - x - 21 over 2x 3r - x^2 + 8x - 4 dear goodness me equals an integral of two fractions now notice we have three three coefficients we have three constants but we don't have three fractions we have two fractions the first fraction is over what please the first fraction is over what the second fraction is over DX on the numerator of our first fraction it says that we're supposed to have only an a what goes here on the numerator of a second fraction we supposed to have a BX plus c 3x+ 1 beautiful we knew that this fraction can be broken up we we just showed it we know that a is5 hey5 2x - 1 we know that b is 3 we just showed it we know C is 1 plug those numbers in we get 3x + 1 x^2 + 4 so be okay with that one now I've got to erase this stuff do you have any questions so far on this you sure okay this very straightforward very straightforward this is going to be an Ln do you guys see it linear Ln the only difference is this is be -5 Ln absolute value 2x -1 it's going to be5 Ln absolute value 2x -1 over two do you see where the over two is going to come from it's a little U sub Right Here If U equal 2x - 1 du = 2 DX or du/ 2 = DX the over two is from right there does that make sense to you I do those in my head if you need to show your work you show your work don't get those wrong now I'm going to show that to you in a little bit this one some of you guys are struggling with Concepts like this man how in the crap am I going to do what am I going to do there think back to what fractions are made up of fractions can always be split up always now let's think it through okay think it through what would you do here basic UB or just do in your head look at this one what would you do here another that's a UB what's the derivative of an x s I don't care about the constant it's going to be an X do you guys see what I'm talking about how about that one let's think about that one okay we're going to do this over here do you guys want to finish this problem today yes okay we're it's going to take us about 3 minutes uh did you have questions on that too late okay let's just run down there I'm going to split these up because we're going this is crazy but we're going to use three different techniques on each of these three integrals so to show this accurately in mathematics you don't want to just do this all as one okay you have two different substitutions here are you following me so you're going to actually three you're going to split this up into three different pieces so integral of the first one plus integral second one plus integral the third one you could have pulled out the5 as well this integral is fairly straightforward r u = 2x -1 R du = 2dx our du/ 2 = DX therefore when you do your integral we get -5 Hales 5 Hales Ln absolute value of 2x - one and absolute value I need to show if I feel okay with that one this would be5 over U that would be5 Ln absolute value U you plug back in for your U and the DU over two gives us our five Hales so -5 Hales over U Ln U okay with that one no we're going quick but if you need refresher on that go back and look at that section online or on the video on the line okay next one don't let these things Escape you like this if you're stuck you go man I can't do that one try splitting it up then it makes a really easy integral doable for a hard integral doable for you makes it easier do a basic U sub here U = X2 + 4 d = 2 DX D over 2 = x DX there it is right there that means that we have three integral 1 over U du over 2 are we okay with that one yeah okay well that means that we're going to have three Hales Ln absolute value U so this will be plus use purple here to show that same thing plus 3es absolute Val sorry Ln absolute value of what goes in there and abute value I want to make sure you guys are golden on this stuff you guys okay with the first one five got a little substitution that's where the the over two comes from here basic substitution all basic du = 2dx d over2 = x DX this is Du over2 therefore we're going to have a three Hales that's the over two we're going to have integral of 1 U so we're having three Hales Ln absolute value U plug in back for the u u is x^2 + 4 we got our integral am I explaining this well enough for you guys okay next up you can actually do this two ways I'm going to show you a a very cool idea here that you're going to be using one idea is you understand that I could make this one over I could force this to factor as X over 2^ 2ar + 1 * 4 that would be 1/4 the integral of 1 /x +/ 2^ 2 + 1 and then you realize that's tan inverse and you go oh look at that that's tan inverse x 2 12 because you have a little use up there you can do it that way if you didn't catch that don't worry about so much I'll show you a different way hope that's right the way we'll see my constant might be up there I do it really fast here's another option this almost almost looks like a tri sub do you see it what's missing square root ignore it ignore the missing square root if you were to write it as a square root that would be the hypotenuse missing the square root did you get that you can still do that's a that's a tangent you can still do the two missing sides do you follow that if you do the two missing sides this would give you the X this would give you the two you can still do a substitution tan thet = X2 so who cares if it doesn't have the square root you can still do this no problem this is X this is 2 therefore this is square root X2 + 4 okay then X = tan th * 2 DX would equal 2^ 2 thet D Theta our integral would equal 1 over 2 tan Thea 2 + 4 our DX would equal 2^ 2 D thet 2^ 2 thet D Theta I know I just went really fast on this are you are you following that one you sure the triangle is the hardest part right then we do hey uh tan the X2 no problem x = 2 tan Theta DX = 2 c 2 D Theta make our substitution 1/ 2 tan thet 2 + 4 DX is 2 D that means that our integral becomes 4 tan^ 2 + 4 2^ S Theta D Theta Factor the four out if I factor the four notice it's even easier there's no square root here if we Factor the four we get 2^ 2 thet D Theta over 4 tan^ 2 + 1 do we follow that yeah hey look at that do you see 1/2 told you it was a 1/2 that's because of those constants hey2 integral hey how much is this so we're going to have secant s Theta over SEC s Theta that's equal to 12 integral oh my gosh this is square thet right this is square Theta right this is 1 12 square of what D can you integrate one so this is 12 Theta oh goodness gracious here's the whole banana is that even a term is that a thing you just made it a thing it's a thing whatever if tan Theta = x 2 this is if and only if Theta = tan oh my goodness this is where all your inverse integrals came from boah you just it then this is the same thing as 12 T = X2 correct = tan inverse of x 2 so 12 tan inverse x 2 I believe I had that on the board just a little while ago yeah so if you know how to factor that let's see you could do it with just uh your inverse trig function as far as your integral let go so one last little piece we're going to add this up here don't forget this is our first part we have plus 12 10 inverse X over 2 plus C now my question is did You Understand it yes somewh so this one Ln this one substitution then Ln this one you can do it two ways you can draw the triangle this still works don't even have to worry about the square root of okay just make the triangle accordingly or you could have made this factor out the four make it Factor the four you'd get an X2 2 + 1 and then a 1/4 outside do a little substitution for x over2 and you have an inverse uh tangent and that's the idea should okay with this one okay so before we get on to our last thankfully our last example of partial fractions uh I covered an example that had this little piece in it and I want to go over this a little bit more slowly uh on how you there's two ways to actually do this how you can go about doing this problem in one of two different ways now the first way the first way is an idea that we get from trigonometric substitution it's well you know what that looks almost like a triangle almost like one one hypotenuse of a right triangle you can actually do that so you could make a right triangle out of this and the way you can think about it is well if this were to have a square root around it like that this would be the hypotenuse is that does that make sense to you so it would be like this if that were the hypotenuse well the other two Dimensions here are the sides are the legs well we would have x and x and what two X and two where would the X go uh this one yeah because what what do we want to do here is make up our tangent relationship so we'd have X we'd have 2 and we'd have tan Theta = x/ 2 or x = 2 tan Theta and then of course we take our derivative we have DX = 2^ 2 Theta D Theta you guys okay with that so far mhm if you really think about it you can do this lots of times let's let's consider this one more time if you had just 1/x^2 + 4 someone made a comment earlier well maybe we can manipulate this a little bit so it's easier to see check it out if I have X do you understand that it's almost the same thing it's not the same thing it's almost the same thing as uh the square root of x squared mhm that's this is almost true uh it's not true because we'd Square it so our negative X's don't really work that way it's really the um it's really an absolute value type of idea but we can use it for here especially since we have both positive we don't have to worry about that there's no way we can get a negative out of this anyway so it's going to be positive no matter what does that make sense to you so whether X is positive or negative we get a positive out of it we would have to worry about that scenario so in our case we' say all right well if you want to make this a little bit more understandable about why this can fit a right triangle here it is why this can fit a right triangle is that we could make this the square < TK of x^2 + 4 squar now for those of you who didn't see it before do you guys see what I'm talking about that is that I mean that now that that is a hypotenuse right there it just now we have a squared do you follow me you can do that no problem we'd have our X we'd have our two we'd have hey that's my hypot now either way you go about doing this you're going to get the same thing because when we plug this in when we do our actual substitution well we've got one I'll leave it this way just so you see what I'm talking about we'd have one we'd have something being squared you with me inside here we'd have a square root we would have 2 tan Theta 2 + 4 and then we'd have our DX becomes 2^ 2 D thet you guys get me so far now look what happens with the square root and the square we didn't have to do this me personally I would have gone straight to my triangle from right here I wouldn't I wouldn't have needed that because I'm used to it but if you need this you go okay well this is the same thing as something with a square root squared yeah that's true that will allow you to see the triangle a little bit more easily let you set up this this relationship on our triangle let you find tan th = X2 no big deal but now watch it what happens when you square a square root take it away it goes right back to what you had does that make sense so you really didn't need to do it but you can do it if it helps you see it so in either case what we end up getting and I know that I did this earlier in class but uh we'll we'll do it again we get two secant s thet D Theta over what happens here is we're going to get I'm going to do a lot of math in my head right now just so you hopefully you're with me here uh the square and the square root are gone you follow I'd pull out the four I take a square root of four I'm going to get two I'd have a square root I'm sorry we wouldn't have a square root anymore the square Root's gone I made a mistake uh this is why I don't like to do the square root because it's it's gone now so maybe I can write this and you guys can follow me from here uh we' pull out the four and we'd have sec s Theta shoot I'm going too fast for my own good aren't I there we go that's gone we pull the four up of course we Square the two we Square the tangent pull the four up after this we'd have a 1/2 we'd have a secant squ Theta this becomes see 2 D this is 12 the integral of again I'm going too fast I'm doing the integrals in my head 1 D Theta don't even need the one what's the integral of I I went fast are you guys okay with getting down that far what's the integral of one yeah in this case is Theta so 12 Theta can I leave it in terms of theta no but here it is uh if tan thet = X 2 this happens if and only IFA = tan inverse of x 2 do you guys buy of that one tan X2 hey tan inverse of X2 so what we get out of this substitution is that our integral is 12 tan inverse x 2 + C this would be the long way of doing things but it is a way show fansy feel okay with the a way of do it you could do a trig sub just by looking here you can make it fit more of the trig sub idea or you could do this here's way number two way number two is to try to fit this to an integration table uh to try to fit this into integration table just the way it is and the way it is would be well if I can fit this to U ^2 + 1 du the integral of 1 u^2 + 1 du is tan inverse of U plus C of course well here's another idea then instead of going through the whole trig some idea well maybe we just think of instead of 1x^2 + 4 DX we force this thing we force this thing to factor out four here so we could say okay well if I'm trying to make this a one I've got to factor out a four you get me then I'd have 4 and i' end up getting in inside my bracket x^2 over 4 + one DX do you guys all the algebra on that if you don't just distribute right now and you'll see that this goes to X2 and this goes to + 4 you follow then what I need to do to fit this for I need to make this as something squared so x^2 4 no no no I'm going to pull the 1/4 out I would have 1 over X over 2^ 2 + 1 does that make sense to you so instead of X2 over no no let's think of this something squared let's do X over 2 2 you'll notice that 1/4 is outside out front this becomes X over 2 2 that's still x^2 over 4 and then the + one so far so good now you do just a basic U substitution basic so the u = x/ 2 du = 12 DX 2 du = DX and what we end up getting is 1/4 the integral 1 over what's the X over2 become U yeah u^2 + 1 and then we'd have 2D so instead of DX we get our 2D tell me next thing I'm going to do pull out the two pull out the two so I'd get 12 1/4 and two the integral of 1 u^2 + 1 d u hey do I know what the integral of U S 1 U ^2 + 1 is tan inverse U Tan inverse of U so this becomes 12 tan inverse of U how much is u plus c ends up being exactly the same thing so if you ever see and you are going to get this a lot uh listen you're going to get this a lot one of these things where you have 1x^2 + 4 or + 9 or + 1 if you see that how many ways can you go about doing it and either way is is fine U if you want the quick way and you want to do just a little substitution do this if you like the triangle method do this do do I care I don't care so as long as you can do one of these ways i' I'd say do both of them sometimes this is going to be nicer because if I do this like that you can still do it here you can't if I do this this is not this no don't do that so then you have to do something like along these lines so feel okay with this one okay now that was a little bit slower so but I just want to give you a heads up on what you can and can't do with this problem did that make did explain it well enough for you guys to understand it okay can we go on to our last example yes last one let's do it I'm glad you said yes I was going to anyway but now that I have your approval uh better by the way were there any questions on this uh too late we've done this stuff earlier in chapter 6 right uh we did this stuff earlier in Chapter 7 uh as far as the the trig sub um we also did yeah we've done we done all sorts of stuff in chapter 7 so somewhere along the lines we did this yes you guys got plenty of paper today right paper I hope you have a notebook full this is going to take a few pages of paper for you start a new page wait maybe start a new page I I'm going to need at least two of these board for this so heads up this going to take at least a gig or two of video at least probably probably two gigs this example two gig it's this it's this much see this and this one that's comp to don't worry you're going to know how to do all of it it's not hard it just takes a lot ofs yeah a lot of steps no long division because I'm a nice guy today see I like long okay so uh let's take a look at our example here let's see what exactly is going on remember that we have we have had three cases so far haven't we yes our first case was the easiest one you get a lot of LNS it's just it's it's linear linear factors the denominator is all linear factors like x + 1 2x - 3 those are linear then next case after that case two was you have linear but then you might have repeated linear and remember building up on the repeated linear you do for every Power until you reach the highest power uh so a over whatever B over whatever C over whatever you build that up now when we got to quadratics irreducible quadratics we no longer had just a constant numerator we had one it's did I tell you this it's always 1 de lower than what your your factor is so for linear we have constants for quadratics we have linears that's what our numerators are well this last case is not just Linear by the way can you tell me what the linear factor is here whatever that is turn it off now uh can you tell me what the linear factor is yeah that's linear we're going to have a overx right now you with me so we don't just neglect our previous knowledge of hey what do you do with linear you're you're kind of building on them so you can have more than one case in each example so linear sure now do we have any irreducible quadratics up here yeah that's an irreducible can you factor that no that's irreducible but we also have it repeated to a power and this is our case 4 case four is repeated quadratics so we had linear then we had repeated linears then we had IR reducible quadratics now we have repeated irreducible quadratics so this is our case four you forgot the DX I wasn't done yet so now that we're ready to go on our Temple uh let's see what what happens when we do this now before we go before we go and do this I want to give you an example of that's where're definitely not going to go through this whole thing all right I want to see if you understand how to build your partial fractions from this so little side step okay let's say that I had not even an integral just this thing right here if I gave you that would you know how to write the partial fractions to it this has every case that I can imagine here so I think it's kind of nice for us to go through this just so you see what's actually going on are you you guys with me on that one yeah first thing you check for is can you factor your denom any more can I factor this anymore this Factor not distribute vector vector no Vector no so these are all non-factorable do you believe me yes okay so they're completely factored now when we go through this you need to be good at identifying what linear factors are what repeated linear factors are what irreducible quadratics are and what uh repeated irreducible quadratics are the same method we use for repeated linear is the same thing we're going to do for repeated irreducible quadratics same basic idea so when we go through this oh yeah you know what the next thing we talked about you got to check the degree so how in the world do you check the degree here what's the degree of the numerator what's the degree of the denominator three lot more than a lot more than that a lot more because degree is after you've distributed everything right so let's start here you you'd get an X to 4th somewhere here wouldn't you and you get an x to the 6 then you get another x s so you have x to the 8 x to the 9th basically you have an X something X you have an X to 9th somewhere up here do you follow so naturally our degree here is less than the degree on a numerator so degree of denominator is did I say that backwards degree of numerator is less than degree of denominator and that's what we're looking for thank goodness because if it wasn't what would we have to do here comine it you have to distribute it and then do long division with it and then re the factoring would be crazy again after that but anyway this would be the idea should be okay with the the idea now let's see if you're good at telling me how many fractions we're going to get don't say that loud I want you to count them up how many fractions you're going to get okay don't say that loud everyone do this how many fractions are we going to get have you counted letters or fractions fractions how many fractions we're going to get let's see do you remember what to do with with our our factors here let's see what's the first one going to be and then I'm going to have another one with x- one oh so with repeated remember this when they're by themselves no problem when they're repeated you put the first Power you put the first Power correctly it's okay put the first Power then you put x- until you build up to the greatest power here so here we'd have X we have X - 1 we have X - 1 s that's what repeated linear was do you remember that let's just work on the all the fractions right now then we'll fill out the numerators what's next X you go to your next one so our repeated our quadratics so x^2 + 1 that one's not repeated so I'm good to go after that what x2+ x + 1 the same thing we did with our repeated linear so here we had x - one then we had X - 1 2 you take every Power up to the largest power so here x no problem X - 1 s well you got to have an X - 1 then you got to have an X - 1 2 x + x^2 + 1 no problem that's not two a power so we just have one of those factors here this is repeated so I have x^2 + x + 1 but then I'm going to have another one cuz it's repeated you have to go to power that you have and X2 + x + 1 s 1 2 3 4 5 6 those people said six you're right on the money if you didn't say six do you understand why we get six now you sure okay so we got this hey repeated you're going to have two of these that's what it says two one two of these so 1 2 3 4 5 six just count the powers up that should be how many fractions you actually get here so far so good okay especially if I would have some like this a lot of people screw this up a lot of people do this and they do that is that the appropriate thing to do you'd have an X and then you'd have an X squ so if you count the powers 1 2 3 4 five six seven this would give you those seven fractions that you should have on this example you okay with that one now let's go ahead I'm going to erase that again let's figure out what we should have what's the first letter we would start with it's linear next one good how about C this would be C yes that's still C because it's repeated linear every time we get a quadratic we have a power a degree less so power one power one this is repeat linear counts towards linear so we have a c we have DX plus e we have quadratic h a b c d e f g h h h fantastic that be the idea this is the idea show feel okay with this one this is why we're not doing this because this is crazy but you could if you really wanted to you could find your common denominator and you could figure out your a b c d e f g hi I Elemental P whatever you get out of there and you can do your partial fractions there's an easier way there's no easier way this is it this is the partial fraction reduction for this our decomposition as we we say now fortunately for us this one should be substantially easier than this one we have a lot less fractions to deal with what I want to know is does this actually makes sense to you guys so we count our powers make sure you have that appropriate number of fractions make sure that you don't do silly things like put a BX plus C here don't do silly things like for forget to do the X Plus don't forget the X's it's always got to be one less degree than whatever power that is this counts as linear you don't need a CX plus uh D here but for every subsequent one where we have our irreducible quadratics you definitely do need that any last minute question before we get on to our actual example okay the rest of this thing is going to take us a while so I'm going to erase this because I need the room but let's go back to this one so if we're looking at this then what we know is that XB - 2x^2 + 3x + 2 over x * x^2 + 1^ SAR can be reduced into some partial fractions or decomposing some partial fractions question is the degree of the numerator less than the degree of the denominator yes yeah this counts as X 4th here's X 5th that's more than x 3r that's great so we don't need to do long division or anything like that this is nice because that would be very hard to do with this problem we don't want to we don't want to do that we don't have to redistribute refactor okay can you tell me actually you know what why don't you do it why don't you write out the fractions that you're supposed to have here I think you guys are all at that level go forward I know there's at least one how many in total are we going to have three power one one two three yep you're right can you tell me what the denominators will be tell me what the denominators will be first what is it second denominator perfect last one fantastic that's exactly right show fans you get the denominator perfect good so repeated quadratics work just like repeated linears you just put the factors until you reach the largest power so here we have x to the 1 no big deal we have x^2 + 1 to the second well we need our first power we need our second power now let's fill the numerators out make sure we got those right what's the first thing we're going to write here is this going to have X's up here it's quadratic it's going to be BX plus C this one it's also quadratic did you get that yes does it make sense to get that we have linear should just be in a one power less or 1 de less quadratic should be 1 de less exus quadratic should be 1 de less still have an X joance if you okay with with this one are you sure you positive this is Big Time right if you don't get this are you going to get your problem right no no that's an issue okay we got to make sure this is this is perfect now moving on what's the next thing we do after we figure out how our rational expression is going to be decomposed in partial fractions what are we going to do find common denom let's find our common denominator why don't you go ahead and do it see if you can do it I'll do it up here in just a second so I'm only give you a little bit of time did you get it back there so remember what we do we look here we look here we multiply by the missing factors just like any other time in the world you would ever find a common denominator just like in algebra it is algebra this is all algebra okay I know I've said it about 50 times so far but your idea is to find a denominator between here and here if you can do that then if the denominators are the same your numerators must also be equal therefore when we multiply by the missing factors we get that common denominator automatically that's why we don't write these denominators here so we're going to have numerator equal to our new numerator um what I do I look here and I look here at each individual fraction I just multiply by what's missing so I know I'm going to have a and the thing that's missing between here and here is my X2 + 1 squ you guys follow me on that one between here and here well be careful I know some of you guys hate parentheses I don't know why you hate them they're friendly when you have BX plus C you got to have parenthesis there you will be Distributing so a * well I'm missing this whole x^2 + 1 2 got it BX plus C okay I'm missing what am I missing between here and here what's missing good I am missing X for sure and then one I like how you said that one factor of x^2 + 1 let's make sure I don't have the X so I got that now I'm missing oh I'm missing the square so I need one more factor that X2 + 1 if you multiply this times this it should give you this if you multiply this times this it should give you this that's how this stuff works so you're just multiply by the missing factors you guys okay with that so far and lastly we've got a well we have a DX plus e again in parenthesis so here we were missing this guy here we were missing X and one factor this guy here we're missing what so it's just got to be DX plus e * X show P feel okay with that perfect now I think I mentioned this earlier when you have these quadratic factors it's not as easy as when you have the linears with the linear was real nice because you can plug in numbers a lot of the times and eliminate entire terms like High sections of this you can't really do that all that well here there's there's one number I'd probably plug in if I wanted to just really quickly I'd plug in probably zero um if you plug in zero this whole thing's gone this whole thing's gone because X's would be zero here this would be 1 1 s is a if I plug in zero I get two right off the bat I know that a is two does that make sense to you so I probably do that first so if I do xals 0 I know that two so 0 0 0 here's two here's 0 + 1 is 1 1 2 is 1 a * 1 is a a = 2 all this stuff would go to zero 0 * everything would be 0 0 * everything would be zero so right now I know a is two so f beate with that logic if you didn't do that right away it's going to be very apparent to you later anyway so it's really not that big of a deal what do we do with the rest of this junk you distribute all of it no here's here's the problem if you if you're like well wait a minute why can't we just plug in okay tell you what uh give me a number here that you can plug in the makx is zero I'll give you a million dollars if you don't use complex dang it I yay I win yeah we're not talking about complex analysis are we class is horrible yet yet that's in upper that's later okay so no can you plug anything to make this zero no no can you plug in anything to make this I don't know because you didn't know what D and are so no the only thing we could plug in to help us here was Zero we're done with that so you're left with distribute you can distribute it distribute It Go For It distribute it and hurry because we're run out of time so I'm going to leave this off to the side here okay I know a is two that that's actually going to help us a lot that's good oh my goodness wow uh this will be fun you get to double check my word too so sometimes I make mistakes just like you guys I hope I don't you like distribute all everything like all of it you got to use you got to use P what about just the first one are we good x 4 + 2x^2 + 1 then a did you get the first thing like this too okay I know it's going to be a plus so let's see did you get that for the second one same thing yeah did you I want make sure I'm right too so don't leave me hang in here if you got something different and I did it wrong you let me know that's what I got because of the X I got that too man okay this one should be easy okay all right good got it did we get that that's all distributed you of course might take a little bit more time and do this and make sure that you're actually right because it makes no sense to do this and get it wrong otherwise your problem your smoke you spend 30 more minutes on this and get the wrong answer that sucks so make sure this is absolutely correct what do you do now combine kind of combine like terms you factor out the the like terms here so we look for our like terms and we do X Cub - 2x^2 + 3x + 2 no problem and then we collect them so I like to Circle them I know that that's kind of what well why are we circling them when we're in calculus 2 but I don't like to forget any I don't like to lose them so I Circle my like terms here like this one and this one um please remember that you're not factoring out the constants with your variable you're literally factoring out just your variable so if you had a two here and a two here you leave it with the A and the B because that's going to be a system of equations all I'm looking to have you guys do is do this a plus b do all the constants a and b r constants here and then factor out the X for does that make sense to you and we keep on going so I'm going to cross those out I don't want to ever make the mistake of writing it twice or forgetting one of them after that I'm going to look for any of the cubes do you see any cubes trust me on this you're going to love it when there's only one of them seriously you'll see why in a second I wrote C I thought c i i i don't know why it's a three man if I write a c when I think of three I get poed C3 P whatever come on that was good okay so I'm such a dor So fourth's Gone Cube's gone I get a 2B or not 2B C3PO I all I need is R2 and a D2 and we're we're good I'll start using RS next time you just need to make one with that many fraction no I don't want to do that okay our squares so with our squares I've got notice what I'm going to do I'm not pulling out the two I'm going to leave the two with the a so a 2 a and then a b and then a d shouldn't it be minus two I don't think so it's a positive oh I'm sorry I'm sorry I don't see any negatives up here so we're we're kind of fortunate as far I negative I'm sorry my mistake yeah something on that doesn't it anyway squ C plus e so we got our fourths we got our Cub we got our squares we got a 2 A plus b plus d and then X2 now we're going to look for our X's I've got that c and my e so plus C plus e x that's nice and then lastly we have our don't forget that a that plus it at the very end oh goodness okay what I want is show up pant if you're okay on the algebra of it is it going to take you some time but most of this is kind of algebra when we get down to the trick it goes very fast and that's nice all you're going to know how to do all the trig and all the and all the integrals no problem there will be trig in a lot of this by the way trick Subs uh or there's going to be inverse trick function like a tan inverse or something because when we get down to this guy and this guy you're going to be splitting that up you'll have constants over x^2 + 1 you're going to get that so be prepared for it that's why we covered all the previous sections now a lot of these are going to be nice and easy here's what I can show you do you know that your coefficients have to match up so for instance when I'm looking at this I'm looking here my only constant is a you got it my only constant over here is therefore a must equal we already knew that but do you see how this really didn't help us all that much it gives it to just right here anyway so let's list them all out over here I know that a is two so we got our a let's keep on going what's another easy one that you see I would look for C I look for all the individual ones look at the C I've got CX to the 3 you with me CX to the 3r look at my X the 3 uh term over there what's the coefficient of x the 3 therefore if I have X the 3 here and this is my only X the 3 how much does c have to equal the coefficients must be equal so coefficient here is C coefficient here is one therefore C equals 1 this was kind of nice right not that hard to do no no series systems of equations it looks like it's going to be ridiculous ends up being really easy you guys okay with that one then I start looking for stuff that's going to be easier after I come up these these basic ones so a got two c I got one if I see c and e well now I can figure out e really easily can you tell me what C plus e has to equal C plus e let's see if you could get this C plus e has to equal what sure C plus e x here's my X coefficient is 3 coefficient is C plus e therefore C plus e has to equal 3 okay if C + e equal 3 can you tell me how much E equals good C is 1 so now we're starting to use some of these basic substitutions C is 1 + e = 3 therefore e = two so I got a is two I got C is one I've got e is two can you figure out the rest of them from here yeah easily let's look at uh oh let's look at this one some of you guys aren't used to this this idea I've got a plus b x 4th correct wait a minute crap has to Beal to Z how many X the 4S do I have zero none so if I have a plus b x 4th and I don't even have an X 4th a plus b equals zero coefficients have to match the coefficient of x 4th would be 0 so 0 = A + B how much is a again two so 2 = b b = -2 hey we're almost done one last one I left the longest one for last not first because I don't I wouldn't know how to do it right I left this one for last so I'm doing easy to hard how much is 2 A + B + d equal to why don't you tell me 2 a perfect so X2 X2 coefficient is -2 coefficient here is this whole thing now we're just plugging in the numbers that we already know I know that a is 2 so 2 * 2 plus how much is B how much is D don't know yet so we're plugging in what we know we knew a was 2 2 * 2 we knew B was -2 so plus -2 then we just work it out simple algebra 4 - 2 gives you two how much is D have we found them all a b CDE e we got a B CDE e hey we got them all now let's go ahead and let's write out what these fractions are going to be so can you go ahead and do that for me please so write out what this integral changes into you should have the same number of fractions your denominator should be the same your numerator should be whatever coefficients you had whether it's a constant or whether it's a coefficient on X what's our first fraction be 2 next [Music] fraction oh okay so we want to make sure our signs are correct huh all right that's probably good idea so B is -2 so we're going to have -2X our c is 1 so a a was easy it's two -2x + 1 got it and our last one let's do DX plus C What's d so it's going to be -4x plus two plus two okay quick your hands feel okay with that one cool now we got to kind of move so I got to erase this you know I'll do one more step and I'll erase all this stuff whenever you get these quadratics or linear quadratics unless it works with a substitution which is not going to happen a lot okay because of that constant is not going to happen um so what we're going to to do here because if it did you'd have an X here uh you're not going to do that otherwise it would have been reducible so it's not going to happen what you do here split the fractions you got to split them up so our one two three fractions is going to change to this 1 2 3 4 five fractions you follow do not change your denominators ever so we have 2X here's what I'm going to do please watch carefully I'm going to have notice how I didn't bring down the minus because I have changeed it sign I don't want to do that I'm going to have - 2x over x^2 + 1 so I can leave this plus and have + 1 over x^2 + 1 I'm going to leave this minus and do - 4x over x^2 + 1 2 and then I'm going to have + 2 x^2 + 1 SAR DX so be okay with that one are you sure so we're splitting it up we got no problem split it -2X X2 + 1 no big deal uh we got plus 1x2 + 1 we get - 4x X2 + 1 2 + 2 notice how my denominators don't change I'm not changing that I can't split those okay but the num writers yeah we can now I'm going to do this kind of an interesting way I'm going to rewrite this whole thing I'm going to write this on the top of my paper and do each one right under it you guys with me so I'm going to have a lot of space here but I want to make sure you're seeing that I'm doing each of these integral rules separately you follow okay so keep this in mind I'm going to erase everything else so any other questions before we uh continue some of these are going to go very quickly some of these are going to take a little more time there's nothing I haven't taught you how to do so what I'm probably going to do is show you how to set the integral up and then let you go for it I'll probably write it very fast up here with answer is uh but you you guys at this point should know how to do all of these things so let's see by the way can I can I pull out some constants here and you guys be okay with it yeah so this changes to 2 * the integral of 1x you got it yeah DX I'm going to split up everything this is going to be minus 2times integral you can even leave the two because of our substitution we're about to do X x^2 + 1 DX we're going to have + 1 integral of 1 over X2 + 1 DX we'll have -4 you know what I need more space for this one oh that should be that one + 1^ 2 DX and then lastly we're going to have a + 2 * the integral of 1 x^2 + 1 sared DX oh my goodness that's a lot let's make sure we're okay with it we pull the two out we got 1X DX we pulled the -2 or the minus 2 out we separate our integrals we got xx2 + 1 DX this one was great just integral of 1x2 + 1 DX minus we pulled the four out we got xx2 + 1ty S DX pull the two out we got 1x2 + 1^2 do ex your pant be okay with that one oh my goodness now some of these are going to be very easy I'm going to go through quickly other ones I'll show you specifically this one and this one are the ones you're worried about a little bit the rest of them are going to be piece of cake so let's look at our cake can you do this integral 2 Ln absolute value of x no problem that's an easy one because we have a definition of integral of 1x DX is absolute Ln absolute value of x what would you all use for this just do a use sub if you got X so it's basically either going to be Ln a u sub or it's going to be a tree that's it so with this stuff we're going to do well u u = x^2 + 1 d = 2x DX du/ 2 = x DX so when we go for that we have integral of notice we have X DX this becomes our D over 2 so 1 / U du over 2 two keep in mind we have a minus two out front twos are gone we have minus Ln absolute value x^2 + 1 look I did that one really fast but I want to make sure you guys are okay with it are you okay with it you sure so this was you no problem basic substitution X DX is Du right over two right here two with the 1/2 gone integral of 1 U is Ln absolute value U plug the U Back In I know I'm going fast but you guys should be able to follow that or at least do it on your own you okay with that one yeah okay Moving On by the way are the absolute values pertinent here no you would write them and then you can't eliminate them if you want to because X2 + 1 can't be negative now this one this is an interesting one this one you either draw a triangle for or you understand that the integral of 1x2 + 1 is tangent inverse of X and that's very basic this right here is tan inverse of x no substitution no nothing that's literally in remember doing your integrals the first thing you check for is check for your integration table that's right there I'm check for it that's tan inverse you'd waste a whole lot of time if you were to draw your triangle it's kind of fun I like it uh but it takes a long time to actually do that right okay next one what would you do here same exact thing it be a Uub so U would = x^2 + 1 du would = 2x DX du/ 2 = x DX here's our X DX right here so this would be our -4 we'd have an integral we'd have 1 over U2 D over 2 here's the big thing I want you to notice check it out notice how this was our u in here correct so we have 1 over u^2 do you guys see where the U S com from is this going to be an Ln no this right here is our -4 sorry uh what should should be up there I mean two -2 this would be U to the -2 du we bring that up this is not always an Ln okay this one's not so -2 u 1 over1 or we get 2 over U if I've done that right hopefully I did that right so what that means look at what I did here okay I took the sign with it I took my minus 4 I changed it to A4 we did the whole thing it changed to positive two so I'm going to have a plus 2 over U what's our U X+ one that's the idea should can be located with with that one okay now where are we at now last one last one last one last one is not in your basic integration table we talked about this earlier the opening of our class this is one where you'd have to draw your triangle for so you can think of it think of this as your y as y hypotenuse x² + one I going do the whole class like that X2 + 1 and we got this uh leg over here x and this is if we got that thing then we're going to be using a tangent I'm not really going to do that that'll be fun though huh you guys get me on the triangle yeah that's got to be hypotenuse right if it is yeah we're kind of putting that square root up there we know we can we just change this to an X 4th and then that would be a square root does that make sense to you no you show that if you want to I'm going to kind of s side step that idea think just think about it think if this is part of a triangle I put a square root around it it's a hypotenuse then we have X and one because I'm trying to make tangent here it's either tangent or secant or sign not going to cover again we already did equals x well look at that DX thenal D okay so far can we finish this example up yes okay we're very very close what that means is that our integral here becomes two integral of 1 over tan^ 2 th + 1 2ar * SEC 2 Theta D Theta so this is one okay cool this was tan tangent 2 + 1 whole thing squar DX is see 2 D th show feel okay with that so far now what do we do so we're going to simplify yeah simple this is going to be D Theta I'm going to do this quickly this right here is SEC squ correct yes to the second power is to 4th still right so far that means that this is two 1^ 2 D th that becomes 2 cosine 2 D Theta see where the cosine squar is coming from yeah hey do we know how to do cosine Square [Music] 2 1 + cosine 2et D these are we get I'm just going to do the integral right here this integral therefore Isa plus sin 2 / 2 we keep on going remember that with your triangles I know you've seen this before you can't have a 2 Theta you'd have to make this that 2 sin Theta cosine Theta so we geta plus 2 sin Theta cine Theta over 2 twos are gone now we get to change everything back again so I'm going to do that over here once I get this if Theta sorry Tan = x Thena = tan inverse X got that one can you do do sign sign is opposite so that would be X over < TK X2 + 1 time oh cosine look at cosine cosine is 1 overun x^2 + 1 so from here this is all trig stuff it should go fast for you guys you should know it this is hey 12 1 plus cosine 2 2 th no big deal twos are gone we have integral of 1 is Theta integral of cosine 2 is sin 2 2 that's a basic little use of sin 2 no good 2 sin thet cosine thet so far so good awesome well then we have twos are gone Theta is tan inverse of x no big deal sin Theta cosine Theta multiply s cosine if you multiply your square roots are going to be gone this becomes tan inverse x + x over Square no more square root x^2 + 1 you guys see where the X over X2 + 1 come from you're multiplying here so then we're going to do plus tan inverse x + x over < TK x^2 + 1 lastly the only thing we do is combine some like terms here these two things you can combine oh yeah you know what you're right I'm sorry combine some like terms so we have 2 Ln absolute value x - Ln absolute value x^2 + 1 + 2 tan inverse of x + x + 2 over x^2 + 1 like term like term like term like term done 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 7.6:  Improper Integrals
so improper integrals my goodness what in the world does this even mean well typically what we need for integrals to work so normally for any sort of definite integral from Like A to B of some function what has to happen for this to exist for us before right now for this to exist and let not have any problems with it f ofx must be bounded and finite on the interval A to B that had to happen what that means is that if I give you some curve right I say remember what an integral means what's a different integral actually mean for us the area good area under a curve between here and here basically it says if I want to find the area under a curve of this curve from these two between these two numbers our curve can't do weird things like between here and here go up forever well that doesn't really make a lot of sense or it can't go up like this forever and have an ASM toote or the there can't be holes or weird things that happen uh basically it says it's got to be bounded doesn't go up or down forever it's got to be finite can't continue on in One Direction forever so basically it's got to stop it's got to start it's got to stop and it can't do crazy things in the middle that's really what this this sort of thing means that do you guys understand the idea of bounded it has upper limit has a lower limit uh it has right side limit has left side limit A and B so basically anything that's not like this is called an improper integral we're going to study what those scenarios are how in the world we're going to deal with them so now we're going to talk about two basic scenarios so here in section 7.6 we talk about these two cases case one case one happens well suppose if you had an integral you had some curve here's our curve our curve goes like this forever and I say I want you to find the area into the curve from a to and I don't give you a stopping point if I did this check it out if I said A to B from A to B this would be fine we'd have a curve that's bounded above and bounded below above by the curve below by the x-axis we have a starting point we have an ending point that's what this would say it's bounded and it's finite that would be cool does that make sense but if I say no no no now what I want you to do is take this function f ofx and I want you to find the area under the curve from a to infinity and beyond just joking uh forever and ever can we do it well the problem is the answer is yes we can I'm going to show you how to do that the problem is this is no this no longer falls into this it's boundage sure it is do you guys see what I'm talking about being bounded it doesn't go above a certain number it doesn't go below a certain number it's going to be asmed to the xaxis as X approaches positive Infinity but it's not finite it starts at a no problem but it doesn't end so it it fails these conditions of being a normal definite integral that's what makes it this idea of an impr an improper integral do you guys get the idea of an improper integral it's not finite it's going forever and likewise I could go to negative Infinity if I wanted to so I could go this way but this case is going to cover both them or case number two case number two so case one was the interval is infinite case number two happens like this suppose you have some function this is just for an example here and I see here's my function f ofx and I asked the question hey uh can you find me the area under the curve from A to B can you find the integral basically of this function from A to B can you do it no well see what happens here um is the interval finite yeah interval starts at a interval stops at B that's cool it's a finite interval does that make sense to you is the function bounded is the function between two actual numbers that no we have a top bound top bound would be whatever whatever that number is but the bottom bound it does not exist this function goes to negative Infinity on the y- axis that's that's an issue right here so case one is well if the interval is infinite we have a situation it's not a proper integral if the function's not bounded so here f ofx is not bounded that's our other case for an improper integral so again we got this idea of a definite integral it works when A and B are finite numbers so when we go from one spot to another we have a starting spot we got an ending spot it works when f ofx is bounded this doesn't go up forever it doesn't go down forever within this range okay so it it can be a polinomial for sure which does either go to positive infinity or negative Infinity it's not ASM totic at all but within the range between this interval A and B the function has to be bounded did you guys got that the interval has to be finite no problem that means that's what we're talking about for definite integral if we don't have one of those cases so in other in other words if the interval is not finite if it's infinite goes to positive infinity or negative infinity or both of them you can do both in both directions that's one case where we we don't satisfy these conditions hence it's called an improper integral it's not the way we want it or we have another case where f ofx is not bounded within that interval so so we say hey here's our interval but the function goes positive infinity or negative Infinity within the interval basically we've got an infinite discontinuity here does that make sense not a removable discontinuity that would be different it would be still be bounded but if we have an infinite a removable discount did you guys remember what those are those are just holes right those are fine but if we have an infinite discontinuity that's an issue where the functions going into positive infinity or negative Infinity hence you have an ASM toote somewhere on on the interval that's an improper integral so again two cases interval is infinite or the function is infinite it's unbaled soents be okay with our two cases now let's talk about how to deal with these with an example we're going to talk about the first case first we'll talk about for infinite intervals for infinite intervals let's do it with an example see if you understand what I'm talking about here let's take the uh let's take the example of the integral from one to Infinity oh that already looks new doesn't it that's something we haven't ever seen before probably unless you had this class before you've never seen this before of one/ X2 DX now of course this the first time we're going through this so I'm going to really teach it to you try to make you understand what's Happening Here the first thing we look for and really you haven't ever had to look for this before um in your in your integrals but now we're going to because we're trying to do different integral right well it has to be defined on this entire this entire interval so let's check it out what's a number that would not work or would be undefined in this problem zero zero would be an issue so so am I Crossing zero on this interval no okay so we don't have this situation but check this out if I wanted to go from -1 to Infinity do you see how I'd cross over a point where I'd be undefined basically I'd cross over an ASM toote they'd go like this at x equals z does that make sense that would be this case we'd have some sort of a infinite discontinuity at that point at at X would equal zero that'd be an issue that would be case number two does that make sense to you now we don't have that we're lucky we go okay no no no let's just do positive one for this for this to work well no problem it's got to be defined on this interval it is is defined everywhere from one to Infinity now' you have you understand that we're good we don't have this situation on this interval because well we missed the one point that's bad for us we missed the zero now let's check out the other thing let's check out the interval itself is the interval itself finite no finite means it starts and it stops is it finite no it starts at one where does it end it don't end well that's an issue for us so which case are we are we in right now are we in case one case twoe one case one so for an internate interval we're going to think about this a little differently say you know what let's consider this so let's consider not Infinity because that's really hard to think about okay we don't want to think about Infinity right now let's just call it B so 1 two I don't know some m b of 1 x^2 DX where B is just some number that's bigger than one so notice something I'm not saying B smaller than one because this interval starts at remember how uh intervals work for integrals starts at the small one goes to the big one so let's consider this to be the integral from 1 to B where B is simply some number bigger than one basically bigger than where we're starting at well if that's the case here's our picture our picture if you know what the graph of 1x2 looks like it looks like this from both sides now I don't have to worry about this to worry about this side because I'm going from one to Infinity our graph basically looks like this where we're starting at one now here's the little idea the idea is it's going to be really hard for us to legitimately go from one to Infinity because how can you actually plug in Infinity for a definite integral you guys didn't see the problem you can't really plug in Infinity you can't do it which we're we're going to cheat a little bit we're going to say no no no let's not go to Infinity let's just go to B now since we're starting at one B's got to be some number bigger than one does that make sense so let's call this B over here somewhere one to B then our what our integral represents is this area from one the area under the curve from 1 to B where this curve is 1/x^2 so if you you feel okay with that so far I really do want to make sure you get the idea not just be able to do it but understand it so the idea is if we have an interval interval from 1 to infinity or negative Infinity to some number let's break this up a little bit let's let's not go to Infinity let's call the the infinite bound here let's call it b or if it was negative Infinity we call it a down here let's call it something well maybe we go ahead and we do this integral the way it is now instead of plugging an actual number like four we're just going to plug in the B and then we'll deal with it later so we know that we can write this as not one to Infinity but one to b b is some number just to the right of one we're representing this area right here that's what we're doing quick head note if you're okay with with that so far let's go ahead let's see if we can do this interg I'm just going to rewrite it so one to be how would I rewrite the integral of 1x2 to actually do the integral what would I do yeah by the way don't start doing silly things things hard things when you have easy integrals don't be doing weird things like partial fractions I have one overx squ partial fractions no don't do that okay don't make things harder than they are which some of you have a tendency to actually do okay uh so make the integrals as easy as possible we know all the integration techniques right now just so you know we got them all now we're just applying them well all for us can you do the intequal sure what is it don't not talk at once I mean that'd be rude okay x to the I me over 1 now of course with definite integrals we evaluate these things well we're going to change this around a little bit because right now looks kind of nasty but we're going to change it around uh where's this integral start interval start where's it yeah and we're calling it B really it's going to be Infinity but we'll deal with that idea in just a second okay let's rewrite this so this is going to be 1x from 1 to B Isn't it nice to deal with some of these easy integrals right now after doing all that stuff that we just did in this chapter can you evaluate 1X from 1 to B yes what's it going to be good we plug in the top number first minus what okay let's clean it up -1/ B + 1 so f youc with that so far that's easy right I mean we've been doing this from calculus one this is nice now here's the issue like a 10-second recap 10 recap is uh this is improper because it's not a finite interval this is cool because it is bounded on that interval that's good news that's the good stuff so bounded yes finite no infinite call the infinite portion of that call it b or call it a uh call it some letter usually we use B for positive Infinity we use a for negative Infinity cuz intervals go from A to B that's why so call that B all right no problem what B is is some number bigger than one so since our interval is starting at one B's got to be to the right of that and what our integral represents here is the area under this curve from 1 to B no problem that's exactly what this idea is about do your integral plug in the B plug in the one simplify it but then let's think about what's happening now when we did this what did we substitute the B for so what do we want the B to go where do we want the B to go we want it to go to Infinity now the way that we deal with going to Infinity is this idea of a limit limit that's right with a limit so as we want to go X goes towards Infinity we can't do that by just plugging in Infinity it's we kind of can we kind of can't um we can because that's really what how we're going to evaluate this thing but the way we need to evaluate with is a limit so what we do now is go where where's the B go well since we want B to approach Infinity we do that with a limit so now we'll just let the uh limit do its work so we're going to do a limit as X sorry not I'm not I made a mistake how do I make a mistake it's not X approaching Infinity it's the B is what we substituted in for our Infinity so now we just got to substitute the back so B goes to posi infinity1 b + 1 well now it hopefully it makes some sense let's let B go to Infinity what happens if B goes to Infinity here so can we find the area under the Curve from one to Infinity of this curve 1x2 that's really cool how much is it one yeah that's the idea so um this idea is we're we're kind of cheating we're not really cheating we're really doing it perfectly mathematically um but the idea is if you're going to Infinity just call it B take a limit as be approaching Infinity of whatever the integral is that way you can actually evaluate you can't plug in Infinity really you you can plug in B then take a limit as B approaches infinity and that's where we we change the problem a little bit show up hands if that might made sense to you is it a really difficult concept kind of interesting right kind of cool um so let me write some notes out for you on what we're going to be doing every time questions I always forget do you have any questions on this okay good did I explain it well enough for you all to understand it yes okay we'll deal with the unbounded version um probably another time but so here's what we know some notes let's say we had an integral from a to infinity or we have an integral from in negative Infinity to B of some function of some function what we do we don't really do every time okay because this what I've done this is technically very inaccurate uh because what I'm calling this is B but I haven't said anything that b is going to Infinity does that make sense to you so what we do right off the bat with our with our improper integrals after we identify what's going on whether it's discontinuity or whether the interval is infinite uh we we do that first then we go ahead and we write out the limit right now you see if we're going from a to Infinity then what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to say which which is the a problem by the way is it the a or the infinity infinity so I'm going to say A to B but in order to do that right away what you should do is say yeah you know what I'm going to take the integral from A to B but I need to let B go to Infinity if it seems trivial to you it's not you're defining what's happening to the B you have to do that it's not that I just get to randomly plug in a b figure it out and then plug in Infinity you can't do that mathematically you do that with a limit so we say no we don't get to plug in Infinity really what we're thinking about is this B it's approaching Infinity it's getting really close to it it's plugged in bigger and bigger and bigger numbers until it makes no difference anymore as compared to Infinity does it make sense to you so this not trivial idea it's sure call it a b but then Define what's happening to b b is going to positive Infinity you do that with a limit now the integral itself this is where you guys get a break the integral itself is it's doable I mean it's everything that we've done so far so basically I'm teaching you today is this that's it that you can do this that instead of an Infinity you put a limit as B approaches Infinity of B this is still Infinity when you think about it we're just kind of Mak it a little bit more doable so we can actually evaluate the integral that was a lot of words did you understand them all all right now next up let's say that we're not going from a to Infinity we're going from negative Infinity to some B what's our problem here okay so the B is not a problem we call negative Infinity our a and then we say okay cool I'm going from a to to B but what's happening to the a where's the a going to go so a approaches negative infity that's right it should match up so a negative Infinity a negative infinity and then the integral no problem you'll know how to do this I'm not saying it's going to be easy but you'll know how to do it because it's something that we've covered before you guys okay so far now we're going to come up with two different words here two uh two words I'm sure you've heard them somewhere in your life before but for integrals we're going to Define them right now these limits are either going to be what's called convergent or Divergent now if the limit exists what that means is that you can add up all the little sums and a finite sum that would be a convergent integral that means that the the area actually exists if the integral adds up and it keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger well then that integral is not going to exist that limit won't exist actually the integral probably will exist but the limit won't exist if that limit doesn't exist well that's Divergent either it doesn't go to a finite number it goes back and forth or it goes always up or always down it doesn't go to one single number if that limit doesn't happen then we call that Divergence so these things things are convergent if the limit exists Divergent if the limit does not exist does that make sense to you yes no so we call these convergent if limit exists we'd say it's Divergent if the limit does not exist convergent basically means this I'll actually write that down look up here so I know that you guys are done writing I can actually talk at you convergent basically means this it means that the area that you're adding keeps getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller as you're approaching infinity or negative Infinity smaller and smaller and smaller to the point where when you add it it's so small that it doesn't make a difference does that make sense to you so it keeps smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller Divergent does this Divergent says it keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger as you keep adding it or it doesn't keep getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller it doesn't do that um or there's no pattern to it it's bigger than smaller than bigger than smaller than bigger than smaller something like that so then the limit will tell us that so don't worry too much about it basically the idea is if limit exists it's going to be convergent because that is happening it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller quick enough if it's Divergent if the limit doesn't exist that means it's not happening so we're getting bigger areas or we're getting areas that uh don't go back to one single number it keeps getting bigger and smaller bigger and smaller does that make sense to you okay would you like to do some examples of course you would so let's do something thankfully these examples won't take 30 minutes A U 30 minutes example they're fairly quick question question just kidding was it on this oh you were joking funny guy is there going to be like in case two where it be taking two like from negative Infinity to Infinity absolutely yeah I'm going show you how to do every case I can think of okay so this is this why this lesson's going to be about three days long is is I'm going to show you everything I can think of as far as what cases go okay we're starting very easy right now but we will have limits that go from negative Infinity to Infinity we have negative well limits that go from negative Infinity to Infinity where they cross over infinite discontinuity and that's about the worst case scenario you can get okay so if you're going from negative Infinity to infinity and you cross over if you cross over more than one that sucks even worse but if you cross over an infinite discontinuity then you have to break up that limit in sorry the integral in at least two of them sometimes more Okie okay so let's start off very basic firstly we want to identify what type of an improper integral if anything we have do we have an improper integral here absolutely well firstly let's see if there's an infinite discontinuity are we defined for an entire domain no are we defined for an entire domain I don't care about the zero if I'm not Crossing zero I don't care I care just where I'm I'm going to so on my interval and my F yes then then we're good there's no infinite discontinuity do you guys get what I'm talking about how about the interval is the interval finite or infinite infinite so what that's called is an infinite interval that's one of these improper forms so if we have an improper form and an infinite interval let's write out exactly what we're going to do with it so tell me how should I rewrite this problem so that I can do it okay do you need the limit I'm not going to check for that or anything on your tests am I of course I am uh limit hello a limit from where to where oh say that correctly from where to where one to and then B goes to where perfect do we change this no pull the three out yeah you can pull the three out absolutely in fact because it's a limit and because that's a constant you can actually pull a three way out here doesn't even matter pull it here pull it here don't care wherever you want to go does that make sense so we can pull the three out for sure can you do this yes integral they're all going to be doable yeah of course for you so we have a limit we have B approaches Infinity I got to warn you um in the section because we've covered all of our integration techniques I'm going to be doing a lot of them pretty quickly uh because I'm I'm going to assume that you have studied the previous four sections that we've done on integration techniques okay so I'm going to cut some steps out uh just for the sake of time because we're going to get some integrals that are kind of nasty you know and I'm not going to repeat all those techniques that we just just learned I'm going to use them here well this a pretty basic One to begin with so what's our integral going to be here 3 Ln absolute value X oh absolute value did you get that from where to where one one to B now be smart about the absolute value look at your interval your interval goes from one to Infinity tell me something about all those numbers they're all positive so your absolute value is kind of irrelevant here but you do need to show it so in our case we've got a limit do you remember something about limits how we always write them until the very last part where we actually get to evaluate them same thing happens here so we will have 3 lnb minus and you do this a couple ways you could pull the three out and have a bracket here or you could have 3 Ln B minus 3 Ln one it really doesn't matter as long as you have the three in the appropriate spot in both both places or being factored out make sense some algebra so I'll probably do it like this because I don't want to have to write the three again I'll do 3 * lnb minus Ln 1 so this is limit as B approaches Infinity of 3 Ln B how much is Ln of one do you know okay so check it out simple integral no problem we've evaluated no big deal we've simplified it as much as we can to the point where now we're going to attempt to find out what happens as B approaches Infinity you guys okay with this one awesome so what happens when B goes to Infinity what's Ln of b as B approaches Infinity oh dear did you know again read it what's Ln of b as B approaches Infinity no Ln of one is zero how can Ln of infinity also be zero doesn't make sense it's a it's it's a increasing function the entire time it's always increasing say what now infinity infinity it's Infinity that's right Ln goes like this remember Ln hope you remember Ln goes to negative Infinity as we approach Zero from the right goes to Infinity as we approach Infinity it's always increasing what that means is that this is infinity that's Infinity tell me something about this integral is it convergent or is it Divergent it's Divergent what that means is that look at this this limit keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger doesn't it means the area keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger it doesn't go to a finite number therefore our area under this curve we can't say what it is because it's an infinite area called Divergent you guys see the difference between convergent and Divergent the one first one we did we actually got an area out of it second one we did no no this right here says that this is Divergent and I wanted to give one to you right off the bat that way you see what I'm talking about when I say Divergent if the limit doesn't exist or if the limit goes to infinity or negative Infinity then we say that that we can't find the area under that curve it's always getting bigger than uh than some finite number so hands of that one made made sense to you okay can we keep on rolling not too bad right not yet at least let's keep going what we're going to do now is um we're going to figure out how to do this in general for any power of X so instead of doing example after example let's try this one let's go from 1 to infinity 1/ x to the n DX you know what I'm guessing that most of you can probably help me out on this one uh what's the first thing that I would do with this particular integral right right limit yeah because what tell me what's wrong with it do I have a discontinuity or an infinite interval here it's infinite interval do you notice how in this case the only number that I have a problem with is zero still I miss the zero on my so I'm good so yeah you know what we just had it on the board a little while ago this will be a limit as what approaches what everybody approaches infity and then we write from where to where please one to and then one okay yeah okay we'll do another step sure can you guys do that first step hello yes no no big deal right you just take care of the infinity make sure you have a limit going to that variable and then take your variable and make it look like it's finite right now make it look like it's going to actual numbers just something bigger than one now let's go ahead and do this in general I know that some people don't really like doing things in general but this is going to save us some a lot of headaches later so check it out first thing we could do always it's going to get annoying I know but you always got to write the limit you always have to do that until you actually Val so do not neglect that are you listening don't neglect that always write it now with 1X to the N I can write that as x to the N DX you see if I have X to any power besides one I can always move that up and I can always do this integral notice that we already took care if you didn't notice this from before we already took care of the case when we have one over x to the first don't we mhm I took care of it in fact the three is irrelevant if the three was a one you would still have something that's infinite do you see what I'm talking about hello yes no so even if this was a one no problem so basically what's 1 to Infinity of 1x DX it's also Divergent it's also a problem okay so we already kind of dealt with that case here let's look at every other case if we do this we'll get a limit as B approaches Infinity of when we do this integral what do you do with like x to the 3 or x to the 3r would be a better you add one so this would be x to the n + 1 n + 1 sure that's exactly what we do we add one to the remember doing that we add one to the power divide by the new power so we do all the time and then we evaluate it from one to B well if we evaluate it from 1 to B we have a limit as B approaches Infinity tell you what I'm going to change this around because I like the look of 1 - n better than n + 1 just me we're going to have remember where the B goes the B is going to go in terms of not N N's going to be a constant okay and it's B is going to go in terms of X so this would be B to the n + 1 over 1 - nus 1 the n + 1 over 1 - n are we okay with that one I want to make sure that you guys are are good with this before we go on any further are you you sure so hey add one divide by the new exponent no big deal plug in the B we got it here plug in the one we got it here it's got a common denom let's simplify this just a little bit so if we simplify we got a limit as B approaches Infinity well in here we have B to the n + 1- 1 notice that one to any power is still one over 1us you know what we can do also anytime you don't have the specific variable that this is approaching oh sorry uh the specific variable is right here like B you can pull out everything in front of your limit so I'm going to pull out the 1 1us you can rationalize this because well n's going to be a constant isn't it so this is always going to be just a fraction pull out the fraction now let's see how I want you guys to see this next I'm going to do a little bit of fancy Fant math because it's going to be easier for you to see what happens next are you ready for it I'm going to force this to factor out a negative so what I'll end up getting is I'll move down here to 1 over 1 - n time the limit B to the infinity I'm going to Force this to be B to the nus1 B to the N minus1 do you guys follow the math on that okay minus one probably need some parenthesis here just to show what that what's happening I'm also going to write this as a fraction limit as B approaches Infinity because this is now a negative exponent what I'm going to do is I'm going to write this as 1 over B to to the N -1 - one we okay with that one are you sure some of you guys are zoning out don't zone out now man you got to be with me here so you okay with uh factoring out the negative from the exponent if we have a negative exponent hey you can write this as 1/ B to the positive exponent that's all I've done here so 1 over 1 - n no problem limit limit this is this -1 - one so far so good yeah now let's think about this for a second when is this going to converge when is it going to diverge because we want to do this once and for all so let's think about this let's say that n let's say that n is well how about we get n is one if n is one think back it just stop with me for a second okay if n is one then this was one correct are you listening yes I need your attention here if n is one then this was one we've already dealt with that case we know it's Divergent does that make sense so we're going to have anything that where n is one is Divergent if you got that here you'd actually get infinity to the zero it turns out that when you do remember our our indeterminate forms when you did that you'd end up getting undefined out of that you get infinity so that would be an issue for us so any = 1 we know it's Divergent how about Nal 2 let's think about Nal 2 if Nal 2 what's 2 - 1 this would be like Infinity to the first Power that's Infinity what's one over infinity this would be convergent you'd actually get a number out of that how about three what if n's three same deal or four same deal or five same deal now we already did the one correct what if n was Z or 1 or -2 if n is zero we get 0 - 1 how much is that1 so basically we have B to the 1 wouldn't we that would be B to the first up here that would be an Infinity do you guys get what I'm talking about so we get this uh we get this statement I'm going to write it right up here so from all this stuff we know a couple things so let's think about the integral from 1 to Infinity of 1 over X2 I don't care what it is you can do it now without well you can you can't evaluate it but you can see whether you should evaluate or not so check it out let's say that uh X was to the first Power we already dealt with that that was diversion let's say x was to the second power so n was two we talked about that that would be convergent or three convergent or four convergent basically this is convergent if n is greater than what number please one one yeah not equal to one but greater than one if n is two or three or four or five or six then we'd have Infinity to the positive power Infinity to a positive power would be Infinity 1 over infinity is 0 0 - 1 is oh netive 1 no big deal that would be 1 time whatever this is does that make sense now that's kind of cool right it gives you almost a formula for doing that cool uh now let's say the N was equal to one we talked about that at n equals 1 I have an Ln we just did the Ln that diverged if n is less than one if n is less than one we'd have zero Orga 1 or -2 we'd get B to a negative power is that do you with me B to a negative power is the same thing over under one is the same thing as B to a positive power by itself Infinity to a positive power is infinity infinity minus one I don't care what you do it's still Infinity that's an infinite limit that that limit is not going to exist for something that's going to be convergent so basically this converges at n is bigger than one diverges at n is less than or equal to one that's the idea so here's the here's what I'm trying to tell you if I give you this should you bother to find out whether this thing has a limit or not yes absolutely because that's a positive exponent that's uh that n equals 3 no problem that's bigger than one but if I this one would you bother no heck no you know automatically that's going to be Divergent for sure don't even worry about it just say oh look at that uh n's less than one hello divergent or if it equals one if it's that you go don't even need to worry about it that's going to be a Divergent you with me okay so that's that's kind of a nice little thing that we can we can do here just look at that didn't make sense to you this whole explanation there's one more thing I was going to say I don't remember what it was mustn't that important oh yeah I know what it was what that basically says is that because all these negative powers are going to be Divergent change that into a positive and what you end up getting is X 4th DX don't you you get a polinomial do you realize that if I take an integral from one to Infinity of any polom pols don't have negative Powers okay any polom pols go like this they go like or they go like this that's their end behavior see the positive in or negative Infinity are any of those limits going to be convergent for us no they're going to exist but they're going to be positive infinity or negative Infinity they're not going to exist to a finite number therefore these integrals will all be Divergent does that make sense to you okay we're going to stop there we'll continue with this next time all right let's get started on our next example the next example is another case of where we have these infinite intervals where we're starting at a number or we're starting at an Infinity but we're going we have one one section that's defined like one part of the interval is defined and one section that's not so here we have yeah we're starting to one but we're not ever ending we're going to Infinity do you remember what we do right up the bat when we have a scenario like this what's the idea it's a limit that's right so what we're saying is that no we really can't go to Infinity the way we want to because we can't really plug in Infinity since we don't know what it is but what we can do is we can say all right well I know I could take a limit from what's our problem here is it the one or the Infinity infity of course it is the one's great the infinity we call that some letter we typically call the upper bound B and the lower bound a so if your Infinity is in the upper bound call it B and then what we say is all right well this is fine this now becomes something that we can use a definite inte interval for sorry definite integral for where B is a number the limit idea says okay now you're going from one to some number bigger than one this is the idea then the limit says okay now take that number that you're going to where we called it B and move it forever to the right so move it forever towards infinity and that's why we have to have this limit here and then the rest of the integral well that doesn't change after that the nice thing about these well we know integration techniques is we spent all this time doing which is fantastic question uh if we just avoid writing that to the end is that technically incorrect yep yep we got to you have to write the limit you have to have everything I'm showing you is what you need cuz if you just go from 1 to B that doesn't make sense oh I meant just avoiding the B Al together until you do the actual um you could do the integral first I I prefer you doing the limit uh this is what's what's going on here we're changing to a definite integral uh where B is just some number to the right of one or whatever number you've given then you do it and then you evaluate with b and then you take your limit uh really that's a proper form super big deal for some people I don't know I'd like you to do it this way though okay so continuing can we do an integral like that one hello can you do the integral and that's pretty easy what are you going to do with it to I I'm deal with a lot of people who come up with questions going man how do I do this and I'm look at man you guys are making this way too hard way too hard start with the easy stuff calculus is supposed to be well how can you make it easier all right so when we look at this when not we're not thinking integration by parts are off the bat or whatever we're thinking well do Basics is it in your integration table well no can you do it with a Uub yes yeah do a Uub then do something simple if you can so with us we go okay cool well we can do Uub so U = -2X du = -2 DX or du over -2 equals DX something really nice what that means is we get the limit for got the limit we get the limit as B approaches Infinity of the integral from 1 to B uh what's going to be on the inside of our integral u e to the u e to the U that's right e to the U and then DX no no no we got du over -2 this is actually kind of a a pleasant break for us as far as dealing with some simple integrals isn't it kind of nice uh where we we know how to do these they don't take four pages for one problem uh what are you going to do now what do you think okay so you know what you can actually do I don't know if you know this but you can bring that negative one2 to the front of your integral but you can also do it to the front of the limit so whatever you want if you want to bring it all the way out front and just do - one2 time the limit as B approaches Infinity U I'm also going to do the integral so we pulled out the the negative one2 what's the integral of remember this has be gone right this is our negative one2 what's the integral of e to the u e u I love that integral and then where are we evaluating to yeah one to B notice how if we pull out that negative - one2 it makes what we're evaluating just a little bit easier it's kind of nice we don't even have to worry about that it's just going to be neg 1/2 times the limit quick Head n if you're okay with with that so far now we get to evaluate so what we know is that we're going to have - 12 time the limit as B approaches Infinity of let's evaluate what goes first the one or the b e to the B minus E to the 1 now if you're going to do this correctly you do have to be very good at understanding what's happening to these functions as you approach Infinity some of you struggled with this when we dealt with limits the first time would I mess it up what oh my bad uh it's it's actually going to matter here too I got all wrapped up and talking about Infinity I forgot my substitution you mean I was just testing you you passed fantastic job yeah what do you do here then okay yeah so before we evaluate you should have caught me earlier thanks a lot guys limit of e to the -2X yeah good why is that important because you know what typically typically what I I do in my sub in my substitution problems I change balance so if you're used to doing it like I was don't make the mistake that I did uh where you forgot forget to substitute back in for that you that would have been a really big mistake I'm glad you guys caught me on that uh did you did everyone see the mistake that I made okay it's on video watch it again you can see the mistake that I made all right uh yeah make sure that you're actually doing that substitution back because if you haven't changed your bounds that's a must you have to do it so very good job nice catch so negative 1 have limit as B approaches Infinity what we end up getting is e to -2b minus E to-2 you still okay so far yes well maybe what we want to do is make this so it's a little bit more understandable on what's going on with our function so if you can do it from right here cool go ahead and evaluate your limit from right here if you're the type of person that says you know what I really don't like dealing with all these negative exponents that that's hard for me to do well then what I would do if I was you is I'd keep thega 1/2 out front I'd write the limit as B approaches infinity and then I'd rewrite these two things because maybe that's going to be a little easier for you how can you write rewrite e to the -2b what could you do [Music] minus yeah maybe that's a little bit easier to see what's happening now back to my point that I skipped over important point to make my point is this you're going to have to be really good at determining what's happening to your function as you approach infinity or negative Infinity it's really important to do that so when we look at this what happens to e to the 2B as that b goes to Infinity what's what's happening to that this little piece goes to Infinity remember what e looks like e looks like this so as X goes to Infinity e going to Infinity what that means is that if we have one over so Infinity 2 * infinity is infinity e to the infinity is infinity how much is one over infinity yeah this thing goes to zero 1 over infinity is zero for sure now what's this thing go to this is it it's a constant so what that means is that we're going to have this - one2 times notice how when I evaluate the limit when I evaluate as B goes to Infinity I stop writing the limit but I don't do it until I actually evaluate it you guys clear on that one we do have to have it every single time until we get down to oh yeah okay when B goes to Infinity this thing goes to zero then in here we have what okay 0 - 1 e^ 2 which is equal to let's do it 12 * 0 - 1 e^ 2 how much are you going to get negative positive positive 1 over 2 e^2 what I find just amazing about this is that what we really did here is we found the area under a curve what curve this curve we found an area under this curve from one to Infinity so start at the number one and going forever and we got a legitimate area underneath that thing isn't that interesting it means that we're getting so close to probably zero as we go to or some some numbers you go to the right that it doesn't make any difference when we add that that's kind of that's cool to me I don't know why that's cool but it's so cool is it cool to you that we can add something up from one to infinity and get an actual number by the way did the example make sense to us good you guys want to keep going we going make it a little bit more difficult as we go well not more difficult but uh more involved as I want to give you some different cases so let's continue so I guess long story May real short um the integrals are going to be very similar to what you've done before the only idea is you need to identify what type of improper integral we have whether we have an infinite interval or an infinite uh sorry emphasize the wrong should level an infinite discontinuity there so whether we have a discontinuity or infinite interval so in our case here when we get this one what do we got do we have an infinite discontinuity or do we have an infinite interval which one both both neither one or the other what do you think do you know I want you to think about sign are there any problems with sign ever do you ever have a discontinuity on the function sign never it goes like this forever and ever so from 0 to Infinity are we going to have an infinite discontinuity no we're good it's going to be defined for this entire re range of numbers because it's always defined for the entire interval of numbers does that make sense to you now we do have a situation here we have well we got the infinity this would be called an infinite interval so I want you to do the first step write this as instead of going from zero to Infinity we're going to go from zero to what INF and in order to do that we add this little thing in front of our integral what is it okay so you should have done that already or be doing that right now so we think about this and we go no no no let's just start at zero because that's good but let's go to some number just to the right of zero and then let's take that number and push it to Infinity after we've done the integral so we're not really cheating but we're we kind of manipulating our integral properly so we're saying hey let's go from 0 to B that way it's definite it's a defin integral this says now at the very end take your B and push it to Infinity that's the idea now I know that um we've been dealing with some really difficult integrals so don't make these harder than they actually are don't do anything fancy for the integral of sin x what's the integral of sin x awesome so we're going to have a limit as B approaches Infinity cosine X from0 to B let's plug them in we're going to have a limit as B approaches Infinity cosine B okay minus cosine of Z let's see what we get out of this thing so negative cosine B plus cosine 0 let's start with the easy part uh what's cosine 0 how much is that so we know this is going to be equal to one now think about negative cosine B think about just cosine B what is cosine b as B approaches Infinity what what is it back and for cosine cosine does I negative cosine negative cosine does does it ever go to a number no no no it's it's going to go up and down down and up forever and ever and ever correct so my question is as cosine sorry as B approaches Infinity does cosine B ever go to a single number goes to lots of numbers goes goes from a range of negative 1 to one so if it doesn't ever go to a number does the limit exist it's diverent it's divergent This limit doesn't exist because cosine does this forever it doesn't ever go to one or negative one or some number between there this is a DNA type of limit if you get a limit that does not exist what do we know about the area here what do we know about that is it going to be a convergent integral where we can find an area or a Divergent area integral where we can't find the area so this is what I meant about um those cases so where we had convergent or or Divergent if we have an integral that equals some function that when we evaluate we get a single number like we did here this would be convergent or Divergent so if the limit exists it's actually equal to a valid number like this one we have an integral that's convergent our improper interal integral would be convergent show F be okay with that idea convergent means the limit exists if you get an integral so that when you evaluate with our limit here we get something that doesn't exist like this one it doesn't actually get to a number or something where we have infinity or negative Infinity that's when we get this Divergence so there's basically three cases the cases are we get an actual number with our limit we're good that meant convergent the other two cases are Divergent where we have a limit that does not exist because it doesn't go to a single number like cosine doesn't or where we get an infinity or negative Infinity that limit it it exists kind of but it's not an actual number that we call Convergent it's just ever growing or ever decreasing show fans feel okay with the idea okay so here we'd say this integral is Divergent you know you might have guessed that just by looking at the function itself look at sign does sign ever go to a no solid place no really it's always going back and forth so if you thought about what integrals actually mean integral means area under a curve so if we're thinking about hey you know what I want you find the area under the curve from zero to Infinity of sign you're going all right well there mean area then very little area then more area then very what's going to happen there you know it's going to it's going to go forever like that you're never never going to be able to tell me how much the area actually is so far so good okay cool have I explained these two well enough for youall to understand them guys have any I'm going to ask you now before I erase them any questions on these before we get going okay so doesn't exist it's Divergent if the limit does exist it's convergent we're good to go we can actually find the area that's very cool let's continue can we ramp them up a little bit these ones can get kind of boring if we do simple integrals all all the time so let's see how this works with something a little bit funner okay first Duty first Duty we got is to Define what type of are you laughing because I said Duty uh you guys watch too much scrubs um anyway what was I say Duty first Duty the first Duty should be the second Duty anyway um first D is to find what type of improper integral we actually have whether it's an infinite interval whether it's an infinite discontinuity here this is all defined for for the entire domain X and time e x we're good to go we have no issues here so it's not an infinite discontinuity those should be kind of obvious to us when we get them you'll see them what we do have is an infinite interval we actually start though at negative Infinity so we're going to do something very similar to this idea only I'm not going to be going from a number to B I'm going to be going from how would I write this okay so because our lower bound is an Infinity I'm going to call that a zero I'm good with the zero we're just going to go from a to zero does that make sense to you now of course we got to Define what we're actually doing here so I can't just go from a to zero and not Define what a is doing what's a doing approaching infity good let's make sure we get that negative Infinity in there and that means the only way we can do that to let a approach negative in Infinity is with its idea of a limit quick head now if you're okay with that one so typically we call our upper bounds B's we call our lower bounds A's if they are positive infinity or negative Infinity respectively after that what's really cool again is that we know how to do all these integrals so let's go through this integral right now is the time we'd go okay well cool we defined What's Happening Here we now have a definite integral and then we're going to let a go to negative Infinity to to take this idea of negative Infinity to zero but we just got to worry about this right now so the integral of x edx DX let's go through what we know does it fit the integration table no can you do a substitution with it could you do a substitution if I did this yeah that would be nice so that's what we would do in this case if I don't have that then no we can't do a substitution can you do integration by parts yes you can it's a product we can do integration by parts with it so let's do integration by parts what would you pick what would you pick for do you remember how to do integration my parts it's been a while so this is one of those things that you should kind of uh do from time to time on on your own uh whether I give you homework or not because we haven't really covered that in a long long time all right but it is part of this chapter so what would you pick yeah U is X remember how to pick U you want to pick these u and v this way you want to pick so that you can do the integral of what's left over very easily and that the derivative or that the derivative of U becomes easier so here I'd say hey can I do the integral of x I can but it gets worse it gets X2 I don't want that can you do theal of e x uhuh andal e x is okay that's nice can you do the derivative of e thex that's e thex doesn't get nicer can you do the derivative of x that's one that's nicer so our appropriate Choice here is = X and then V equals way I always teach this I say hey cover up your u v is the integral of whatever's left over so dual DX V = evx because that's really nice and then do you remember the formula for for doing integration by parts honestly I heard okay very VD very good so so we have you know the annoying part about this is we still have to write the limit because that that's really still what we're doing okay so we've got a limit we've got a approaches infity negative Infinity that's right now in this limit we don't have the integral anymore we have well our integration but part says we do a u * V so what are we going to write first very good x * e x you guys with me still so far minus the integral d good so U * V minus the integral of V du but du is DX so we have integral of v and then du is our DX show P feel okay with that one by the way for those of you who are thinking well what about our balance here don't worry about it you're going to evaluate later don't evaluate this integral right now wait till you do it then evaluate the entire thing from a to zero does that make sense to you if you try to do it here just makes it too hard okay okay so wait wait on it for a second till the very end till your integral is actually done you got that otherwise you're you're really working overboard so I am going to put this here I'm going to put the a to zero so I don't forget about it but I know I have one more step in here to do before I actually evaluate that so I'm going to have a limit as a approaches negative Infinity I have X I've got e to X this is why integration by parts works so nice for this we reduce the power of our X by 1° if we've done that then that means the rest of this integral is really nice for us what is the rest of that integral for us from what are we going to do now what do you think we could simplify we could Factor if you want to sure you could Factor this you could do it right now if you want to it doesn't really matter to me how you do this U if we do decide to Factor this since you guys said that we'll have a limit as a goes to Infinity uh what perfect okay well now let's go ahead and evaluate that so what we've done so far is we' first thing we do we identify that we actually have an improper integral we we find out the type whether it's the infinite discontinuity we haven't even talked about yet or an infinite interval if it's an infinite interval no problem we know how to do that let's just take a limit and instead of the infinity we'll make it definite for like the right now it's a definite integral right now that means that we can actually do it okay by fundamental theor of calculus this actually works so we do this so that this is actually possible then we realize oh but you know what B wasn't actually definite B was this number that we want to now move to infinity or a was this number that now we want to move to negative Infinity so we're cheating a little bit we're calling this a definite integral when we know it's not but it uses the fundamental the calculus to actually do the definite integral and then says now use a limit idea now move that number to infinity or negative Infinity hey just evaluate the limit so when we do we're going to evaluate the integral but then evaluate the limit so a is going to eventually go to negative Infinity we got to plug it in first to see what happens which number do you plug in first make sure you do that okay make sure you you follow the the rules for evaluating your integrals here so we'd have e to 0 * 0 - 1 minus E to the a * Aus one okay let's simplify some stuff here right now because there's I have no idea what's going on with this I just got to I got to simplify this cuz now it's a little bit too confusing for me do you guys see what I'm talking about a little bit too much going on so uh what can we do with this thing e to0 is how much good 0 - 1 is so this whole piece it's 1 * 1 this thing goes to netive 1 very good also I'll tell you right now what's going to have to happen here because I have infinity and infinity I'm probably going to want to distribute this real quick so might have been nice if we hadn't have factored that but you know what not a big deal we take care of right now so in our limit we've got -1 we're going to have minus a * e to the A and then plus e to the a can you check my work I want to make sure that my algebra is correct too can you can you check that to see that I'm I'm okay on that one are we okay with that so we I've distributed this this is a e a minus E to the a but then my negative changes sign so minus a e to the and plus e so feel okay with with that so far now let's think about what's going on here do not neglect your knowledge of limits from your chapter six stuff that we've done okay you got to really follow that so if we look at this part of this is really easy so check out the uh the negative one what's that going to go to that's easy check out the e to the a oh let's think about this e to the a when a approaches infity so basically what's e to the negative Infinity it's zero that's right so this is one negative 1 this is zero that's fantastic now please listen carefully this is a * e to a correct we already know that this part is zero e to the Nea Infinity is zero but this Isa Infinity so we have an Infinity Time Zero that's an indeterminate remember that ohd it's coming back this is exciting it's an indeterminate look at how much stuff is involved in this had you not done indeterminate forms you couldn't do this problem had you not done integration by parts you couldn't do this problem and now we have improper integrals so we've got lots going on in this stuff this is why this calculus builds so nicely for us but you got to remember it all right so it's it's not like other classes where you can forget a section and ah you're probably okay you need everything to do these problems sometimes so for us we go all right well cool this is easy 1 this is easy zero but this one well that's an Infinity time0 type of indeterminant form what that means when we have Infinity time 0 we've got to rewrite one of those in order to get an Infinity over infinity or a 0 over Z in either case we can use ly remember ly talls our favorite word in limits ly tall so I'm going to do something here I'm going to separate these what I know is that this is this is cool this is NE 1 this is also zero so I'm going to do this I'm going to separate these limits I know I'm going to have1 I'm going to have minus the limit a * E A as a approaches negative infinity plus Z so basically I just want to focus on this guy I want to see if you guys are okay with the math on that are you okay on where the negative one came from yeah that's this limit uh limits are seable by addition and subtraction this is zero no problem I'm just focused here my minus is right here so I have a limit as a approaches Infinity of this guy just that guy quick show hands if you okay with with that one now if you don't remember how to do the 0 time Infinities or Infinity time zeros rewrite this as a fraction so take one part of this and move it to a move to a denominator now what I know is that it's going to be easiest if I move this e to the a to the denominator so I'm going to take a little little break here we'll call this asteris the limit as a approaches negative Infinity of a * E A can be Rewritten as a limit as a approaches negative Infinity of I'm going to keep the a I'm going to keep the a right where it is but the e to the a I want to rewrite that can you tell me how can I write a * e to the A as a over something to thetive yes in your heads is this the same as this stuff M now check it out remember whenever we change something in our limits I don't know if you do remember it was a long time ago but if you don't remember rewatch uh the end of chapter 6 okay on on the video and it will show you all this stuff this was the indeterminate forms whenever you do something algebraically you re-evaluate it and you see what actually happened so so if we re-evaluate this how much is a as a approaches negative Infinity now how much is e to the a as a approaches negative Infinity remember a negative * netive is a positive how much is this it's Infinity so we have a form of infinity over infinity does that make sense this is a prime candidate for yay l a fun word even so L doll can you explain to me please how you do a lals rule what do you do take ative of the top over of the bottom cool is it a quo rule no no derivative of numerator is this is why we left the a where it was okay if we hadn't if we made it 1 over a our a power would grow and our E power would not decrease so that's why we left a where it is because the derivative of a is that's beautiful the derivative of e to the a can you tell me what the derivative of e to the a is some said e the a some you said negative e to a which one's right what gives you that chain oh my gosh we even have chain R here so derivative means you leave it alone you leave e to the a alone but you multiply by the derivative of whatever functions inside there this a function of a der of a is1 now can you evaluate this limit now yeah sure how much is e to the Nega so what was what was that again e to thega a as a approaches negative Infinity oh my gosh so check it out if a goes to negative Infinity you got negative Infinity there right negative negative Infinity is e to the infinity is infity negative Infinity I don't care what it is if it's infin if it's a number over infinity you get how much Z this is zero now this was our asteris so we move right back up here so what our limit is is what do we have left on this thing this whole thing went to zero What's really in I I don't want you to forget what we're actually doing okay a lot of people in calculus they end up learning how to do this stuff but not really what what you are doing uh what do we what do we just do here what do we find area under this curve from negative Infinity all the way up to zero and how much is it equal to interesting that means it's below the x-axis that's what that area means the majority of it below the x-axis should Advance be loated with this example so we do hey infinite interval no problem make it definite just Define what's happening this means that we can actually do the integral by integration by parts or whatever we have here integration by parts saying hey u x equals integral the rest do integation by parts U * V minus integral of V to evaluate that thing once you've done the complete integral not right here but after you've done the whole thing evaluate it then simplify it and then work with your limit you've have you covered haven't you covered all this stuff before yeah oh nothing's really new nothing it's just putting it all together now sure you okay with it okay can we move on a little bit do it finally in a roll these problems don't take 45 minutes a problem like before which is nice too you're going to love that on your homework I'm sure well except for this [Applause] one what okay okay okay why F why do we do this why you want to murder us oh my gosh um let's think it through let's think this through first thing are we defined because we always check this first okay look at your function inside of your intergral is this function defined for your entire interval if you say no then you better give me a number that doesn't work here and you better rewrite so if you just guessed at it and said mm cuz it looks funny uh probably not the best thing to do all right so why don't you think about it is there anything that gives us a problem in this function is e to the X defined everywhere yes yes so this is fine is e to the 2x defined everywhere yes and if I add it to one do I have a problem in my domain no no this is defined everywhere but that's what I'm asking you to check you got to be good with find a domain this is why your teachers taught you how to find domain so you go oh you know what uh my domain here is all real numbers therefore on my interval of all real numbers I'm good to go I don't have to worry about any infinite discontinuities because there are none on this function I know I just talked fast but did that make sense to you are you sure there's nothing that makes this zero or negative therefore if I if this is always positive it's being squared so no problem it's positive if this is always positive and I add one to it it's still always positive it can't ever be zero can't ever give me any problems this is always defined they're all both they're both always defined so my entire rational function is always defined for entire interval now the problem is what's the problem here what's our problem yeah it's this idea of oh my gosh we've got this double infinite interval where I'm not going from negative Infinity to a number like zero I'm not going from zero to a number like Infinity I'm going from negative Infinity to Infinity so what in the world are we going to do yeah you know what we're going to do is instead of thinking of this as one big integral let's think of it from negative Infinity to I don't care what number you pick it's going to be the same whatever you want to pick um now I'm probably going to pick the easiest number I can think of to plug in I'm going to pick zero because zero for me would be the easiest number to plug in you guys know hopefully from your Calculus one class whenever you took it that you can actually separate integrals like that start from wherever your a is introduce some intermediate number c and then go from that number c to where your ending value is B so instead of from A to B we go from hey a to c and then again from C to B and we add those intergal together that's legal to do as long as you have no problems in between there that's legal to do quick head there if you're okay with that one hey have we seen stuff like this yeah have we seen stuff like this can you guys do the next step for me write out what you would do change these into our limits for us okay remember that lower bounds typically change to A's upper bounds typically change to B so go for it what is nice about this though is that we don't have to do the integral twice since we're just rewriting the same thing our integrand right there hasn't really changed uh we'll just do the same idea for both of these these integrals at one time so here's what I'm asking you to do I'm asking you to firstly understand that when I have this type of integral goes from negative Infinity to Infinity you do have to do this with two integrals here you have to separate it so we have to have at least some solid Bound in between there call it zero call it one whatever you want zero is going to be easier to plug in remember that we do have to evaluate these things right so we're going to have to plug in this number twice zero is going to be easier to plug in than7 or something like that you will oddly get the same answer out of that but it's going to be easier to plug in if you have a zero so we'll have instead of going from negative Infinity to Z what's my bounds of integration going to change to now I'm going to Define it limit as perfect the inside of my integral my integrant is not changed Plus what's the next thing I'm going to write as good well if I've called B positive Infinity Zer doesn't change with infinity I'm going to call that b e to X over 1 1 + 2 that's not right e 2x okay quick show hands be okay with this idea just a combination of two ideas that we've had before and here's a nice part once you've done this I don't want you to do each of these integrals independent of each other understand that they're exactly the same you guys get it so off to the side I'm not even going to worry about the eight to zero I don't care I'm not going to worry about the zero to B I don't care about that I'm going to just do the integral of e x over 1 + e 2x let's just do that take this idea and run with it afterwards and then we'll evaluate whatever we get twice from a to zero and then from0 to B do you understand that idea subtit integral off to the side now hopefully you can do this integral let's walk through it is it a substitution yeah if you say no okay if you say yes explain that to me = e oh my gosh someone's good at substitution true yes hey let's be smart about this don't jump to a conclusion if I don't know how to do it rewrite it think about these things think of can you find a derivative somewhere in your problem if you can then you have a substitution here so e to X not a problem e the o e 2x no let's think about that as e e X2 if that's the case a substitution of u = e to x man it works nice du = e x DX the derivative of e x is e x check this out here's e x DX here's du it's right there you guys follow me on this one okay so integral that looks really hard right now not so hard tell me what's going to be in the integral tell one okay so this goes away this is basically you can write du even if you want to I'll show you that you can write du because e to X DX is Du e to X DX is Du uh over what 1 now if you don't like the DU being there okay call it a one put the D over here that's no big deal I just want to make sure that you are okay doing our substitution e 2x is e x quantity s and then doing = e x hey no problem this is 1 + u^2 = e x DX we got a 1 du show okay with that one now you've got a couple options here you can do this the hard way or you do this integration table way the hard way would be a trig sub the hard way would be and this would be just fine if you want to do this remember doing this even though you don't have a square root you can put one in there you square root of this whole thing squared you would have square root of 1 + U ^2 you'd have U and you'd have 1 you would have tan th = U does that make sense you do it that way or you could recognize that this right here is actually in your integration table now when we're doing trigonom sorry when we're doing integrals the first thing we should be looking for is our integration table right we shouldn't make things harder than they have to be we should try substitutions and integration table first well if this is in our integration table that's brilliant how much is it 10 verse terse terse up a new word terse tangent inverse of U yeah absolutely that's exactly what that is now let's not make a mistake I did before by the way would you guys know how to finish it off if you did the triangle let's say you didn't see this on your test could you do that sure you know trig sub tan Thal U dual see s d Theta you'd have a little bit of work to do here but what you'd end up getting is a see squ Theta over see Square Theta You' get one the integral of 1 is Theta Thal tan inverse of U bam it's right there it's exactly the same thing that we would get so tan inverse U what's the next thing I'm going to do substitute very good so if I substitute I get tan inverse uh oh tan inverse of what perfect tan inverse of U no no no tan inverse of e x so your fans feel okay with that so far now I'm going to rewrite this because I want to be a a little bit more clear than what I'm being here so do you have any questions on on this side no all right I'm going to show you exactly what's going on with this thing here so what we ended up getting was these two integrals and then we Chang them to okay some definite integrals so we can actually evaluate them but we made our limit so that these bounds go to negative infinity and positive Infinity respectively so I'm going to rewrite this piece then we're going to look at what happens in conjunction with that so we had a limit as a approach negative Infinity the integral from a to 0 e to x 1 + e 2x DX big plus limit as B approaches positive Infinity 0 to B of the same integrand you guys okay with that so far now we've already done the integral of e x 1 + e 2x how much did this integral give us so let's just change those parts so if I know that the integral of e x 1 + e 2x is actually tan inverse of e to X which it is can you tell me where I'll be evaluating this thing from sure is that pretty straightforward to you guys to me it makes perfect sense I want to make sure it makes perfect sense to you so we say hey this integral is this thing therefore if I want to evaluate this integral from a to zero I just evaluate this thing from a to zero now I can't forget what limit the plus yes but I also can't forget this this limit plus now I get the same integral which is why we only do it once it's silly if you do itce this the same thing this integral is also tan inverse of e x I'm going to evaluate that from where to where please and I'm not going to forget the there's only one right answer here limit as B approaches inin okay what I want to know is can you make the jump from doing our integral here to evaluate our integrals here show things if you can make the job okay what do we do now so are we still going to have limits right now [Music] yes have you evaluated the limit yet no no right now what we're doing is we're look it look if I didn't have this limit I'd still have to evaluate wouldn't I me you haven't done limit yet so I'd still be plugging numbers in so I'd have tan inverse of e to what comes first the a or the zero zero the zero comes first minus tan inverse of that's very common for people to make that mistake it really is they go oh well zero always comes no no no the top top bound your B always gets evaluated first and then you do your lower bound so if hands feel okay with with that one are you sure okay so here's one big plus limit as B approaches Infinity tan inverse let's try this again tan inverse of E2 that would it be zero first or B first minus tan inverse of e 0 now are you guys okay with that one notice why we still have our limits have you let a go to negative Infinity yet that's why you still do limit now we get to let a go to negative Infinity we let B go to positive Infinity so we're going to stop writing limits right now let's think about this how much is e to the 0o hello so this is one how much is e to the a as a approaches negative Infinity z z very good this is zero as a goes to negative Infinity e to the a this is e to the negative Infinity e to the X goes like this so as negative Infinity we're going to zero how about e to the B as B goes to Infinity how much is that going to be Infinity very very good e to the infinity is infinity how about e to the Z again so now that I let these go to their appropriate places I stop writing the limit this this was a value in limit saying hey look at that uh e to the a as a goes NE infity that's zero and this one's going to be Infinity so we have tan inverse of 1 minus tan inverse of 0 plus tan inverse of infinity that looks a little weird to write but we'll write itus tan tan inverse of 1 now we got to be good at tan inverse let's see what happens we're almost done with this thing how much is Tan inverse of 1 very good so this piece Pi 4 it says tan of Pi 4 gives you 1 therefore tan inverse of 1 is pi 4 how about tan inverse of 0 Z tangent of 0 gives you zero therefore tan inverse of 0 gives you zero plus how much oh this is an important one how much is Tan inverse of infinity so basically tangent of what value will give you infinity pi/ 2 will remember tangent looks like this at pi/ 2 that make sense so if tangent of Pi / 2 is ASM totic uh then we have a Infinity so therefore tan inverse of Infinity is/ 2 it's a little weird because we can't actually plug in Infinity but we think of it like that would think of how can I get really close to Infinity with a tan inverse it's p / 2 minus we already did this one it's Pi 4 what's our final answer what Flo me what's really cool is that we have this function right with e to X in there e x 1 plus e 2X and somehow we get a pi over two out of that thing as a solid area isn't that kind of cool yeah so if that made sense to you good deal all right so the last little bit that we've got to cover in this section is instead of an infinite interval we got to find out what happens with an infinite discontinuity what that means is that instead of going from like a negative Infinity to a number or a number to infinity or even remember the last one we had negative Infinity to positive Infinity somewhere within our interval whatever it is our function is not bounded what that means that we're going to to infinity or negative Infinity along the Y AIS so basically we just have an ASM toote somewhere along the interval on which we're trying to integrate do you guys see the difference in the idea yeah infinite intervals go this way for Infinity infinite discontinuities go this way to Infinity the function is actually going to Infinity let me give you an example and it's going to clear everything up so first example let's say I want to go from 0 to 9 find the area of the following function from 0 to 9 now right there is that an infinite interval or a finite interval sure that's that's great so we don't have to worry about limit of B going to infinity or a going to negative Infinity we're not worried about that however remember the first thing I told you to check when you're talking about your your definite integrals is well uh look at your balance of integration and see if your function is defined for that entire interval is it defined for our entire interval No No in fact What's Happening Here with this function is this thing looks a sketch here looks kind of like this where as we go towards Infinity yeah cool we're going to get you know smaller and smaller values because we have a fraction over a number that's growing even though it's a square root it's still a growing denominator does that make sense to you however as we get towards zero What's Happening as we get towards Z it's going up it's going towards Infinity because when we're dividing by smaller and smaller numbers we're getting this oh what well we got an undefined Zone here and that's an issue so as we get closer to zero we have this issue we have what's called an infinite discontinuity it's not continuous it's going towards Infinity the function is not bounded show feel okay with with this one okay now on the left side of zero well we have nothing because we can't even plug in negatives because we got square root so this is basically what our graph looks like you got it yeah so here's our idea instead of going from 0 to 9 what's the problem here is it the zero or is it the nine or it somewhere between there Z it's the zero the zero is the problem so tell you what we're going to use a very similar idea to what we did last time instead of going from 0 to 9 maybe will go from I'm sorry what was the problem again zero is the problem or nine is a problem we'll go from C to 9 and we'll make C some intermediate value tell me something hey you ready tell me something if this was a number like one could you integrate this thing very easily piece of cake if it was like 01 you could still do it 0.1 you could still do it zero not so much we're going have to have a different idea so it's really similar to the idea of well we can't actually plug in Infinity but we can plug in a number right and then let that number go to Infinity with a limit so the idea here is all right well let's let's call it not zero but C now the question is what do we want to happen after we're done with this thing what do we want to happen to our C where is our C supposed to go okay our C so we want our c C to approach zero yeah that's right we want C to approach zero now there's a problem with this and this is why we talked about where the functions to find begin with is there any function on the left hand side of our zero so what this says if you remember anything about limits what approaches zero means is that the function does this from both sides remember that we have to make this not a both-sided limit but a one-sided limit so we're going to have to approach Zero from a specific side right side from the right side so we do use a plus or minus good what we want is let me recap this real quick so we understand everything about it then we're I'm going to give you the definition for it good to go the idea is well you know what the interval is finite that's fantastic but our function is not defined for the whole thing we have an infinite discontinuity wherever that happens listening wherever that happens change it to a c what we're saying is that okay I can't define the zero here it's undefined so let's call it C that way I can even do my integral we're basically changing this to a definite integral right now from a number to n no problem can't you do a definite integral from a number to n we just talked about how we could after we're all done then we'll say well what do we want to happen to our c what happens there approaches zero we don't want the C to be here we want our C to be there we're going to let that c Goes To Zero from the right hand side this is the idea should hands feel okay with the idea all right so basically this is where we get our our limit again so we'll go right fantastic I can do an integ from C to 9 I just have to let the C approach Zero from the right hand side of the same function so we're saying 0 to 9 no no no we'll go C to 9 that's a definite integral fundamental the calculus says we can evaluate definite integrals that's why we're doing this right now so we go Okay C to9 cool deal do the integral plug in nine plug in C subtract the two values and then at the very end go wait a minute let's trick it again let's say no no I don't want just c a finite number I want to say that thing is going to go to Zero from the right hand side it's going to get closer and closer and closer and closer and closer quick head KN not if you're okay with the idea now it's just a matter of evaluating it's going to be a limit again can you guys evaluate this integral what would you do with this it yeah so C Goes To Zero from the right remember we still have to write that C to 9 by the way if you didn't if you didn't catch where the C is coming from a is typically called a lower limit B is typically called a upper sorry lower bound B is your upper bound so if we had negative Infinity we' call that our a our positive Infinity would be our B anywhere in between these two numbers it's typically a c so that's where the C's coming from okay so y all said that this should be x to the what am I going to do here x to the what oh wait I'm sorry 12 orative 122 good i' move this up that'd be X to the2 DX cool deal let's keep going so this will be our limit as X as C approaches zero from the right of let's go ahead let's do our integral what's the integral of x to the2 tell me that one okay X to the2 I like over2 so basically two so you okay with that integral um I'm going kind of have to warn you now I'm going to go fast through a lot of these integrals because the idea is no longer hey can we do integrals it's let's look at how to do these these improper integrals does that make sense to you so actual integration we're going to go a little bit quicker now do I still have an integration symbol here you've already done the integral so all we're doing now is evaluating where are we evaluating from9 okay which way 9 to C or C to 9 which one do we plug in first so this would be the limit as C approaches zero from the right hand side 2 < TK 9 - 2 < TK C still okay so far let's talk about these things let's talk about what happens as C approaches Z what's going to happen to this part how much is that going to go to sure this is three that's two so we're going to get six notice how we're stopping writing the limit once we evaluate the limit but before that we have to have it every single time now what happens to the square root of C as C approaches zero notice we don't have a two- side limit here which is why we had to go from the right hand side only it doesn't exist from both sides so just think about what happens what happens to a square root of a number as that number gets really really close close to Z it gets really close to zero does that make sense to you if you pluged in zero You' get zero so we'd have minus 0 therefore what's really so cool I don't know why it's so cool to me but it's so cool to me it says that what's an integral even mean so there's a definite integral right between 0 and 9 of something that's not even defined is zero yet what happens is that if I have the area because of this because of our limit idea the area under this curve from 0 to 9 is equal to very cool idea very cool CH all right with with this so there's a few scenarios I want to discuss with you let's say that we have so for a discontinuity at B for discontinuity at a [Applause] or for a discontinuity at some intermediate value C so let's say we have some function and there's going to be a discontinuity here an infinite discontinuity at B so our function is defined at a no problem it's going to do something I don't know what it's going to do but somewhere around B there's going to be an ASM toote do you guys see what I'm talking about the infinite discontinuity at B hello yes no I don't care what happens past it my interval is going to be from A to B I don't care what happens before my interval is going to be from A to B does that make sense to you so if I tried to integrate from A to B of some function then the idea is well let's look for the problem area let's look at what's what's wrong with our integral what's making it improper now clearly hopefully it's clear to you my integral is finite it's going from A to B it's not an infinite idea so I don't have to go to positive infinity or negative Infinity it's not a problem but what is a problem is that while a is defined B is not so my discontinuity would be where A or B so wherever that discontinuity is that's what we're going to call C or whatever whatever you want to do so uh you can call it any letter you want we typically use C because it's going to be an intermediate value between A and B does that make sense to you so for us we all right well well awesome so we'll have I'm sorry which one would we would we change here would we change A or B that would become a c so we'd say no no no no not B let's make some point C some intermediate value and then where are we going to let C go to we're going to oh not Infinity because I'm not going to Infinity anymore I'm going to go to B so the limit would be C approaches B now think carefully here so here's here's the idea one more time if I didn't cover this well enough for you the idea is you're going to have a problem with an infinite discontinuity it will either be at a or at b or somewhere between there I'll show you that one last if it's at one of your your end points of your interval A or B well then Define that endpoint as some intermediate value C so we go no we can't go all the way to there so let's go to here let's go to C not B does that make sense do our integral because now it's a definite integral that's defined from a to c do you got it after that we go all right well where do the C really want to go C wants to go this way a little bit C wants to go this way a little bit till it hits B now from which way from the left or from the right from the left from the left that would be the idea idea I want to show hands to see if you're okay with with this one now let's reverse it let's say that we have some function that has a discontinuity at a but is defined at B can we do it the way it is well no we have an infinite discontinuity the interval is great it's from A to B not a big deal so if we had an an integral that says I want you to integrate from A to B of whatever this function is where is our problem here is our problem at a or is our problem at b b a i mean a yeah it's at a B is fine right B is defined we're good to go so what we go is well um tell you what I don't I don't really care about going to be that's good good to know but I can't start at a if I can't start at a because it's not defined where am I going to start C some intermediate value C so my B would stay the same but my a would become a c what that lets us do again hopefully the last time that gives us a definite integral that we can actually evaluate it says now you're going from a finite number to a finite number that you can actually plug into your your integral when you're after you've already evaluated that's great we go okay plug in the B plug in the C subtract them good to go uh calculus tells us we can do that we can subtract that evaluation when we plug in B and then subtract off when we plug in a or sorry C in this case now the problem is well I'm not really starting at C I want to start where a I want to start at a so yeah this integral says from C to B but now this limit can take the C and move it which way to the right to the okay so let's just say two somewhere to where to a to a from the right side from the right side that's right that's actually the first example that we had that's right here they said okay I can't start at zero but I can start at C now at the very end we go okay look at that from C to 9 actually lets you evaluate it plug in the nine plug in the C that's great that's what different integrals are all about then it says well I want that c to not start here I want to start really close to here and that's what this limit idea says I want the C to start really close to here so towards Zero from the right hand side that's what this is show pants feel okay with that one now there's one situation we haven't covered what's the situation we haven't covered there a hole right in the middle holes I don't care about because that's why that's why they're called removable discontinuities they're not going to affect this um it's still B bounded correct so if we have a hole we can plug it with a single point does a point have any width to it that's is going to blow your mind if a point has no width to it then if I'm missing a point on my line so a hole basically since a point has no width it can't possibly have an area under that point does that make sense it's area is width times height if it has no width I don't care how high it is0 time anything is still zero so for that reason if I have a removable discontinuity that does not affect the area under the curve those points have no width crazy right what'll blow your mind is you can have an infinite number of those on your line and still get an area what anyway different class different class uh discontinuity at C so what happens if it's not hit did I just completely blow your mind like a mind grenade do you see what I'm talking about how that one point doesn't affect the area yeah that's so Neato because there's no WID so therefore we don't care we don't care about the holes we care when it's not bounded right because that's a problem we need to Define that a little bit better so it's not here anymore it's not here anymore it's somewhere in the middle so here's our a where we'd have something toed here's our B where a function would be defined but somewhere in here we've got a problem oh did I say infinite number holes I think I might have meant finite I'm not sure I don't remember anymore could be a finite number of oopsie that would be just a little bit of a problem uh there I don't know that exact thing well what's the issue here are we defined at our end points of our interval of at our end points A and B are we defined yes so then our infinite discontinuity doesn't happen here and it doesn't happen here it actually happens right in the middle whenever you get this case this is the worst case scenario this one's kind of nice cuz you just go okay it's one limit does that make sense to you one limit because we have one discontinuity from One Direction here no problem one limit one discontinuity from One Direction here one discontinuity but it's from two directions so whenever you have your infinite discontinuity between your bounds of integration the A's fine the B's fine somewhere in the middle we have a problem so somewhere in the middle we'd say okay where would we go where would we start from if I want to do this i' start at a where's my problem at c c yeah I have i at C I'd have to split that up then I have another integral starting from where and going to after you do this so basically here's the idea if you have it at one of your end points of your interval not a problem just call it from a to c or from C to B respectively and let's that c go to the appropriate number if it's in the middle you have excuse me you have to break that up so the starting point to where C is then C to where the ending point is where your ending interval is and then you do basically the above so basically do you guys see that this idea is a combination of these two ideas we'd get one of these and we' get one of these specifically this integral is this one this integral is this one and you do exactly the same thing makes sense are you sure you guys want to try a couple of them yeah okay probably let's do so any questions question what if it doesn't approach Infinity on both sides only one you can still try it has a point and then it comes down from what do you oh like a like a pie wise defined function like this one yeah that'd be great because this integral is defined so this would be like easy okay you say hey a to c no problem but then this side you still have to split it up because it's not continuous you have an infinite discontinuity hence the not continuity part okay so this would be good this part you say well I got to do this one here that's a good question so you just would skip the limit on one you wouldn't have to do it for the left side that'd be easy because it's actually defined that's a good question and any other questions what would the limits look like for uh the a to C and C to B it's easier to show you with um actual numbers but what you do is you call this an intermediate Point D and you say a limit as D approaches C from the left you'd say a limit as maybe e as e approaches C from the right so you'd have to have this is why I don't want to show you that many letters cuz like what in the world are you talking about here but youd go from a to some number D okay okay you do your definite integral and then you you let D go to C your undefined point from the left hand side here you to find some intermediate Point e you've already used C and D so e then you do your definite integral from E to B after that you let e go to C from the right hand side did you guys follow that same ideas it works easier with numbers because they don't have all these letters f around okay so let's actually get to the nuts and bolts of this [Applause] thing you know one of the most important things we can do as integrators of this these improper integrals is determine what we're talking about whether we have a an infinite interval or whether we have an infinite discontinuity which in this case do we have an infinite interval or an infinite discontinuity interval is great we're going from 1 to four that's that's a definite interval it's finite but within that 1 to four we've got a problem so you have to Define all the problems you have and there can be several of them you could have a problem at an end point you could have a problem at both end points you can have a problem at both end points and somewhere in the middle or several places in the middle now of course right now we're going to keep it kind of easy right there going be like one problem but you could have many many different problems does that make sense to you so everywhere your denominator is zero that's an infinite discontinuity provided you can't simplify out the uh it's not a hole basically um that you would get from calculus one the difference between holes and ASM tootes if you had me you should know that exactly what the difference is between holes removal discon ASM tootes so in our case uh where is our problem at four it's not a one one's great I can plug it in stop zero two three cool four h that's a problem so what we're going to do is we're going to say well you know what if it's not defined at four let's make it be defined somewhere at some intermediate Point C are you guys with me on this one that's uh which case is this is this the case for one two or three which case do we have one we have one we have this one it's it's uh it's fine it's defined at a it's not to find at B it's defin at one it's not defin at four so we're going to call this some point point right before the B right before the four we're going to call it C maybe it's 3.99 99999 forever I don't know what it is we're going to call it C and we're going to have exactly the same function we just have to say what's happening on my interval so we have to say where C is going so what how do we say what where C is going what are we going to use limit yeah limit is the way we say where a number's going a limit as C approaches where it's always going to be this number or this number or some number in between there it's always going to be a number so it's not going to be a random letter anymore okay we're defining what's happening to the C now you got to be good at this is a c from four from the right or four from the left left from the left so let's see if it matches up C is going to the top number from the left C's going to the top number from the left hey that looks exactly right can you do that integral it should be pretty easy what would you use in order to solve this integral yeah what would the U du = DX orative du = DX again I'm going to go kind of quick on this but don't do not uh neglect your substitutions okay your signs are important you guys see where the negative is coming from on that one no that's important okay so we have a limit as C approaches four from the left of integral from 1 to c u to the -23 * tell me what I can do here okay you can actually pull it all the way out front if you want to you can pull it in front of the integral it doesn't really matter U -23 du uh can you all integrate U to -2/3 how do you do that okay so we have our negative we add one we get 1/3 divided by what3 so divided by 1/3 so this would be 1/3 / 1/3 U to the 1/3 divid 1/3 no more integral we've already done the integral what's the 1/3 change to now we can evaluate right now from 1 to C or you could pull your -3 all the way out front I might choose to do that just to show you that it's possible so from here I can pull that -3 out in front of my limit and do U to the 1/3 from 1 to C now there's a big issue right now with plugging in the values what's the problem changing down we didn't change bounds so if you didn't change bounds instead of plugging into you what do you have to what do first we got to take this subtitution put it back so we're going to have to do -3 * the limit as C approaches -4 sorry four from the four from the left from the left hand side of what's it going to look like 4 - X3 okay so 10 20 second recap here we go we first identify what type of problem we have whether it's an infinite interval whether it's an infinite discontinuity maybe both of them look for all your problems here we're defined we're good to go here we're not defined at this number at that end bound end point of your interval we call that some intermediate value C we say Hey where's the C going well it's going to go to four from the left hand side we don't care about the right hand side that function is not even there we don't care we're going to evaluate our integral any way that we can we have lots of techniques to do that get all the way down to here and then oh my gosh well if you use the U substitution before you evaluate definite integral you definitely better plug back in your U so we have a 4 - x^ 1/3 now we get to evaluate so we've got -3 let's not forget that a limit as C approaches four from the left what goes in first the C or the one the C 4 - c to the 1/3 minus 4 -1 to the 1/3 this is the point where you can start to evaluate your limit notice we've had to write limit every single time till we get right down to here because we haven't thought about what's happening as C is approaching four yet so this right here look it this is your definite integral this is evaluated on your definite integral does that make sense this is where you say okay now what was happening C really wasn't just a number I wanted to stop at C was something I wanted to go to four from the left hand side does that make sense to you so let's see let's see about no pun intended let's see about the C uh what's happening to the C it's getting really close to four really close to four what's four minus something really I I mean really close I mean it get to four practically speaking how much is that so this thing is going to go to Z since C is going to four from the left hand side this thing is getting really close to zero 0 to the 1/3 is still zero so we're going to have don't forget about this3 it's still there so we have -3 * this is zero minus how much is this going to bebe Al together we have three cuot this part should be pretty easy show if F feel okay with with this stuff can we move on just a little bit okay so moving right along questions all gone already have I taught you what the integral of um lnx is have we done that in this question oh no it's the integral of 1/x not the derivative of L and X the integral of LX have we done that think we've done it once sorry U * V minus the integral of B du what am I doing up here magic magic I mean integration by parts U V minus integral of V duu this is one you know I I never missed those C's some did the wrong thing but I never missed those C's there we go we get x l and X - x do you guys see where the x is coming from it's just basic integration by parts I know we've done it at least one time before uh but what that means is that if I wanted to evaluate this limit from oh where do I want to go 0 to one of lnx DX now I can use this formula basically I wouldn't have a c but now I can use that so whenever you see the integral of Ln X if you want to memorize this that's fine integral of Ln x is by integration Parts X Ln x - x be okay with the integral I know I did it fast but we've done it one time before so let's look at the integral from this is our real example okay let's look at the integral from 0 to one of Ln X firstly is this an infinite interval or is an infinite discontinuity infin discontinuity very good where is the discontinuity zero one or somewhere between one one what's Ln of one Z then it's defined oops what's Ln of zero error sytax error syntax my calculator won't do it I don't know uh do you know what lnx looks like you better yes it's the inverse of e to X so if e to X looks like this l x looks like that now you all think that it's undefined at one because when you plug in one you get zero that's not something that's undefined it's actually defined the definition is L one is zero that's not a problem it's at zero what our problem is is at Zero from the right hand side that's our problem Ln is isn't even defined on the side not even defined at all okay so our problem here is oh your problem here I don't got a problem here I'm good all right but it's not at one one's good we're good at one we're not good at zero so help me out with it what do I call the zero what am I going to make it let make it c yeah I'm not making it a because I'm not letting this this uh this number go anywhere I'm not letting it go to infinity or anything I'm calling it C because I have a number between 0 and one right now does that make sense it's between Z and one now where do I want that c to go from the right I mean correct and a limit lets us do that I made a really big integral didn't I make sure you know that's a handed R quick show hand be okay with that one so far so one's good man it'd be kind of worst case scenario uh to pick the wrong thing right go oh this is completely undefined at one no it's not this is greater one it's not greater zero because it goes to negative Infinity that's a problem so we say hey 0 to one no no no call it a number c to one somewhere just before zero as we're going from the right just before zero do your integral because we have a definite integral now after that you go okay cool after you've done your definite integral where do we want the C to go now we want the C to go to Zero from the right hand side this is the idea do you get the idea are you sure you get the idea yes all right so now that I've shown you how to do this this integral no problem you got a limit as C approaches zero from the right the the integral of Ln X is X Ln x - x we do not need the plus C because it's a definite integral uh where is my bounds of integration from where to where which one do I plug in first very good so this will be a limit as C approaches zero from the right of C * Ln C minus C first I just check and see if you were paying attention I didn't even write the C's the X for some reason I don't know why one Ln 1 minus one very I even asked you that question didn't I silly old Leonard minus okay now we'll have C Ln cus C can you see why this is correct anyway so you all right with that so far now let's start simplifying this thing what happens with ln1 Z that's zero what happens with oh goodness ration you know what we're going to do one more thing with this so we know that's zero I'm going to rewrite this just a little bit I'm going to write this as limit as C approaches zero from the right of let's do this let's do1 minus C Ln c plus c are we okay with that so far hello yes no okay now you can't make up your own math on these things some are going to be easy little Parts some are not going to be so easy you have to do some things with it so let's look at this what's the limit of 1 easy what's the limit of C as C approaches zero from the right that's zero this one oh this is 0 * negative Infinity that's an indeterminate form of 0 time Infinity we'll have to rewrite that one you guys follow me on that one you can't do zero time you should know that Ln of C as C approaches zero from the right goes like this to negative Infinity you can't do 0 * infinity and know what that is without doing this okay you've got to actually go through are am I getting through to you a little bit okay you got to do the indeterminate forms like we've been prac that's why we did that just to get here so we're going to have this is still1 this goes to zero so I'll have 1 minus the limit as C approaches zero from the right of C Ln C and then well plus zero that's gone so really I just need to focus on this thing I'm going to take it off to the side here real quick use a different color here the limit as C approaches zero from the right if you remember anything about indeterminate forms like 0 * Infinities or zeros to the whatever we're trying to make a fraction out of it of 0 over 0 or Infinity over infinity explain to me why we're trying to make a fraction out of it to do very good so never want to move Ln to the bottom we found that out when we remember doing e to the Ln of the bunch of junk we never move the Ln we always move the other thing so this you leave this as Ln C over one over C which was the idea that you can but you're going to be doing a derivative right now now let's let's identify this uh what is um what is this as we go from this is infinity this is negative Infinity as we get really close to zero this thing's also Infinity if this is infinity over infinity we can use so this was Infinity over infinity a weird Infinity this was Infinity over infinity so with a lals rule I'm going to do lals really quick we get 1/ C over -1/ c s derivative of Ln C is 1 C derivative of 1 C Isa 1 c^ s are you guys okay with that one can you simplify that of course you can let's see it's going to be negative 1 C over 1 C sliate multiply C we get if you simplifly this you're going to get Negative C got it c c c c now what's happening are you are we really okay with oh can you see three different C's I see what you did there thanks so uh what's happening to our c as C approaches zero from the right this thing is going to negative Z well I don't care about negative Z zero so this whole thing is settled and we geta one crazy quick show hands feel okay with with that one are you sure so the idea is man you you can do all these integrals they're pretty easy uh be careful with how you set it up identify where the infinite discount nity is that's important if you can do that you get your correct limits okay after that math you can't cheat at your limits don't make up your own math do them the way I showed you with indeterminate forms okay uh really make sure that you know how to how to do those limits maybe refresh your memory on the section of indeterminate forms so let's do uh let's do two more we'll talk about one we'll actually do another see if you're really really with it here we're not going to finish this but I want to see if you understand what to do integral from1 to 1 of 1x^2 DX integral of 1 to1 of 1x^2 DX uh infinite interval infinite discontinuity neither both neither infinite interval infinite discontinuity is there a problem in our function yes where zero is a problem you see what what I'm talking about the zero zero is a problem this is what I'm talking about you can't just blindly integrate with definite integrals in calculus one you can because you don't cover this idea IDE you go okay I'm just going to assume I can do it but here you can't do that because now well can you plug in zero but goodness gracious folks we're going over an interval for where this function is not even defined what that means is that we have this third situation where we've got a -1 to 0 plus a 0 to 1 CH pant you feel okay with with that idea I'm not going to finish the problem for you I think you can do check it out ignore this side could you do this yes yeah this would be as C approaches zero from the left as C approaches zero from the right and then you do both of them add them together if they both exist thanks for the emphasis on that one okay last one I have 84% last one integral from zero to Infinity of that bunch of junk oh my gosh one of the most important things you can do is actually identify what is going on what is wrong with your interval or your integral or both of them so what's wrong with this picture infinity infinity right off the bat smacks you right in the face so boom got an Infinity that wake you up a little bit so that's an infinite interval we're going from zero that's zero is great all right well zero is great as far as the interval being defined to Infinity that's going to be a problem we're going to have an issue there does that make sense now there's another problem what's the other problem we're def find everywhere except at zero 1 2 3 4 boom boom all the Infinity is perfect except with a zero so here's how we and you can take these ideas and run with it okay I'm giving you kind of the basics here so if you had started like you couldn't start anywhere negative but like on example like this one if you had other scenarios you got to break them up to where your interval is defined and do limits for where you are not defined is that clear so in our case we're going to say not a problem no we can do this not a problem but here's how to split it up if you have an infinite interval we're going to have to have somewhere where we can start at a finite number and end at an Infinity for here for our our infinite discontinuity we're going to have to have somewhere where we start at zero for sure but we end at a finite number so what we're going to do here is we're going to split up our integral with some intermediate value that's relatively easy to plug in so you guys with me on the idea we know that we can separate integrals as long as they're well continuous or as long as we separate them make a discontinuity with our limits now so basically we can separate them anywhere we want to we typically will separate at the discontinuity if one exists I'm sorry if one exists between our our ending bounds of our interval however if we have no infinite discontinues between the bounds of our interval just pick a random number or pick one that's easy to plug in what number is easy to plug in between zero and infinity one one does that make sense add them together now tell me something now that you've broken it up can you do this integral this is proper it's definite interval here it's just undefined at that point so we could write a limit as uh what number is going to change real quick what number is going to change to uh one C third times a chart okay now where's that c going to go from the from the right from the right listen if it's a left hand bound you're going to have to get there from the right if it's a right hand bound you're going to have to get there from the left because there is no other side of that show fans feel okay with with that one do you guys see how this idea is the stuff that we literally just covered it is this all you got to do is break this thing up so now next one we're going to have a limit okay let's see if you remember this from last time the one's not going to change what's the infinity going to be [Music] b as B approaches e x over of X now be smart about this don't do the same integral twice two different times just do it once and use it for both cases okay so for us uh I'm going to really rip through this thing very quickly uh because I have about a couple minutes left and I'm I'm going to assume that you know how to do this you I guess you could have made that -2 let's do that so U is X get -2 x to2 move over the -2 of X du that is our DX bam square of x's are gone pull out a -2 our integral becomes -2 e to U so far so good now of course before I start evaluating this thing I'm going to want to make sure I have my function in terms of X and not U should be D not DX oh yeah thanks yeah thank you for that so -2 e to U -2 e to thex your P be located with that that one basic basic UB okay if you need to watch that again Watch it again now we've got both of these pieces so what we end up doing is once we've done this integral now take that idea and put it here so we have from uh from this side we've got a limit as C approaches zero from the right this integral is this -2 e x it's just that we're evaluating from C to one okay I really want to make sure that you guys get this idea are you okay that this integral is this piece and I'm just going from C to one yes or no yeah are you sure is everybody sure on that one it's a big deal so we integrate once and we use it twice because we're just splitting up the same integral so F feel okay with it okay fantastic now we're going to add on to it a limit as B goes to Infinity of well this integral is this piece only on this particular integral I'm going from 1 to B so we evaluate limit as C goes to Z from the right which one do we plug in first one -2 e to theun 1 - -2 e to theun see this minus this so I'm I'm doing the plus here do you guys see where the plus is coming from I don't want to BL out of the water but I got to go quickly here on this one so this minus a negative that gives us a plus you okay with that S I would have messed up little little piece negative I'll do it over here that bother you 2 e to < TK b - -2 e to < TK 1 here's what I'm talking about this is what we did here so when I subtract a negative what does this become ladies and gentlem okay now we're almost done tell me what is what's the of one 1 so this is -2 over e does that make sense to you -2 over e now what's happening to the C it's going to zero it's going to zero what's the square root of zero so look at this is getting really close to zero you with meun of 0 is0 is e to the 0 is so this goes to well e 1 e 1 is over e so -2 over e this is zero e to the 0 is one this is this gives us two guys with me on that one plus let's go to Infinity what's my problem this is right right yeah B comes first plug in the B then plug in the one B comes first uh what's square root of infinity infity still Infinity this is negative in oh think careful do you guys see what I'm talking about negative Infinity e to the negative Infinity is thanks for the The Sting y'all zer okay now how about this one uh sare one one negative what's e to the negative 1 what happens what's our what's our area so this was this this is two this is zero because e to the ne Infinity is z 0 * anything is zero this gives us this again Bam Bam we get oh my goodness this is crazy okay crazy so we we do all this work from Z where it's not even defined to Infinity where we're going forever of this function and because of our limit idea we figure out this area under that curve is Bam our last little bit of section 7.6 of this section is dealing with something that's a little bit of a kind of a nice application that we can use improper integrals use to Advantage with improper integrals here's the idea let's suppose that we know something about two functions specifically we know that if we compare two functions one is always greater than or equal to another graph on this interval or one is always less than or equal to another graph or function on this interval if we know that then sometimes we can say something about the convergence or Divergence of these integrals without even doing them did you hear that without even doing them and the reason why that might be nice is is because there's some integrals that we can't do there are some nonintegrable functions so if we compare them to some that are possible we can find out some nice things about it does that make sense to you let me give you a picture of what I'm talking about okay so let's say that I've got some function f ofx and I don't care what this function looks like it's just some function and it goes forever and I've got some function G of X and it goes now here's the thought process I'm going to try it's a very simple and what I have to write here is very simple um it's going to be like one little statement one little statement but I want to make sure that you guys understand the concept that's what this class about right understanding the concepts here so think about this for a second firstly do you see that f ofx is always greater than G ofx for any number that I give you from a and let's assume this goes like this forever okay from a to Forever are you guys with me always greater than or possibly equal to it let's look at it uh the black line is f ofx the purple line is G of X is the black line above the purple line is a black line above purple line yes how about right here oh it's equal right there does that matter no it can be equal to it that's fine as long as it doesn't jump above it that would be a problem but there always equal to it or less than at so would you agree that f ofx is always greater than or equal to G of X for any number from a to Infinity so fan if you understand the concept okay now here's a plan think about what would happen for these scenarios let's say that we take an integral of G ofx how you start with FX let's say we take an integral of FX from a to Infinity remember the improper integrals that we've been doing watch the video If you from the beginning if you don't remember that if we go on this indefinite interval from a to positive Infinity we go okay let's take the integral of f ofx let's say that we can find it so the integral of f ofx from a to Infinity is actually convergent remember convergent remember the word convergent means the area exists the limit exists so the area exists so we do this and we say oh you know what I can find here's the key thing so Focus right now I can find the area of f ofx from a to Infinity you get that therefore the integral of f ofx from a to Infinity would be called convergent now here's a thought if the integral of the black line is convergent what would that tell you about the integral of the purple line of G of X it has to be convergent if the big one converges this one's bounded it's bounded by this that's what this says it says that f ofx is the upper Bound for G of X it's bounded so if this converges this one has to it's like it's squeezing it almost like it's squeezing it down there does that make sense to you so it's it's bound by the x axxis and by F ofx well this is always above this if this one converges a smaller function would also have to it's like it's getting squeezed down even more show as you understand that one so that's what we're going to say here if this integral is convergent then so is this one if integral from a to Infinity of f ofx DF DX is convergent then the integral from a to Infinity of GX G ofx DX is also convergent I really do want to make sure that makes sense to you do you understand that concept so if the F ofx converges that area exists then G of X has to it's smaller than that question so G of X just can't go down forever or is do it have to stay above some point yeah we're going to assume that it's bounded by uh this but even if it if even if it isn't even it's not x-axis if this went down below it as long as f ofx is on top of it you can still do it does that that makes sense there the only condition we have to have this has to be above that what can't happen it can touch that's fine this the area the difference in area is between there for the interval where they touch is zero it just if it goes above that that's a problem does that make sense to you okay so now next one think about the backwards way let's say we know something about G of X let's say that we calculate the area of G of X and it's Divergent so that means that we go okay the areaa under here oh it keeps growing without bound or we can't find it what would that tell you about the area of f ofx or under F ofx we don't know we don't is it possible for the integral of G ofx to diverge and the integral of f ofx to converge no no if this one grows without bound uh remember we're saying this is bigger than that does that make sense if this one grows without bound and F ofx is always is bigger than that how can f ofx converge if G of X grows without bound it's not convergent so if G ofx is Divergent and we know f ofx is bigger than that so G of X goes mm can't do it f ofx is larger than that can f ofx also converge no so if G ofx diverges and F ofx is bigger than G ofx then integral of f ofx also diverges I used F ofx instead of integral of f ofx but hopefully you get what I'm saying if the area of G ofx diverges the area under f ofx is bigger than that it must also diverge so if the integral from a to Infinity of G of X DX is Divergent then the integral from a to Infinity of f ofx DX is also Divergent quick show hands if you okay with with that basically says hey if the big one goes somewhere to a specific number G ofx also has to do that it's kind of squeeze between them it's bounded if G of X goes to Infinity then F ofx also goes to Infinity that's the idea here sure you okay with it okay would you like to see an example you get one example here uh because they it's it's honestly just this idea but here's why we we would use this so let's say that I give you an integral from 1 to Infinity 1 /x + sin^2 x DX and again here's why you might want to do this integral from 1 to Infinity of 1x + sin^2 x DX um is there anything that you know that will take care of that integral for you uh substitution it's not a sub for sure because there's no cosine anywhere to be found up there it's not a sub it's not a bip Parts because you have a plus there it's not separable by product it is not partial fractions because those are not pols it's not a trick sub you can't complete the square with that and there's an X not an x squ no no there's nothing you know how to do for this integral some things you can't directly do some integrals you can't do so and I know that's a shock to you wait a minute this is math math sorry uh right here there's nothing that we know how to do for this integral maybe somewhere else numerically or approximations for sure okay there's other things that we can do but here no uh we can't do anything with this in our class right now so what in the world are we going to do well the most we could say about this is whether it is convergent or whether is Divergent that's something we could probably do here so we're going to make a comparison to another function that we do know how to do something with now we might not be able to find the actual area of this but we can tell whether it actually goes to a number or whether it doesn't does that make sense to you whether we should spend time trying to find it or whether it's a waste of time so here's what we're going to do we're going to compare this to another function something that is going to be easy to do now keep in mind that if we're going to do this we do have to keep the bounds of integration the same from here to here just so we we match this up so notice that our a and our a they match up perhaps we think of this we're going to try to compare it to that now here's how we're going to compare it now where did I come up with that well I'll show you in a second uh how I came up with that U but a lot of times when you're just learning this stuff it's going to be given to you it's going to say hey compare this function to this one just to get you guys in the habit of of seeing uh how to make that comparison does that make sense so it'll it'll typically be given to you all I would say like on one of my tests and say hey you know what um take this thing compare it to this so what am I doing here well I'm getting rid of at least the sign I'm trying to trying to limit that um also I'll show you why the sign gets limited to this and the X I don't have to change that at all I'll show you that in just a second okay but the idea is let's try try to find something that is going to contain all the time so be bigger than this function or all the time be smaller than this function uh let me show you so the first thing we got to do show one function is bigger than the other [Applause] we start with something very basic just the idea of what in the world these things look like are you guys are you guys with me so far on the idea at least hello yes no the idea of course is we've got to show this first that way we can make some determination as whether this is happening or whether this is happening does that make sense to you so we start with something very basic like like this um I know and my I know just from my trigonometry that sinx is is always less than or equal to one I know that don't you know that okay now here's what's interesting U if I Square both sides of this inequality should not change that inequality so what this implies is that if sin x is always less than or equal to 1 then sin squar x is also less than or equal to one when I square a number less than one or equal to one it gives you a number less than or equal to one does that make sense to you cool okay you sure you're okay with that one right cool well uh let's just do something really easy you know we can do anything we want to as long as we do both sides of an equation and same thing with inequalities unless you divide or multiply by a negative then it flips inequality around so what I can do basically say hey if this is true then what I can do is let's just add X to both sides so if I add X here and I add X here I'm going to get x + sin 2 x is less than or equal to 1 + X quick show hands if you can follow the algebra on that one now do you see you see the way I came up with this function now I thought I thought about like this okay um you know what sign sign's always less than or equal to one s squ is always less than or equal to one so I'm trying to build something from this one so I'm saying hey how can I make this function from here well uh hey that's that's bounded by one therefore this thing is bounded by one plus X that's the idea now of course what we're going to want to do is we got to reciprocate these two things put them over one if you do if you reciprocate your inequality if I do 1 over x + sin^2 x and I do 1 over 1 + x tell me what happens to an inequality when I reciprocate both sides do you know changing 2 is less than three I reciprocate 12 is greater than 1/3 the inequality the inequality puts [Applause] around we reverse that inequality does that give us the relationship that we want to see it tells us that yeah cool okay we know that something's happening here that one function is always greater than or possibly equal to another show fans feel okay with this one that's the idea you need it to be all the time so we always know that yeah these could be equal at some points but other points this is going to be greater than this function does that make sense to you you sure any questions or comments before we we go any further I need to make sure this you guys get with this okay so the first thing we show is that I don't know right off the bat whether one's bigger or smaller I do because I'm doing the problem okay but you we not going to know that right off the bat we got to look at and go okay how am I going to get this thing from this thing well figure it out figure out some relationships start small grow your function grow it to what this side is then compare it to what this side is well this one turned out to be always bigger than that so what are we going to try to show let's think about it if this thing please listen carefully and think carefully on this if this thing converges if this well actually this if this thing converges does it tell you anything about this thing yeah if this converges does it tell you about this here's a scenario it says Hey suppose that of X converges G of X is the small one if this converges could F ofx diverge possibly absolutely you you don't know so if this small function converges we've said nothing about the big function does that make sense Contra positively if the large function diverges does it tell you anything about the small function no no it doesn't this could easily diverge and the small function could converge what happens is if the big function converges the small one has to if the small function diverges the big one has to maybe watch that about 14 times till it actually sinks in there okay because that's that has to happen so in our case if this one converges nothing nothing got it if this one diverged nothing now of course we can't do this integral so we're going to do this one and then make comparison if this one diverges now think here if this diverges what's it tell you about this one that's where we can make the jump so we can only show one thing here if if at all if this converges it's smaller than this one doesn't say anything it says yeah your small function converges the bigger one is obviously bigger than that I don't know where the converges or diverges but if this diverges if the small one diverges the big one also has to does that make sense at least a little bit M okay so let's go ahead let's see if we can do this integral from 1 to Infinity of 1 1 + x DX now that's something we know how to do what would I do first you got to change your Li I would say this is an infinite interval as B approaches Infinity they can change it to 1 to b 1 over 1 + x DX yeah you can do the UB we're going to keep this pretty simple because we're pasted all this stuff um what this changes to is a limit as B approaches Infinity of Ln absolute value 1. X from one to B yeah of course you can do a UB on that one you say u = 1 1 plus X it be 1/ U absolute Val U plug in the 1 plus X before we start our evaluation show should be okay with that one let's evaluate so this would be limit as B approaches Infinity Ln 1 + B absolute value absolute value here really is not that relevant can you explain to me why the absolute value here is not relevant for us say what now be negative never our interval is 1 to Infinity we can't get a negative we're adding one plus a number that's positive okay so really here kind of irrelevant doesn't really matter minus Ln 2 quick head on if you're okay with where those numbers are coming from just some evaluation now let's think about it where's B going Infinity okay what's infinity plus oneing you're a little kid I hate you to Infinity I hate you to infinity plus one it's still Infinity stupid kids anyway so infinity plus one still Infinity what's uh what's Ln of I always argue with stupid I just I really don't I ignore the little kids just like they should be ignored that was a joke by the way totally love kids um that's right back to math Ln of infinity is so this goes to Infinity what's infinity minus something really small so this whole limit goes to so you tell me something tell me something now now that we've done this this integral is this integral convergent or Divergent diver now we think back to why we did this whole thing right here if this function is always bigger than this function let me go through this one more time if this had been convergent convergent just not but if it had been conver doesn't say a thing about that don't know inconclusive okay but if this is diverent this says that this area goes to infinity or we can't find it or something like that this area is infinity area of this what's tell you about that one it has to be so should we even bother doing this integral heck no I know that if I did it if I was able to somehow magically do this right now our limit would also go to Infinity since this function is always bigger than this function the area under this curve is always bigger than the area under that curve so this is diverent this also has to be Divergent so that's infinity plus bigger infinity plus I don't know it doesn't matter it's still going to be Divergent what I want to know if is that stuff made sense to to you guys are you sure are there any questions about that at all question so this is just telling you if it's convergent or diver that's right it's not telling you what the area is so had we gone the other way right had this one been this pretend we were able to do this okay had this been convergent it would tell you that this would be convergent but it wouldn't tell you what that is yeah okay it say it's probably smaller than this area so if this comes out to a number you go cool it's probably smaller than that but uh I don't know what it is make sense question uh will you specifically ask us for that on an exam if you will use the convergent test to see if these are divergent or convergent sure I would say U use the comparison test or compare this to another function I probably would even give you the other function okay okay 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 8.1: Solving First Order Differential Equations By Separation of Variables
now we're moving on I think I told you before that we are going to do a little bit of differential equations right now this is not a class on differential equations this is a basic basic introduction uh some people ask me what are the applications to difference equations why in the world would we even use them I'm going to show you some of that right now what you need to know is that differential equations do have very far-reaching applications if you ever going into any sort of engineering uh so any branch of that you're going to be doing different equs for rest your life yay for you of course there are entire classes on differential equation several classes on it uh we are going to talk about one specific type of differen equations the easiest the most basic thank goodness for us uh separable differen equ separable separable differential equations so um here's what I'm not going to write all of this stuff down but these are kind of important little topics here side notes I said those are a better way to say it uh firstly a differential equation is a derivative with some unknown factor in it that we some something that we don't know um the order when we say uh differential equation of the order the order is the highest derivative that occurs so if we have a first order differential equation then we only have a first derivative in that differential equation does that make sense we had a second order that would be a second derivative in there did you guys get the idea so when we say order I will write this down so the order of a differential equation is the highest derivative that occurs in the equation let's let look right now at some first order differential equations tell me again what first order is going to mean for us just going to have the first derivative up there so first derivative and then then the function itself so here's a simple way to look at it here's a simple way to look at it that right there is an example of a very very basic first order differential equation uh do you see what if there's a is there a derivative up there I see a derivative do you see a derivative what's dydx stand for what type of derivative the first hey look at there first derivative it's an equation it's equal to some function of X are you guys with me we've basically been doing differential equations this whole time and say hey here's a function equal here's a derivative equal to a function can I get back the function of Y well absolutely if I wanted to find what y was equal to I would just have to integrate F ofx DX does that make sense to you well that's we've been doing integrals this whole time anti-derivatives uh we've been solving some very basic first order differenti of equations so differential equation of first order says youve got some equation this is an equation it has at most a first derivative in it actually it has exactly a first derivative in it solve that first derivative solve it for whatever the function is this is the idea here so be okay on the basic basic idea now this is very simple of course you really get more advanced in this now the problem is here if you don't already notice this this uh this only works for functions that are completely in terms of X doesn't it so this was pretty easy when we had integral of something with X but if I had integral with something of X and Y well that would be a problem wouldn't it what in the world would I do then well we're going to discuss that right now on these differential equations so this this is a problem because this would only work for functions in terms of X only so good only for functions of x which is exactly what that is what if we had functions in terms of both X and [Applause] Y we'll consider this if we did that what we what we would be doing is we'd have a derivative and we'd have a function with both X and Y in it so we still have a first derivative hey look at that is it still a first order differential equation let's walk through it uh does is it an equation does it have a derivative yes what type of derivative so this would be a differential equation of the first order does that make sense to you that's all this means guys it's an equation has a first derivative in it now problem here is that well we're going to have some function with both x's and y's in there that's going to be an issue we're going to have to deal with and that's what why these separable differen equations are going to be quite easy for us I'll show you them in a minute um I'm hoping that I don't intimidate you too much with the vernacular before we actually get to examples you're going to find out that they what we're going to do do here is not super hard it's going to take advantage of all the stuff we've learned all right uh so don't let it intimidate you right now just kind of stick with the the theory behind it what's going on um we will get there eventually well then a solu solution would be this a solution would be well it would be some function y of X so we treat y as a function of X you remember implicit differentiation you guys remember that how sometimes we don't know what Y is explicitly but we still know it's a function of X that's kind of the idea here is that we're going to be solving for y as a function of X even if it's not explicitly defined so a solution here would be something that when I take a derivative of it it gives me back the function that I want here y = y of X is our solution So based on you know I should this on some interval so in other words yal y ofx means it's a solution because when I take a derivative of y ofx it gives me the specific function I'm looking for f of x sub y oh sorry X and Y that's that's the idea here now would you like to see an example real quick okay I think that's probably a good idea to clear all this this stuff up right now I'm not going to show you how to do your differential equations I'm going to show you how to check whether one's a solution or not so show that Y = X + 1+ c e x is a solution to Y Prime = y - x on negative Infinity to Infinity well golly G how in the world are we going to do that well first thing first things first do you understand that uh y Prime is the derivative with respect to X of Y do you guys get that okay or Y Prime is the derivative with respect to X of Y of X because they're they're basically the same thing that's what we have over here y equals y ofx well here's what we're going to do then what we're going to do is we're going to take a derivative of this thing this would give us a y Prime what we're going to see is if when we take a derivative of this thing it matches up to this thing that's basically all it is it's saying take a derivative see if it matches right here you guys with me on this one so let's start off with Y = X + 1 + c e x can you tell me what y Prime is do you guys know how to take some derivatives of course you do so what's the derivative of x what's the derivative of one perfect can you do the derivative of C * e x do you need a product rule for that c a Conant C is a constant no no so plus what so what now c x it's perfect that's exactly right you guys okay with this so far you sure so right now we have two things we have y Prime = 1 plus c e x that's coming from this guy and we have y Prime = y - x at y - x well let's see about this what we know can I can I kind of take a little bit of these few things and move them together for you check this out what we know is that y Prime now you know I'm start this way I'm going to say Y = X + 1 + c e x true okay if I subtract X from both sides oops If I subtract X from both sides here I get y - x what do I get here those would be gone one they do you see it do you see that it works right now it says well look at this this right here this was our y Prime that's what we started with this right here this is our other y Prime so basically what it says is I'm going to have arrows everywhere and I'm sorry about that I hate all the arrows but that's where it's coming from uh here's the idea the idea says well check it out if I take the derivative of this thing with respect to x what I ended up getting was this agreed if I look back at my function and I subtract X from it look back at my function and subtract X from it that gives me this y - x oh look at that my y - x is equal to my y Prime that's was our initial our initial expression up here well but also if I subtract X from this side I get 1 plus c e to X which is my y Prime from when I took my derivative Bas of it says the derivative that you get when you I'm sorry the derivative you get when you take this this derivative is equal to what we're looking for it basically says that this is a solution therefore y = 1 + sorry x + 1 + c e x is a solution to this yeah a little bit more about the vernacular here guys have any qu you probably don't even know if you have questions on this I want to make sure that you actually get the idea the idea here was simply proving that when I take a derivative of this it satisfies this condition this is the idea do you guys understand the basic idea behind it are you sure it's probably brand new for you you haven't seen it so I would expect if you have questions now would be a good time anything at all have I explained it well enough for you to understand it and it wouldn't matter what C would be no and we're going to talk about that right now actually that's a good seg thanks for the segue anyone ever wants to buy me an actual segue that would be cool too I don't know why I did this because it doesn't do that it goes you just yeah you just lean do we get extra credit yeah yeah there's like a new leaner kind of seg leaner it's like it's no like it's like it's called Walking that is classic it's not as big and bulky I guess a leaner segue I like that joke that was funny whoever said that okay so where we at um here's the deal A first order differential equation will have a solution with one arbitrary constant this right here is an arbitrary constant notice how I could plug in anything to this thing and it would still satisfy that still going to work that's the idea so this will have a solution with one arbitrary constant C hence this is called a general and this is called a general equation sorry General solution so for us we'd say that Y = X + 1 + c e x is a uh look at this look at this with me for a second how many constants do you have one constant well sorry uh one arbitrary constant this this is a constant I know that I misspoke a little bit but this is a fixed con constant this one does not change how many arbitrary constants do you have remember that plus C you put the end of every integral that's an arbitrary constant doesn't matter what it is you get the same thing right this is an arbitrary constant there's one of them so this right here is a general solution to this differential equation now you might be asking the question at least I did the first time well wait a minute um if there's a general solution can you ever have a specific solution what do you think if the C was a number if the C was a number so if the to make the c a number we have to have what's called an initial condition U now if you've taken a calculus one class before which I know you all have you've seen basic differential equations with initial conditions the basic differential equations I gave you were these ones in calculus one uh where you just did an integral basically and then you plugged in your initial condition you're like wow this is really easy yeah it's designed of easy at that level so basically here's the idea we have this idea of a general solution which has your your your arbitrary constant in there if we want a specific condition so or particular solution we need what's called an initial value an initial condition um by the way the general solution gives you a family of these integral curves it's a family of curves just like when you add C to the end of a integral you get a family of curves that satisfy that condition this is the idea here so for a particular solution we must have an initial value initial values look like this this is from from your calcul one days it hasn't changed initial values look like this they say why when you plug in some X some specific X that's the X knot or X subz gives you some y sub Z value they're actually specified numbers so it says Hey y of 0 = 7 or y of4 equals whatever it's going to be something specific that you can actually plug in so let me would you like to see how that actually works okay let me show you that so this gives you basically this this is what this says this makes your differential equation pass through a given point I'll say this again what you're getting here I think I went through it a little quickly anyway the first time what you're getting here for your general solution is a family of Curves a family of these integral curves basically you can plug in anything to see can't you can't you and it'll give you a different curve at least that's that's how it seems to me if I plug in one or I plug in seven it's going to give you something slightly different doesn't it so General solution gives you a family of Curves if we want one specific curve listen carefully here please if we want one specific curve then we have to make it pass through a point one point this is the point do you get the point so what this do so what this does is this makes the differential equation pass through x sub z y sub Z it makes it pass through a point listen to this if I take a family of Curves this is a family of Curves right here if I take a family of Curves and say hey here's all your infinite number of family of Curves okay and I say now I want you to pass through one point it has to be one specific curve after that you have all these curves that go like this all these well it's going to hit this point only once you're not going to cross over otherwise it wouldn't be in the same family of curve curves so to satisfy this initial value you're you're limiting this to one specific solution one specific curve show hands if you understand the idea here now let's take what we just did what this whole thing did and apply this initial value to it I'm going to try to show you exactly how this works so first thing in order to solve these differential equations with initial values let's look at this uh just from what we know okay this this thing right here is called a what first okay look at it what is it first order first ordera differential equation this is a first order differential equation are you guys okay with that one what's this initial value exactly right that's an initial value so we have a first order differential equation and we have an initial value if you're going to solve a first order differen of equation you got have a solution to it a general solution you have to have something to plug numbers in we don't just start plugging numbers in now that doesn't make any sense okay what we do is we have our our general solution now for here for this differential equation we knew that Y = X + 1 + c e x is the general solution so we had our first order differential equation we already knew a solution was kind of nice right we just checked it you guys with me on this one we just checked it we know it's a general solution well now we're given an initial value here's where you use your initial value as soon as you have your general solution to your to your differential equation and you have your initial value can you plug these numbers into this yes yes you can so y = x x + 1 + c e x well you better tell me what the x is here for my initial value so y of 0 equals z what's the X there there only one number right so either way you you go you're not going to get wrong uh but which zero is the x is a zero inside or outside this is the X this is the Y so what's X become Z what's y become notice how if you have a function of x's and y's and you plug in everything that has an X and A Y your constant will be the only thing that you have left to solve for does that make sense that's nice that's why initial values tell you what your constant is what your arbitrary constant is so uh what's this become 0 plus 0 sorry that was wrong 0al 0 + one the one's not going to change plus what c e to Z sure so differential equation no problem got to have a general solution got to have something to plug numbers into if I'm giving you numbers here you got to have something to plug them into you're initial value says hey take these values for X and Y respectively use them in your general solution to solve for C to solve for that arbitrary constant let's see if we can do it y was 0 x was 0 x was 0 simplify it 0 = 1 + C C * 1 very good this is one so we're going to have C how much is c equal to can you take this and now rewrite your general solution except without C and instead of C put your number in there yes yeah that's exactly what I'm asking you for so look what look what this does okay try to explain this to you one more time a general solution is a family cures because you can plug any number into that okay it's going to give you a different uh curve for every single number you plug in if I want to go through a specific point it's saying now you're limiting that family curves to one specific family and to solve that for that specific family you need to tell me what the C is go he that c that c is the only thing that's giving you different curves ain't it the X isn't the one's not the E to X isn't the C is so if I can find out what my C is I can say that well now the specific solution not the general solution but the specific solution is going to be exactly what the general solution is but going through one distinct and if we do that we go from the general to the specific saying yeah I know family but no no no I want you to go through one point that gives me one specific curve show hands if you understood what we were talking about today cool next time what we're going to talk about I'm going to give you a lot more examples on what we're going to be doing with these differential equations we'll talk about how in the world to solve separable differential equations right now um let's not get ahead of ourselves we really haven't done much okay I've defined what differential equation are we've shown that a that we had a solution but it was given to you we actually didn't find that solution did we no we shown and then we talked about what an initial value was how if I have a family of Curves cool I I have that General solution but if I want a specific curve I've got to go through a solid Point fixed Point that's the Y Sub 0 equals z or Y sub y of x sub 1 = y sub x 0 y Sub 0 is a specific point limits the number we have to one what we're going to do next time again is talk about separable action actually how to find this thing so that this stuff is possible you guys okay with that all right so today we're going to discover what a separable differential equation actually is what they look like and how to solve these separable differential equations so firstly what in the world is a separable differential equation well really it's a differential equation remember we're talking about first order so with a first derivative it's a differential equation that can be written as a product of two functions so when we say separable it means that we can basically like separate the variables into a product so something times something else so this happens when the differential equation can be written as a product of two functions more specifically those two functions should be in one in terms of of one variable and the other in terms of the other variable so one would be in terms of say x and one would be in terms of say why [Applause] so when we talk about a differential equation yeah we're talking about an equation with a derivative in there when we're talking about first order differential equations that derivative has to be the first derivative when we're talking about separable differential equations we're talking about one of those first order differential equations for us where we can write that differential equation as a product of two functions one in terms of like X the other in terms of Y that's basically about it uh let me give you specifically what we're talking about if if we have a separable difference of the equation one of these two cases will be true either we can write it as dydx our first derivative is a function of X time a function of Y here's what we mean by separable separable means that do you guys see what we're talking about these two functions the ones in terms of X On's in terms of Y here we have a function of x times a function of why it's a product or if you do a little bit of math magic with this you can also get a different format or basically if we divide here multiply by DX over here and then subtract one from the other add one from the other we could get this a function of X plus a function of Y you can show that these two things are equivalent so I know I said a product of another but you should you need to know that you can take this and write it this way so we could take this by doing a little bit of math with it you can change this format into this format or vice versa show hands feel okay with these two two formats so this is what separable means basically says okay we have a function of x times a function of Y or we have a function of X DX plus a function of Y Dy just caught it I I like X's can't blame me d y right now we're not going to work with these things but I want to give you examples about what is separable what is non-separable okay so here's some some separable differenti of equations so if we take a look at uh these two examples if I were to give you x^2 + 1 DX + 1 y d y = 0 that right there would count as a separable differential equations you see that it fits one of these formats it's not the product one because we don't have a dydx equals something being multiplied together but it is this one it's a function of X are there any y's over here or any dys over here that's what we're looking for are there any x's over here or any DXs over here that's what we're looking for so that we can separate them into two different groups either by a product or a sum or difference you guys okay with that one this counts as a separable differential equation or something like this even something so basic As dydx and we're going to work with this one later equals K * y that right there is something that's uh directly proportional we're going to talk about proportionality in just a little bit one application of this well if you think about that we have what is this K why it's a product yeah it's a product so we could Define K as being a function oh you know what let me change this uh let me change this to a t because we're we're going to be relating this to time we could change this to K is a function of time where K could change with respect to time and Y would be some function in terms of Y so we could have two different functions out of this thing K being a function of time y being a different function with respect to another variable uh we're going to deal with this in just a little while but what I want you to notice is that these two things are actually separable difference equations all X's all y's a function of t a function of Y this is the idea show hands feel okay with the idea it's probably going to clear it up if I give you some non-separable as well so these are separable differential equations of course we have some ones that are non-separable so for instance if I had Dy DX equals that one something like that we have X Y2 right here look it separable or nonseparable separable for sure because it's x * y^2 no problem I can isolate my x's and my y's by doing just a little bit of division so basically I could divide over y^2 I could multiply DX over here and I'd have y's on one side and I'd have x's on the other side that's the idea that's what seable means we have we can get y's on one side x is on the other side quick head on if you're okay with that one so that's what you can do here if I just divided by y multip by DX or if I just added or subtracted one of these two things I'd have them on completely different or separate sides of my equation that's our separable differenti equations so far so good this one you can't do that with if I add a two if I add two well that's that's a problem I can't get these two things to to work nicely with each other or if I do something like this also not okay we have x's and y's together we can't separate those things show fans feel okay with with this you know what uh yeah there that's even more clear just so you know person I wasn't sure maybe made a tech on that uh definitely nonseparable so we have separable no problem we have nonseparable now what I'd like to do is do a couple examples of how to solve these things just so we get our feet wet with it so we're going to talk about right now how to solve our separable differenti equations so let's suppose we start with something looks like that how in the world are we going to do this well the idea is what we want is we want to have all of our x's and DXs on one side and all our y's and dys on the other side so basically if I have dydx = G ofx * h of Y well this right here this means it's separable because I can get all my y's on one side all my x's on the other side hence we can separate those variables so this is how to solve differential equations by separation of variables how would I move these things around what would I need to do to get all my X is on the right hand side and all my Y is on the left hand side what would I do just div by what take your take my P I want my x's on my right hand side sure so if I divide this I would get one over h of Y Dy DX equals GX we okay with that one now here's what's very interesting about this as soon as we have this our y's are on one side or X on the other side we can actually do whatever we want to an equation do you believe that you can do whatever you want to an equation as long as you do it to both sides what we're going to do is we're going to integrate right now on both sides of our equation with respect to X so we're going to have an integral 1/ h of Y dydx with respect to x equals the integral G ofx DX so maybe I can write a different color so you see what I'm doing here this same thing yeah we're going to integrate with respect to X X we're going to integrate with respect to X you see that I did the same thing on both sides what's interesting about doing this our DXs they're gone what that does that changes us into an integral of 1/ H of Y with respect to Y integral G of X with respect to X you guys okay with that so far now suppose that this is an integrable function if this is true what we're going to get here is we're going to get some function we're going to call it capital H cuz I don't know what it's going to be but it's going to be a different function because it's integrating remember doing that with anti-derivatives us capital letters from a long time back well if this is integrable then our integration is going to be H but is going to be a function in terms of Y you agree with that well this is going to be some function with respect to X plus some arbitrary constant that's basically how we're going to solve these things we're going to get all of our y's on one side we're going to get all of our x's on the other side and then we're simply going to integrate this is the whole idea do you guys understand the idea here let me do like a 20 second recap to make sure that we got this so the the brand of differential equations we're working with they're called separable they're called separable because they fit into one of these two categories saying I can group all my x's and all my y's on one side or the other they're not combined together when we can't do that where we can't separate our x's on one side and y's on the other you guys okay with that so far yes no okay so when we have this idea of separation solving by separation of variables we're trying to get our y's on basically left hand side x on the right hand side doesn't really matter the sides this is just nice for solving it later then we integrate on both sides with respect to the same variable hence X here after that if this is an integrable function we can do this we can do this we have arbitrary constant and this would be a solution to our differential equation this is the whole plan now do you guys want to see this in action some actual examples here yes I'm guessing that we do CU this is I it's well it's clear to me but hopefully it's clear to you I know it's a little vague though we haven't really done anything yet so let's start any questions or anything at all okay so first one let's look at dydx equal YX you know the first thing we got to do is make sure this fit fits our category so let's see is it an equation oh yeah clearly is it a differential equation is it a first order differential equation what tells you it's a first order differential equation yeah it's what type of derivative hence we have a first order differential equation is it variables that can be separated do we have a separable differential equation where we can get our x's on one side and our y's on the other side all by themselves yeah very good it's it's a product really is a product of a function of y * a function of x if you think well minute that's a quotient all quotients are kind of products right because you just have y * 1 / X and you have yourself a function of y * a function of X now how would we get this to be the way that we want it I want my Y is on the left hand side when my X is on the right hand side what would I have to do if I divide by y that would work just fine so divided by y I get 1 over y Dy y DX = 1X not bad are all my functions of Y on one side and my function of X that's on the other side right now would be a perfect time to do what with this do you see why we have to have our integration techniques before we start this stuff because to undo a derivative well think about that to undo a derivative that's an anti-derivative that is the idea of an integral so our separation variable works really nicely because when we separate our variables on both sides we can integrate the left we can integrate the right and it undo this derivative this is the idea here it basically gives us back the function we're looking for so if hands feel okay with the basic idea so let's integrate both sides so if I integrate the left hand side it's going to be 1/ y Dy DX and then what what goes over here remember all those times that your instructor said you got to have the DX you got to have the Dy you got to have all that stuff you got you do have to have that it's really not a trivial thing you have to show me what you're doing what you're integrating with respect to because when we do this here we have to see that we've done the same thing on both sides of our equation otherwise we mess our problem up that's not that's not fun to mess our problem up here so what happens on the left hand side what are we going to havex is canel so we're going to have integral of one over y Dy we're going to have integral of 1 /x DX oh this is interesting one y Dy 1X DX do we know how to do those integrals okay everybody what's the integral of one y Dy of what perfect and what's the integral of 1x DX done plus c ah why don't we have two plus C's should we have a plus c over here as well you can but it just all goes together and that's right if it's an arbitrary constant it could be anything right so if I have a plus c from here and I have a plus c from here if I just subtract that I'd still have a plus c it'd still be some sort of a constant a constant plus or minus the constant is a constant you guys okay with that you sure I said constant a whole bunch of times uh so I'm going to put plus C but I'm going to do this with it I'm going to be a little bit special um the good special I'm going to write plus C1 and here's why we're going to do that we're going to be manipulating this for a little while and what we can do with our C here the idea is what we can do with that we can change it around to make it as long as it's still a constant value whatever we basically want to so it fits our our our solution better so here's the things I'm going to do with this the first thing I'm going to do first are you guys okay with this this far this is pretty straightforward right kind of an easier one first thing I'm going to do I'm going to let C1 equal Ln e to C1 I want you to verify that that's actually possible do you remember that's possible it's kind of arbitrary thing right uh any number equals Ln of e to that number because Ln and E well they they simplify out there that's a they're inverse functions of each other therefore this would also equal C1 by definition that's that happens you guys okay with that one now the reason why I'm doing this I've got an Ln here right I've got Ln here right I don't have an Ln here but I want one I want one because if I have one then I can use e to the Ln on both sides if I can combine these two things so my plan is well if that doesn't have an Ln I'm going to make it have an Ln then what I'm going to do is I'm going to combine these two LNS after that I'll have Ln over here I'll Ln over here I can take e to both side well both sides as an exponent on E and get rid of my LNS does that make sense to you guys so my plan is I'm trying to put these two things together let's work with our Conant in a certain way that we can do this now in order to put these together a little bit further I can't just have Ln of e I've got to have this absolute value up here too so I'm going to put my absolute value here now you can notice that this is a true statement because e to any power is positive anyway my absolute value is kind of trivial but it's going to allow me to combine these two things so P feel okay with with this one are you sure so this is the one spot you can't put plus C at the very very end that's right you kind of have to have breadcrumbs on what you've done with your constant um so some people do some people cheat just go ah plus C at the very very end but we we have to really know what's going on here sometimes it really doesn't matter so this is like our breadcrumbs what we've done to change our constant here the hard part is honestly not the integrals that's pretty easy uh it's it's figuring how to put this constant in there uh so that we get one nice solution with one arbitrary constant I'm going to do a couple of things with this are you okay with it I don't really like the look of this so here this is things we can do too I want to show you all this stuff you're like oh you can actually do it yeah you can well instead of having e to the C1 I'm going to let C2 equal e to the C1 I don't like this part of it it looks really funny to me and so here's the thing you guys all agreed with this one right well C1 equals Ln of e to C1 absolute value doesn't really make a difference is this still a constant is to a constant still a constant number well then I'm just going to call that a different constant notice how I'm using the the subscript now of C2 to say well it's not I don't want C okay because C that's what we're going to end with we're going to end with the c if I start with a c and end with a different C it's going to look funny so I call the C1 saying hey I'm going to change it okay I'm going to change it to a C2 saying this is not my final C but it still stands for a constant does that make sense to you guys are you sure okay so then what happens is that C1 now would become Ln absolute value of C2 this is what I want to use here so Ln absolute value Y no problem Ln absolute value of x no problem plus what's C1 what am I going to use there you are absolutely right sure so we say hey C1 no not so good I need an Ln I also need absolute value so it's changing C1 becomes Ln absolute value of e to C1 no problem is this still a constant yeah it's still a constant no big deal is this a constant sure let's call it a different constant we're saying let's define basically let's define C2 to be e to the C1 is still a const we're fine as far as our notation goes therefore C sub 1 equals Ln of absolute value C sub 2 we're going to write that right here the reason why we did this is do you know how to put Ln plus Ln together multiplication yeah very good and since we have absolute value times absolute value we get to multiply those things together so this becomes Ln absolute value of y equals why don't you tell me what it is Ln uhhuh absolute value absolute value X2 X C2 okay I like it x * C2 we know that plus means a product within one Ln so two LNS being multiplied together same base we can sorry added together we can multiply the product of these two arguments since they absolute value make one absolute value out of it click show hands you okay with that one I'm have to move over here so now we have Ln absolute value of y equal Ln absolute value x * C sub 2 can you tell me the next step that you guys would do if you had this problem what would you do say what now very good we'll take this and treat them as exponents upon e on both sides of our equation so you know that's what you do right every time you have Ln on both sides you go wait a minute I don't like Ln on both sides I want to do e to the Ln of absolute value of y and I want to do e to the Ln of f Val x + C * C2 what happens to that e to the Ln what happens so we get absolute value y still equals absolute value of x * C sub 2 are we still okay with that one is this where I want to do yeah where I want do this now I want you to think about something here uh the definition of what absolute value actually means I'm going to take a little side step so that hopefully you get the next part if the absolute value of y equal x what we end up getting is that y could equal postive x or y could equal x that's the definition of what absolute value is it could equal an absolute value equation is so sayy you know what if you have an absolute value something equal to a number here or whatever we can have well the inside P equal positive X absolute value keep it positive we're done or if we had Negative X absolute value of negative would change to a positive in either case these would both be true we get those two solutions for an absolute value so should be okay with that one we're going to write this just a little bit more simply then so we would say y would equal positive or negative X does that notation work for you guys doesn't matter it's it's absolute value says you can have either a positive or negative and that absolute value will keep that exactly the same whether it's positive or negative you guys with me using that logic over here this lets us drop our absolute value so what this says is okay well then if I have absolute value of y equal absolute value of x * C2 we'd have y = x * C2 for sure but we could have positive or negative and it would still work for us so y can equal positive X or negative X y here can equal positive x * C2 or x * C2 sure F you okay with that one are you sure and that would get rid of both sides of the that's right that's right uh when you're doing absolute value equations we just need to treat one side as being positive or negative that there's really only two cases there's the case where the signs are the same both positive or both negative doesn't matter absolute value would change those negatives both into positives or the signs are different one's positive one's negative doesn't matter which which uh which side they are on so we don't need all four cases we just need two here's the two cases where they're both positive and where the or both negative and where the signs are off by one that's where we have the plus and we have the minus that's a good question any other questions about that before we go on you see we're almost done very close to done because multiplication is commutative we could do plus or minus C sub 2 * X you with me and here's the last thing as soon as you get it down to here where you have this nasty gobbly G up here this is what you define to be your arbitrary constant see here's the thing if I have positive c sub2 c sub2 is a number yes it's a number like three or I don't know what it is but it's going to be some number we could have positive C sub 2 or we could have negative C sub2 either way this is going to be a constant value does that Mak sense to you this is what we're going to Define to be our C so at this point we say hey let's let C = plus or minus C sub 2 if we do that that's an arbitrary constant and what that is is our solution to that particular differential equation that's called a general solution because we have that one arbitrary constant so we work with it no problem get your variables on one side or the other all y's all X's integrate that's how separation variables works not a big deal we all know how to integrate this class after that it's really working to figure out how you get rid of Ln see if you can solve for y explicitly and this is the plan for us if you can solve for y explicitly I expect you to do it can you always solve for y explicitly no sometimes you can't we're going to deal with a couple of those where you can't I'll show you what to do in those cases uh by sance you feel okay with with this idea feel okay with the content usually that some for some people that really throws them for Loop like what in the world are we doing well honestly it's just it's deal with a constant making sure that you fit it into your equation so that you can you can solve for your y so you can get your y by itself um as long as you don't make this into a variable or something you'd be fine so call this a different constant yeah it's a little different C2 equals e C1 no problem then we have all the way down to here take that plus and minus with our C2 call that your constant your arbitrary constant and we solve our problem and we don't ever have to go back and substitute it and find C1 again after going through C2 C3 or no if you do it this way if you do this correctly even with initial value problems you don't have to do that this is why we this is why though you have to Define it properly because otherwise you're going to be off by some things sometimes all right so no we we typically don't have to go back and and say what it was but you should be writing this off to the side like I don't want you to go all the way down to here and then go okay bam and not do not show me any of this stuff because that would basically be impossible right to just arbitrarily call it call this something but you got to Define it somewhere of what you're doing with your C1 or C2 can we try another example it's ready for it let's do this one what you think separable non-separable nonseparable is it a product of function of x times a product sorry times a function of Y yes always be you're the teacher you tell me I'm the teacher trying to get you to understand is that the same as what I just wrote on the board is that a product of x times a function of Y yes then that a separable differential equation even though it looks bad it's still a product of a function of x times a function of Y get the Y on one side and get the x's on the other side what are we going to do here so in our case we'd have one I don't want to lose you on this stuff do you guys see how to make this into a separable differential equation just right over it's just a product we have 1 over y dydx = x x^2 + 1 and that's it you okay with this one hello yes no are you sure do you guys see what I'm talking about being separable here separable means you can get all the x's on one side and a function of Y uh sorry all the Y's on one side and a function of X on the other side sure you okay with it let's keep going what's our next step let's do it sure let's integrate both sides not a big deal we can totally do that can you do both integrals sure this should be the easy part my goodness it's I'm not even kidding this is like the easy part of doing this not not even a problem uh let's let's move a little quick on this one what's this integral please Len what abue ah very good can you do that integral yeah is it a trick sub no make it easy on yourself what is it UB absolutely UB so Uub says that you would be what perfect du = 2x DX du/ 2 = x DX hey that's this right here not a problem so this would become the integral okay yes very good okay so one over U du over two see if I did that right did I do that right this is now our U okay I got that one uh X DX becomes D over2 no problem so 12 Ln absolute value U and now what change it back to X got to change it back to X I'm G do that right here so 12 Ln absolute value of x2+ one awesome and then plus sure C1 let's do C1 yeah let's do C1 okay you P feel okay with that so far good you should right because these are some very basic integrals um also if you want to be a little fancy about this and be like well you know what I know that this has an Ln and I know that this has an Ln and this one doesn't you can do things like this and go let's just call this Ln absolute value C1 let's just do that it's still a constant you see what I'm talking about you can do that if you want to go okay hey it's plus some constant I don't care what it is you might be you might do this if you want to be super notti I think I just made up a word uh but super notti about it and just go well then call this C2 if you really must then C1 would equal Ln absolute value of C2 does that make sense to you then you'd say okay well cool you'd have your C1 initially you'd say C1 C is equal to Ln of C2 second C and then just call that uh no still be oh sh I miss how we do it the first time this would be e to the C1 C2 E Yeah C2 = e the C1 C1 = Ln I know C so we go okay C1 now equal Ln absolute value C2 and you could Define it that way if you want to it's the same thing we've done before um do I need to explain that further for you are you guys okay with that one hon I don't want to blow anybody out of the water right now honestly are you okay with it so you start with no yes no some people are no but they don't want to admit it because you're like uh I have no idea what you're talking about right now let me go through it one more time do you understand that this integral is Ln absolute value y do you understand that this integral because we already did it is 12 Ln absolute value of x^2 + 1 yes no yes no okay okay and what do you always put at the end of your integral only here you're going to Define it a little bit differently it's going to be C sub one because we will be changing it how you define this well depends on what your equation looks like if I have an Ln here and I have an Ln here I'm probably going to want to combine this to one Ln if that's the case then we need to go through that process and say well this is definitely equal to this that's an arbitrary statement if you let C sub 2 equal e to the C sub 1 then this piece fits here C sub1 = Ln absolute value C sub 2 and this substitution is what we would make for the C1 the only reason why we're doing this is so that we can fit our Ln together so we can make this one expression in terms of a natural log an argument natural log show hands if that made a little bit more sense that time okay so Ln absolute value of y equals 12 Ln absolute value of x^2 + 1 plus Ln absolute value of C sub 2 yeah perfect now there's one thing you got to know about combining logarithms and the order in which you do it it's very important that you get this order I know on from your first test some of you don't have this order down do I combine my natural logarithms right now that's impossible the reason is because well it's not just a natural log plus natural log it's 12 time the natural log plus a natural log what do I need to do first the half the half's got to move in order for you to combine these logarithms by a a sum so this plus here this has to be gone what's that become so this would be a power of 1 12 what's a power of 1/2 that's a square root right there so then we have Ln absolute value y equals Ln absolute value square root x^2 + 1 plus Ln absolute value C sub2 have to move over here again so Ln absolute value Y no problem that's been there for a while now tell me what we get to do here after we move up the 1/2 so 1/2 is a power no problem 1 12 has an exponent exponent of2 is a square root what do we get to do now because we Define this we get to move our LNS together as one Ln so Ln absolute value of what time okay very good make sure we don't do something silly here please don't do something silly here don't do something like this oh yeah plus means plus y don't do that I'm begging you please don't do that your Ln rulle say no no no plus product and absolute value quick head down if you're okay with with that one so far you sure okay now what are we going to do come on now what are we going to do think back to the last example now what are we going to do power kind of yes raise both sides as a power upon e so we have these we go wait a minute I know I know as soon as I have an Ln equal to an Ln this is a beautiful thing this is exactly why we did all this stuff is to get an Ln equal to an Ln because if I have that I treat both of them as exponents of e nice what happens when you take e to an Ln power everything magically disappears and this becomes absolute value y equal absolute value of < TK x^2 + 1 * C sub 2 Okay show pans if you can make it that far on your own feel okay about that one is it going to take you some practice yes yeah probably is it making sense right now though for you yes are you sure are there any questions about this at all it always makes sense in class it does make sense in class I know usually typically I want to make sure that this does make sense for you though so I don't because if I'm losing you here I'm going to lose you on the next stuff we're doing I don't want to do that you guys get the idea of changing your constant how it doesn't really matter because we still have a constant you call whatever you want right you guys okay that we're doing that so that we can combine our Ln yeah yeah we're doing that because if you can combine your LNS to one Ln and another Ln and ex treat those as an exponent of e on both sides and we eliminate our Ln that's that's great we have just the argument equals the argument and now it's time to get rid of our absolute value you don't stop here you don't just drop your absolute value and call it C for some reason you got to show me what you're doing right so what we're doing here is we know that absolute value by the definition I gave you over here absolute value of y equals absolute value of something else is either plus this thing or minus this thing positive or negative would still give us the same answer because those absolute values will take care of those different cases for us where our signs are the same both positive or negative where our signs are different one positive one negative does that make sense to you see so think back to the last example we did EX the same now last little bit what are we going to do here cuz I don't like this I don't like this at all I don't like this what are we going to do plusus to the c c instead of C2 so plus or minus C sub 2 < TK x^2 + 1 no problem I know how to do that true or false this right here no matter what I give you positive or negative and whatever C2 is true or false it will be a constant true call that call that your arbitrary constant so let c equal plus orus C sub two do you see pun intended uh why we use C1 to start with because we're going to end with a c does that make sense if we use C here this would be off so we we want to call it the same thing because it wouldn't it's not the same constant it's a different constant I don't care what it is because we can change this to whatever arbitrary concept we want to so this could change whatever arbitrary concept want to but it is a different technically constant so we have y = cunk x^2 + 1 and this is our general solution to our differential equation notice how General Solutions have how many constants in them one constant because I can combine all of them that's the idea so fans you feel okay with with this one we're going to start one more I don't know how far we're going to get on onto it but I want to give you an example of an initial value problem like a re real one one that you get beyond your your Calculus one class so let's solve this initial value uh differential equation and see how it differs a little bit from what we're doing we'll see some of this stuff come into play okay it looks kind of nasty let's see about this um what is this thing called initi do do I use it here this is basically used look at the board when you get to here this is where you use it you define all the stuff all the C's and stuff so that you can use it here without a problem this is the idea right so our plan for this problem deal with your differential equation make sure it's separable make sure that you can actually do it and then at the very end we're going to use our initial value with it so we're going to ignore this for a second we're going to look right here at this thing is that a separable differential equation yes if you can make it to a product times a product oh sorry not a product that's silly if you can make it a function of X time a function of Y or you can get all your xes on one side and all your y's on the other side and be able to do those integrals then yes that's separable so for us let's start with what would I do move the the Yus one to the right side I'm I might choose to leave this one on left for reason I might choose to move this one over very good so we'd have y^2 -1 Dy equals yeah y e x DX you guys okay with that one so far yeah furthermore keep on going what am I going to do now y yeah so if I do that or leave the it doesn't really matter as long as you get the Y over here in fact I might choose to leave the the negative on that side what now yeah you can Mo the DX to be really proficient with our our variables here and what our our notation is you can move your DX right here now naturally everybody's going to know that if you do that and you integrate you're going to put a DX right back over here right and this DX should be gone so if you don't want to show that I don't know if I showed it on mine uh yeah I did I showed it CU I'm I'm really to the by the book on most of this stuff so yeah I would probably move this over here and show y^2 - 1 y Dy DX = e x yes now we do what inte so if we do we'll integrate with respect to DX or S with respect to X we'll integrate with respect to the same thing DXs are gone integral y^2 - 1 y d y = integral e tox DX let's keep on rolling what are you going to do now let's do the easy one first can you integrate this side that's a piece of cake what's integral of netive e tox DX I love integrals of e tox so we know on on our right hand side we're going to getx what's going to have to happen here what is this how would you guys do this one don't make it harder than it is you sub would not work Y is on the denominator it's not on the numerator split it into two split it into two fractions very good because if you do that if you split this then what this becomes is the integral of look at this look at don't make it harder make it easy this is what you learn in calculus one is to if you don't know how to do it directly you try to separate the fractions this would be y - 1 y you guys okay with what I'm doing there actually what Charles was doing there he says Hey separate it we got a numerator with two terms on it denominator one we can always separate that fraction have y^2 over y y^2 y is y - one over y - 1 one no problem can you do that integral can you do this integral piece of cake let's do it together and then we'll we'll come back to this problem just a minute okay so what's the integral of uh y minus perfect equals we'll do one more step and we'll call it good and then after that we'll um you know we're almost you guys want to hang out for like a minute and finish this thing yeah okay one thing I'd probably do here I'd probably multiply everything by two I'd do that to get rid of that2 just to make it look nicer so if I multiply everything by two we're going to get y^ 2 - 2 Ln absolute value of y = -2 e x + 2 C1 I want to make sure you guys are good with with that one are you good with that one sure you're good with that one okay next thing we'd probably do um well probably move that too so we'd get y^2 minus Ln of y^2 = -2 e x + here's where we we start doing little substitutions if you have 2 C1 2 * a constant is still a if you want to Define things like C2 = 2 * C1 that's absolutely fine then this now becomes plus C2 so integral no problem integral no problem plus C1 okay cool multiply everything by two just to get rid of this fraction we got y^2 - 2 Ln y = 2 and then plus 2 C1 that 2 C1 call that a different constant just to make your life easier does it matter not really but it makes your life easier later because you don't have to worry about that too so this now becomes C2 it's still a constant who cares about that you guys okay with this one so far okay now at this point this is where you plug in your initial value notice there's no freaking way in the world that you were going to get y by itself here do you see that no there's not all LNS you can't get y y explicitly so this is where we use that initial value we say y of 0 = 1 now tell me what would our X become here One X what would our X become what would our y become so if that's the case we get 1^ 2 - Ln of 1 = -2 e to 0 + C2 Plus C2 she feel okay with with that so far this is the easy part this is really nice how much is 1 s how much is Ln 1 equals how much is e to Z 1 * -2 plus C2 and can I solve for C2 see the idea is right now what we have here look at the board this is a general solution if we called that c we'd have a general solution to this differential equation with an initial value problem it says okay Now find out how much the C is actually equal to I don't care whether it's C1 or C2 or C3 po we're going to go ahead and plug that was funny we're going to plug that in we're going to find out what so we're going to have C2 I should I should have made a C3 that would been good do you understand that I don't care what C it is whether I call this uh 2 C1 it does doesn't really matter um we're going to get the same exact thing here C2 whatever you define that as is going to be three what that means that our specific solution our particular solution to our given differential equation with our initial value is now that that's the idea so we solve our differential equation just like normal all the way down to where we have an arbitrary constant just like just like always then we plug in our initial value and we just use it Sol for your c as soon as you get your C check it out as soon as you get your C sub 2 or C sub whatever you have that's what we put in that place and now we have no arbitrary concept we have our general I'm sorry we have our particular solution so feel okay about that one hey okay all right so let's continue uh the last thing we're going to talk about in section 8.1 is natural growth and Decay and how this differential equation idea at least by separation of variables works for us so natural growth or decay what we mean by that is either growth or Decay at a rate that's proportional to the size of a given population so for instance uh you can maybe think about this in terms of growing populations for bacteria or people or other species or a decline of population uh or like a half-life of sub you guys know what halflife is yeah halflife is of Sub sub substance that's a natural growth or Decay model so we're going to study natural growth or Decay again what it means it's a growth or Decay at a rate that's proportional to the size of a population and we're going to study all about this today now when we talk about directly proportional this is actually kind of an algebra idea if we have something that is proportional really what we have is y = k * some variable so if y stands for our population size and T is time then our K is going to be some sort of a A variation model it's either going to grow this population or decline this population based on what we have for this does that make sense to you so this is our this is what directly proportional actually means so y = k * t means directly proportional well well if we were to take a derivative of this here's what would happen if we take a derivative and find out the rate of our growth or Decay so think about this if this is our population if this is our population model you guys with me on this this is our population model if we take a derivative a derivative gives us a rate of change does that make sense you should learn that from Rec calculus one class since a derivative is a rate of change a derivative of a population would be how that population is growing the change in our population so if we take a derivative we'd have Dy DT it would be respect to time equals K time Y where Y is a function of time so this would be a derivative of sorry this would be a derivative with of um population with respect to time so we say all right cool um here here's our population with respect to time if we take a derivative of this we get the rate at which our population is changing with respect to time whether it's growing growth or whether it's decaying loss does that make sense to you so we take a dri go cool what we're going to get out of this is we're going to get some sort of a con a constant variation times Y where Y is a function of t a population changes over time so this would be the rate at which our population is changing now what if K is positive what's going to happen oh is our population going to grow or Decay so for K is greater than zero what this is going to be for us is going to be a population growth well naturally if K is less than zero we're going to get decay now I want to take a look at the model of this what we're going to do right here is we're going to solve a differential equation once and for all for natural growth or Decay would you like to do that rather than every single time we're going to have a model for this okay so we're going to solve this model and then I'm going to show you how to apply this to a variety of situations so first things first so let's say that we have this very basic differential equation that we started with right here K * y well that's this what we know is that a derivative of y with respect to time right now this is going to be the rate at which our our population is changing either growing or decreasing decaying does that make sense to you guys so we're going to start with this differential equation notice it is a differential equation A first order differential equation and well let's look at that is it separable yes yeah we can get y's on one side no problem we could keep the K on one side and get the Y on the other side that would be not a problem at all so it is separable also what we're going to do is we're going to have some initial value here's what this is going to mean for us in terms of our population please listen carefully I want to make sure that you guys all get this because otherwise the next thing we're going like well why are we doing this what's what's this even for population is directly proportional to the size that some sort sorry is directly proportional and it's based on time this is the rate of change of our population okay cool we got that we get the rate of a change of population our population has to start somewhere doesn't it so if this is population based on time at Time Zero we're going to have some sort of a starting population here so when we're not going to have negative time does negative time make sense to us makes sense okay unless we go backwards in Time time travel I don't know we're not in physics class so we're not going talk about that here okay so uh what we have unfortunately for some of you I know you're sad right now uh for us right now we're going to have a starting time of zero sure at the starting time of zero we are going to have some initial population this is what this stands for so this right here for us is going to be our starting population please keep that in mind when we're going through here that y Sub 0 is the starting population when Tal so when T equals z that's means when you start it means no time has passed hey when no time has passed you were going to start with some amount of population right if you don't otherwise your population can't grow you have to start with something or or it has to Decay from somewhere so this right here stands for a starting population I was going to say one more thing but I completely forgot about that so initial value starting population let's go ahead and let's see if we can solve this thing like we normally would so remember how we solve any difference of equation the first thing that we do is we find our general solution you guys remember that with one arbitrary constant we did that last time and then what we do is we use our initial value to find a particular solution to this make sense so what right now we're going to take this off this side we're going to work just with this thing so Dy DT = KY at this point you guys should be pretty good at doing this sort of thing why don't you tell me what I'm going to do here move the Y very good why you your y on one side yeah very good take so instead of having KY here I want just the K on one side I want just the Y on the other side so we'd have one of Y Dy DT equals k so far so good hey it's separable let's separate the variables no big deal um K is going to be well it's going to turn out that K is going to be uh something based on timee as well so we're going to we're going to integrate this with respect to time as well so well now we did this last time we said okay well as soon as you have your variable separated we take an integral with respect to whatever this thing is so with respect to time here so in our case we'll have all right cool integral of 1 y dydt DT equals integral of K DT okay this should be pretty straightforward but I want to make sure your brains are with it today uh show fans feel okay with this so far so we go cool uh can we separate variables of course we can let's do it can we integrate of course we can let's do it to both sides with respect to the same exact variable on this side DTS are gone we got integral of 1 y d y tell me everybody what's the integral of 1 over y d you guys are on today I like it it's Wednesday it's wedes this only good day I get out of you awesome okay how about uh how about the integral of K DT uh you need to know that whenever we have listen please whenever we have a variable here that is not this variable this is treated like a constant I don't care what it is now K is a constant variation so this is cool for us what's that going to be k Okay cool so just like if we had three we'd pull the three up front we'd have 3T uh if we had K we can pull that k out front we have KT a Conant it is a constant yeah no notice what's happening U some of you guys were talking while I was saying this but what you wouldn't do you wouldn't do k^2 over two why not well is that a t no no this is not the variable that we are integrating with respect two it's treated as a constant is that clear for you so we don't do k^ two that doesn't make sense we're integ this is this is why ladies and gentlemen your calc this one teacher made sure that this is here they go Ah that's not such a big deal don't worry about having the D whatever it doesn't make it doesn't matter because then that would be like well what are you what are you doing is K a variable is K not a variable does it matter it matters K is not a variable K right right here is treated as a constant so we're not going to get K2 we're going to get k t as if this was a constant because we treat like a constant here you could pull this out in front it' be basically the integral of DT integral of 1 DT is multip by the K you get KT should feel okay with that idea okay come on come on ah plus c yep Plus's see1 okay now every time before when we had this this was all like LNS right if it's not all LNS on this side but it is Ln over here we can still do basically the same idea to get rid of this Ln we can take both of these sides as an exponent upon e so I I I definitely want to get rid of the Ln do you guys agree with that I want to get y by itself so that's our plan here if we want to get y by itself then we go okay well cool let's take and make each side an exponent of each we've done this before this is not a big deal so we have Ln of absolute value y as an exponent we have KT please notice something here real quick this is very important you see this this whole thing is now the exponent when you do this idea the whole side becomes your exponent above your e like that quick heading on if you're okay with with that one are you sure see okay now we're going to start working with with this e Ln absolute value what happens there that's that's great this is very nice so this is what yeah that's right absolute value y but not a problem made a mistake we're going to deal with that in a minute it doesn't really matter okay uh because we get to deal with that remember that plus or minus that's where we get to deal with it so on the right hand side we're going to start man this a little bit please remember our end goal the end goal is cool you got separation of variables do it do your integral have your plus probably a C1 cuz we know this is not going to be our ending arbitrary constant you with me call C1 or something get rid of any Ln around your y not a big deal e and then make each side an exponent upon e you got it over here cool we still have absolute value y over here well this is funky and so what I'm going to try to do is get rid of this plus C1 I'm going to try to change this into the arbitrary concept that I want want and make it as nice as possible so for us I'm going to leave this e to the KT but I'm going to multiply by e to the C1 I'm going to do that notice that if I have common bases I can add exponents therefore if I have a base with added exponents I can separate into multiplication of common bases you okay with that one well that's kind of nice now at this point let's do a little uh little razzled Dazzle this is a constant true yeah is this a constant yes let's call this a constant then so we're going to make a little side note e to the C1 is now going to be equal to C 2 our second form of our constant does that make sense so here's our first one we go no no no let's split this off because if I can split this off this is nice to get rid of this thing right so hey that's still a constant this is e to the C no problem that's still a constant let's call it just a different constant well now we have absolute value of y equals I'm going to move this to the front this will be C sub 2 time e to the K as a k e to the KT okay so P feel okay with this so far we've done it before I just want to make sure that you guys are with it now there's one more problem that we have here to face what is it that's right we need to get rid of that thing and we've learned before that if we have the absolute value equal to some sort of an expression over here that what we can do to drop our absolute value is just consider that absolute value would take a positive expression or a negative expression and make it true so for us we have positive or negative C sub 2 e to the KT and there was one more little caveat that we could do here the idea was hey this is that's that's a constant right that means this thing is a constant color different constant now this thing is a positive or C sub 2 still a constant this becomes our arbitrary constant so now we're going to let c equal plus plus or plus or minus C sub and we get y = c e to KT okay I want to show if answer you loated with that so far so let's go through maybe a 20 second recap real quick to make sure that we are all with it first thing we got is this we know this means directly proportional we means we know that this means the rate of change of whatever we're talking about in this case is population so okay we have the rate of change of our population we know that that's a differential equation which we can solve we just solve that differential equation it's right here we just solved it this would be called my general solution to this differential equation if this was not here I would be completely done does that make sense to you now we also know that initial values are going to give us a particular solution so differential equation no problem without this we're done we got a general solution this is a this is basically a family of Curves you with me now to get a specific curve to get a particular value we need an initial value that's what this thing is so General solution very good has one arbitrary constant that's an arbitrary constant that's c k is going to be based on whatever your population model is okay so that's not arbitrary C is your arbitrary constant now to get our particular solution we're going to now use our starting population or our initial value in this case so let's use it initial value if you didn't catch it our initial value is our starting population it says hey how much is your population at time equals zero or so basically when you start your experiment or when you start start your research or whatever you're talking about so it says what's going to go in place of our now we don't have X's here okay we have the variable of what T's are variable and Y so what's going to go in place of our t z good what's going to go in place of our y y sub Z that's CU I ask why not why yeah so what we do here is we go okay well this says remember that Y is a function of T we set it right here Y is a function of T so when I have y of Zer it means that well C is still there e still there K is still there but T becomes zero now it says y when I plug in zero is going to give me y Sub 0 well this this Y is then y Sub 0 quick sh answer be okay with that so far now this is going to be kind of interesting and hopefully it makes sense that we're going to get not an actual number for for C because we don't have an actual number here does that make sense to you I'll explain this in just a bit so it makes absolute perfect concrete s for sense for you what's going to happen to our e to the K * 0 how much is that going to be so this is z e to0 is one there for what we get is y Sub 0 = c y Sub 0al C does that make sense let's go one step further we're to finish this thing off so for the last time overly General differential equation not a problem if I have an initial value I can get a particular solution our particular solution therefore is y equals uh what did our C change to all the way down what's our C let's talk about what this actually means let's talk about what this means did you all understand that y Sub 0 equals sorry uh y of 0al Y Sub 0 is your starting population please listen up here for a second let's say that your starting population was I don't know 200 200 whatever 200 units people uh whatever word be talking about so at time Z you'd have 200 does that make sense yeah over here you wouldn't have y of0 equals y Sub 0 you'd have y 0al 200 your C would equal 200 here does that make sense this would be 200 y Sub 0 stands for your starting population so what's nice about doing it this way what's nice about solving this once and for all is that now we have a model for growth or Decay based on your starting population please keep in mind that y sub Z is your starting population what is that p e t it's really similar and that's very very interesting um because we get that growth of Interest uh the amount of interest that you earn what is it it's amount isn't it equals the principal e to the rate time time very interesting uh that we get get it from here but yep that's where it comes from so what this is is this is a solution for growth or Decay where y sub Z is our starting population what that means is that anytime you want to find out how your population's growing or decaying you can use this model right now we did it right we said hey if it's directly proportional to the size the rate of change equals this not a problem we solved our differential equation generally we said now let's consider that at Time Zero we have a starting population if we use the time Z equals a starting population then C actually equals that starting this is all I'm trying to say is that our constant our arbitrary constant is actually equal to the starting population that's what I'm trying to say here what that means is that this guy right here is basically a Sol solution for growth or Decay where y sub Z is a star population um talk about a couple other things I mentioned it over here but I want to give you a picture of it let's say that K is positive if K is positive understand a couple things about this y sub Z is a constant do you understand that it's going to be a number here so it's going to be whatever you're starting with it's not a variable it's going to be like uh in this classroom we start with that's a weird talk about growth I don't want to talk about Decay either I want do all the die or anything let's say that we have a a culture of bacteria okay it's going to start somewhere at a finite number that's going to go here so notice that's a constant but this is e to some variable it's an exponential based on E well if that's the case t t is always going to be what positive or negative for sure we're not going to go backwards in time so K is the only thing that's going to to determine how this graph looks if K is positive if K is positive it's got to grow because it is an e a function of e to some power do you remember how e looks it's the remember that so it's going to do this now of course for us if this is based on time what part of this graph is not valid this doesn't matter because we can't have negative time we're starting at zero so this is what it says that hopefully this makes sense to you it says you're going to start somewhere hey look at that you're G to start at zero you'd start at this starting point why that makes perfect sense that's our population size right there it says that if K is positive you will be growing at some rate exponentially yes that's how growth works if you think about it you start with two bunnies lot of bunnies Okay give it a year produces as much meat as a cow okay if you have two bunnies you just let them go do whatever bunnies do now if K is negative we get that other graph this one again for the same reason because this is a function of T and T cannot be negative that side doesn't matter well this would be what growth or Decay actually you're going to start somewhere hey look at that if you plug in zero you're still going to get y Sub Zero your popul start Somewhere Only now it's declining does that make sense to you yeah sure P feel okay with this idea cool would you like some examples of how to actually do this question the proof right this is this is yeah uh this is a proof that we can do natural growth or Decay with this model that's basically what that's saying um I'm basically saying hey you know what if I get to tell you that our population is growing or declining uh or find out what your population is is doing you can use this with your starting population now we're going to talk about some very simple examples and build on this right now any you guys a good question any other questions at all did this side make sense to you I got to erase this before I get keep going okay one thing that does have to be present is you do have to have this idea of proportional growth if the problem doesn't state that then you can't really assume it so this is all based on the idea that the population is growing or decaying at the prop in proportionality to the starting population or to the population does that make sense some things grow or Decay outside of proportion to the population um for instance I'm not sure if this is exactly true but I would think it would be true if you have a series of bacteria and you drop some acid onto it uh it's probably going to die very very quickly not proportional to itze size that's going to be outside cause it's cause it done does that make sense or an antibiotic or something so that would be nonproportional to the size it's going to kill it all in a matter of seconds whether it's five bacteria or a billion bacteria you just dump it on there and it's gone does that make sense so what we have to State on here for us to do this your problem has to be worded something like this growth of bacteria is proportional to the population it's got to say something about the proportionality of growth or Decay okie dokie growth of bacteria is proportional to uh its back to its population and the reason why it has to be is because this this right here this comes from the idea of that directly proportional uh model so we have to have that somewhere worded where it's proportional initially 600 bacteria are present after three hours 10,000 bacteria are present you ever done any work in algebra uh with direct variation or inverse variation you know that you you basically have to be given two two things you got to be given a formula which we have you got to be given a scenario like after this amount of time this is happening so in order for us to find K this would have to be the case so you'd say okay what's the starting size let's give some time and say oh now it's here now we have some sort of a model to base this growth on does that make sense to you so here's what we're going to do uh what I want to do is find the amount of bacteria after T hours find number of bacteria after T hours you see if we can do this if we can find after T hours then we can plug in however many hours we want and we'll be able to find a good model for our bacteria so far so good yeah basically what you said is right we're going to be finding K here we got to find that con that variation that constant variation for this particular model so uh man what are we going to do well uh do we have AEL model for growth or Decay that's based on proportional proportionality to a population Yeah we actually did it don't redo all this stuff okay I did this for reason so that we understand that this is that's okay so we have uh all right well this is very convenient for us uh we know that y = y Sub 0 e to the K T we know that's true we also know something right off the bat right off the bat we know one of these pieces what's what one of these pieces do we know initial and final we know initial so initial says Hey y sub Z is how much that's right that's always this is what I was trying to get at you here is that your your arbitrary constant is here CU we we showed it proved it y sub Z is your initial population which makes it really nice W the bat you go okay how much did you start with you started with 600 your initial value is at Time Zero it is the 600 units of bacteria okay show feel okay with with that one it's kind of simple but I want to make sure that you actually get it next up do we know what do you mean what's our time 3 hours and what do we have after 3 hours 10,000 10,000 what bacteria and that's a population so if Y is our population variable then y when I plug in 3 hours is equal to how much do you notice how I'm creating another type of it's not an initial value but it's another uh it's a basically an order pair it says when you have t of three you get y = 10,000 this is what this second sentence basically tells us so okay with with that one let's plug the numbers in so we had our initial 600 units of bacteria at time equals zero well that's that's not bad um that was pretty easy to actually do you think about it you could plug in uh zero and 600 and you solve for y not every single time couldn't you even if you didn't have this you could do that you say what's a when T equals z this is gone correct and Y would equal 600 hey y Sub 0 equal 600 duh that's a PC we just did it once and for all that's why it was so easy over here now when y equals sorry when = 3 after 3 hours after 3 hours we have 10,000 units of bacteria so what goes where 10,000 10,000 goes here no 10,000 goes here yes 600 is not going to change e to the K3 K * sure K * 3 so why was 10,000 no problem this is how this this this works here of order pair Works says this goes for your y this goes for your other independent variable of T your K is what we're looking for how am I going to do that divide by 600 I would do that I would divide by 600 so if I divide by what am I going to get if I divide by 600 100 6 say what now say 100 100 let's try to simplify 50 over 3 maybe 16 so 50 3 = e to the K * 3 so feel okay with that one now tell you what we're going to be smart about this hopefully we're be smart about this I'm not not going to do an Ln on both sides I'm not going to do that I know there's an e right there but I'm going to be smart about this here's what I'm going to do what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually make this so instead of getting K itself all I really need is to substitute for a part of this right just a part of it I just need not just the K but maybe if we can get rid of the whole e to the K that would be kind of nice wouldn't that be kind of nice so I'm not going to solve for K I'm going to solve for e to the K what that means means is that if I have e to the K * 3 what if I take that to a 1/3 power I do that on both sides is this 1/3 going to get rid of this three we have exponents raised to exponents we multiply yes yes this is gone so what this says is 50 over 3^ 1/3 power is equal to e to the K now that is a good substitution this is what we can put in right here now that's a problem I'm not going to do parentheses that would be mathematical error uh but this is what we're going to be doing here show p is okay with with that one so we have a solve for K we've solved for e to the k no problem just let that be our substitution does that make sense to you okay so let's do it U I'm going to change this around just a little bit so that we we see what's going on this would be y = 600 e to K * t or if you thought about it differently this would be y = 600 E to the K to the T power you guys okay with that one am I going too fast for you or are we okay it's just some algebra but I know the algebra can be intimidating for some of us okay well then y = 600 um do we have an expression that's equal to e the K how much is it let's be real careful about this that's all being raised to the T you guys with me on that one so we said all right cool um we we have this this piece K we have this this will let us solve for our K if we want it to we're smarter than you know okay I could I could solve for my K right now if I want with an Ln no big deal uh or I could think about well let's make things a little bit nicer let's just solve for e to the K and use that substitution so are you okay solving for e to the K here with that 1/3 power well now we go all right well let's think about this this is really 600 E K all to the T since e k = 50 3 1/3 power e k = 50 over 3 1/3 power but this is raised to the T therefore this is raised to the T power you follow one last thing we're going to do this is nasty exponent raised to that's nasty even the r it's written you're going to make that better I find my handwriting is getting worse and worse as I get older and that's not cool my written like on my Note it's perfect but on the board I keep going faster and faster gets sloppier and sloppy so I got to stop that make a mental note to stop that expon raise to an exponent what do you do let's let's put that together let's have y = 600 50 over3 to the what power t t over3 that's perfect 1/3 t or t over3 that's fantastic now here's my question is this going to be the growth model for everything in the world no this is only for this specific type of bacteria and we got that because we had an initial population we had to have that and we had to have how it's actually growing how it's growing lets us make this model for it so far so good but now that we have this I can ask you any question that I want to uh for in can I ask you how much bacteria will be present after 5 hours yes sure let's figure that out how much bacteria will be present after 5 hours how much bacteria present after five hours where would the five go here there's only two two places to plug numbers in in it uh the T stands for your time what's the Y stand foration that's very good your population no matter what s for your population so population size and your time so if I want after 5 hours our population would equal a starting population of 600 * 50 over 3 to the 5 5/3 so we do 50 divid 3 take to the 5/3 power then multiply by 600 by order operations make sure you do it in that order and Y would equal what so fast 65247 same same yeah I have no idea wait what you say it was 65 2478 this is called 6.5 * 10 65248 about I'm in degrees about 64 65248 65248 what BAC little bitty bacteria that's right now I'm no scientist I'm really not I'm not very good at science actually I was a decent science uh but let's just pretend for a second that it takes uh 20,000 bacteria to make you sick or so you present symptoms so you get this little infection of 600 bacteria and after five hours you get 65,000 bacteria are you going to start feeling symptoms if the symptoms start uh yeah at 40 yeah okay I don't know if that's the way it works but I'm going to pretend it does in my little mind that makes sense to me uh but anyway no matter what we can find out a growth model for this particular bacteria does that make sense until the food runs out once food runs out well then naturally it's going to start decaying okay last question could you find out how long it would take to grow bacteria to a certain size yeah let's find that one out so what do I want when will the bacteria when will the the the uh bacteria reach a population size of 24,000 maybe this is the better question it says okay tell you what we know with this strain of bacteria that you start feeling symptomatic at when the bacteria is over 24,000 units or whatever uh we started 600 units so right now we need to figure out well when's it going to reach that how long does it take for you to start feeling or whatever whatever we're talking about how long does it take for it to reach that population no matter what we're talking about where would the 24,000 go why so we'd say from our model here this is what we can use in either situation only ask two questions how much is it going to be after a certain time or when's this time it's going to be a certain amount so 24,000 equals 600 I give you nice numbers 50 over 3 to the T over three my goodness how in the world would you solve that yeah I divide by 600 to start with so we'd get how much 40 40 40 yeah 40 well there's really no way around it here what are we going to do natural now it's natural log of both sides because we got to get to this exponent so natural log of 40 equals natural log of bunch of crap why we do this I'm not going to teach you to algebra again why we do this is so that we can bring the exponent down if we do that Ln of 40 equal T over3 Ln 503 after that can you solve for your T this would be multiplying by 3 and dividing by Ln of 50 over 3 so 3 Ln 40 ided Ln of 50 over 3 equals T now I've done the work for you already so if you want to practice with your calcor go ahead and do that right now um but for us we're going to get is approximately 3.93 hours Let's see if that jives with our initial Val conditions over here okay um if it says 600 present after 3 hours we get 10,000 does it make sense that after 3.9 hours we get more than that yeah it's exponential growth so it's going to go grow faster than linear so it's it is it is growing like this okay the more bacteria you have the faster it's growing that should make sense bacteria double pretty quickly okay so you get more bacteria it's going to grow faster in proportion to its size you feel all right with that one tell you what we'll start one more now that we have this idea kind of down uh this is it goes so nice and quick for us um let's talk about something a little different than growth let's talk about Decay are there any questions on this at all did I explain it well enough for you to understand it that one question question cuz when we were solving for K you solved for EK instead so that's fine yeah Sol for EK yeah I would definitely solve for e to the K because we're just taking that little bit and substituting in there okay you could actually solve for K but then when you when you realize it it's going to be e to the Ln isn't it yeah e to the Ln is gone so we're going to be smart about this and not have to do that here there's no way around it you got to solve for T itself because we're want to find out the number of years okay have we have we uh explain this well enough for you okay one thing I think I introduced the section with this one thing that decay in proportion to its population are certain substances so let's assume that the half life of the substance is proportional to its sorry that the way that this decays is proportional to its size so suppose that the halflife of some substance of compound a is 1,62 years let's suppose that we have 100 mgram to start almost sounds like science doesn't it I'm like this chemistry all over again well is this organic chemistry or something no just regular chemistry for B 4 B I don't even know what that means let's find the amount you're going to notice that what we do for Decay what we do here is very akin to what we did for growth we're going to follow the same exact model we're going to find amount after T years well that should be pretty easy to do uh let's start find the amount after T years um do we know that this is growth or Decay yeah it's Decay uh well the model is going to be exactly the same so we're going to have y = y Sub 0 e to K * T now there's a couple things that we need to know about this couple things that we need to know about this firstly do we know how much y of Z is 100 m remember y of zero says how much do you start with do you know how much you started with you guys okay with that one you start with 100 hey y of Z or Y sub Z is going to be 100 we know that one but there's also something else you just need to know how to write it when it says a half life when it says a half life it gives us a piece of information here so it says after how many years 1602 after 16002 years we're going to have half but listen carefully we're going to have half of whatever we started with does that make sense so we're going to use our starting amount to come up with this thing if we start with 100 mg at year zero I say let's give it 16002 years we're going to have that's what half life means means you have half of it left how much is going to be left if you get this you're going to get the rest of this show hands if you get that one tell you what why don't you try this one I'm going to go through this quickly next time very quickly next time why don't you try this at home or if you're if you're watching this try this on your own find out a couple things firstly I want you to find out how much is after for two years so come go up and do this basically you can get down to this this far okay after that find out how much you'd have after 1,000 years and how long it would take to get 40 Mig so basically it I mean you can do you see the similarity here it's exactly the same I'm not asking you to go out and solve how to get to the moon or something I it's already been done a long time ago uh unless you're conspiracy theorist and they never made it whatever so after a amount of years hey after a certain amount of years this going to be very similar to this just plug the number in how much will we get to how long will it take to 40 Mig so after a thousand years how much we going to have and how long will will take to get to 40 milligrams can you guys do that for me let's do that we thousand years how long will take you 40 milligrams okay let's go uh so we have this problem we're working on as I've asked you to go do this on your own uh most of you didn't actually do that probably people on tape didn't do that either so we're going to do it together but very fast so the half life of Subs substance is 16002 years if you have 100 Mig to start with a couple questions firstly find the amount after T years now what we're going to assume is that this fits our model of y equal y0 e to KT if you'll remember from last time we got this from solving a Bas basically just solving a differential equation uh that was it this was a proportional a proportional problem that we said okay if we find a derivative that's a rate at which this is changing therefore we solve a differential equation and we have one situation that let us go from an arbitrary constant into this y sub Z it was that we are always going to start with some initial amount when we're checking population growth or Decay here our population is kind of like this 100 milligrams of some substance that we have so with our halflife the first idea is well you got to see what our y Sub 0 is and then we're going to have to see something that lets us solve for our k so firstly tell me what the Y sub Z stands for initial initial population sure initial population or initial amount that we have what is our initial amount that we have okay so what we know that right now is that y sub Z because we are in terms of t t stands for in this case it stands for years it can be any amount of time minutes hours whatever seconds sometimes for certain Half Lives um but here we have well y Sub 0 equal 100 well yes it is 100 y sub Z stands for the amount that we're going to have after zero years have passed so basically right when we started we have 100 milligram of some substance now what's interesting this is I think where I probably left you last time I'm not really sure we also have another statement given up here if we know that the half life is a certain number of years then what we know is that after that amount of years specifically here after 16002 years we're going to have half of whatever we started with what that does that gives us another ordered pair it says after this amount of time you should be able to tell me how much we have left how much are we gonna have left 50 how'd you get 50 half of yeah it's half of 100 if the half life is 1600 years then after 16002 years we're going to have half of our initial amount or half of the 100 that's the 50 should F be okay with that so far well now we start breaking it down okay so if y of Zer is 100 that means that our starting amount is simply 100 therefore instead of yal Y sub Z we go no no no our starting amount is 100 mg not a problem now what are we going to do sit here quietly very good that's exactly right what are we going to do change which is 100 1 what's the idea in plugging those numbers in what are we trying to find right now we can for K but yeah we can solve for K but a nice thing about this is that if we solve for e to the K well then we can make a larger substitution and not have to worry about the Ln so what we're going to do is we're going to try to find a value for e to the K how we do that we use this other piece of information we have to have two pieces we got to have an initial value then we have to have how much you have left after a certain amount of time you got to have another ordered pair something that tells you something additionally so in our case we go all right no not a problem uh how much how much is the Y if I plug in this is it the 1602 or is it the 50 50 yeah it says the Y is the 50 that's how much we'll have left the 100 doesn't change the E doesn't change the K is what we're we're really missing here times what's the T in our case 16 that's right what's the next thing you do try to isolate e to the K sure how are we going to isolate e to the K come on help me if we divide by that 100 we're going to get 12 equals e to the K * 162 keep wrting 1620 1602 how about after that can we solve for e to the K in this case of course we can yeah if we consider this as 12 = e to the K to the 162 power well then basically all we got to do is raise both sides to a specific value that's going to give us uh a simplification of that exponent specifically if we take both sides to the one over 16002 power it's a weird power but if we do that on both sides then what we end up getting is that e to the K = 12 to the 1/ 16 00 second power this right here do you remember that when you have xon to raised to expon we multiply 1600 * 1 over 1600 gone we just get to you the K this side we have 12 to the 1 over 1600 second power show hands feel okay with that so far I know we went through a little fast but we've done this before so I want to make sure that we get on another concept here in just a bit oh don't want to RIS that almost it well now we can do our substitution so when we do notice that we want to change this thing but we only want to change the E the K so we'll have yal 100 how much does the e to the K become is that it where's the T go okay so really this is normally like like this correct this would be oh look at this 100 e to the k no no no not e to the K we're going to have 12 the 1 over 16002 power to the T or times the T so we could have to the T power but to make it a little nicer we just have to multiply this power time T to make it a little nicer than that well instead of having one over 1,62 * T let's just put the T on the numerator that make it a little bit nicer so we have that I want to show hands you feel okay with that that one so far now this is basically all we have to do to satisfy this question find the amount after T years we've done it y stands for the amount of the substance we have left when it's based on however many years were given does that make sense this half is not coincidental if you're talking about halflife well think about that if you're talking about halflife whatever you have here is should be exactly half of whatever you have here correct and your very first step's going to be to divide you're always going to get 1 half right there it's basically just based on whatever the number of years is what where you start with whatever the number of years is show pant should be okay with with that idea now let's solve our questions if I want to find the amount after 1,000 years use our model where's the 1,000 go andt so we're going to have y equals 100 doesn't change 1/2 doesn't change we're going to have 1,00 over 16 002 and someone who's really quick with a calculator 64 64 what8 88 sure 64.8 that sounds about right let's see if that sounds about right uh what we know is this we know that half of this material should be gone after 16002 years correct yes so if I give you 1,000 years less than 1602 we should have less than half of it go is it does that work out for us we start with 100 if we if we do this and we get something like 300 your product has miraculously grown that probably won't make sense okay this is supposed to decompose over time so this is less than Halfway Gone we've had less than half the halflife so sounds about right how long will it take to get 40 milligrams what would we do in that case y yeah in this case we say all right we'll use our model here if y stands for the amount of the substance left then we're going to have 40 milligram equals well the same model 100 12 to the T over 16002 how would you solve this what would you do divide by 100 you divide by 100 so if we divide by 100 we get 410 we get two fths now at this point yeah we should probably take the natural log if we do that what's what we're going to be allowed to do is take the exponent and we're going to move that forward so natural log of 2s equal natural log of 12 to the T over 16002 after that well we should know this the reason why we do a natural log with exponentials is this allows us to Mo our exponents to the front as a coefficient so we have Ln of 2s = t/ 16002 * Ln 12 then we just do some multiplication and division if we want to solve for T we're going to multiply by 1602 we're going to divide by Ln of 12 so we get 16002 time Ln of 25ths over Ln of 12 = t as it figured that one out 2,118 years 2 let me see if that's what I got too yeah that's exactly what I got 2,18 years let's see if that fits our model half of it should be gone in600 years correct we're asking when's more than half of it going to be gone well it should be more than 1600 years we got that it's not like hugely more like a million years or something but uh few hundred years later exactly right show hands feel okay with this idea pretty straightforward actually most I mean we didn't even do calculus today did we it's basically just pluging numbers in and solving for them that's really just the idea um any questions or comments before we get on to our last one you sure okay last one this is an interesting one I like this question this idea because I've always wanted about it when I was a kid uh why why why this works the way that it works what I'm talking about is the law of cooling by the way any questions the law of what late now the law of cooling cool cooling the law of cooling are we going to apply calculus any of this this is calculus we've already done it yeah I just more no um no not really uh I just want to show you a few applications of what this can be used for um I think I've basically covered how to do differential equations by separation variables right it's a very straightforward idea we're not going to sit there and do tons of examples of that I wanted to give you something more concrete uh so I'm trying to give you some I find these interesting I really do that that this is applicable yeah we're not doing a whole lot of integrals right here but we've already done the basic integral to solve for population growth or Decay so we're just using that right now uh one way that we can use that is with this law of cooling um now what happens what happens if your house is 50° versus when your house is 90° you take something out of the oven in which case is that thing in the oven going to retain its temperature longer obviously because the the surrounding ambient temperature is warmer right well there's there's actually a law for that that's called The Law of cooling now I didn't understand that when I was a kid and I didn't understand why sometimes when you take cookies out of the oven and it's 85 they burn burn your mouth for like 30 minutes versus in the winter time you can eat him in 5 minutes I didn't get that so I always when I saw like oh yeah that might that makes perfect sense now cuz I'm an idiot when I'm a little kid bur my mouth all the time cuz I was fat kid and I couldn't wait for them to get out of I get them all anyway so mookies I still am a kind of a fat kid I I still love eating cookies who doesn't love eating cookies idiots idiots don't love eating cookies I don't know maybe some people like cookies crazy people here's what you need to know about the law of cooling a body cool and I don't mean like a dead body because that's really gross I mean a body like a an item object object sure body a body cool well you know in physics they use body body at rest tend to stay at rest body motion tends to stay at motion a body cools proportionally to the difference between the body and the ambient temperature a body cools proportionally to the difference that's interesting between the body and the ambient temperature um just I don't I know that you guys are smart but you guys know what ambient means not an ambient okay nothing with drugs uh but an ambient do you know what ambient means yes okay if you don't know what that means it means the surrounding atmosphere of of the body in this case so right now the ambient Ambient temperature would be the temperature of this room that you're in I'd say 71° I would estimate but that's the ambient temperature I'm very comfortable are you guys comfortable yeah yeah ambient temperature is nice then we're going to do this with an example so here's my example I'm such a dork that on Thanksgiving I literally did this I literally did the math on this thing to find out uh how this would actually work cuz I'm I'm so work um although I I kind of overcooked my turkey so it was really dry because I cooked it to 225 degrees internal temperature and you don't have to do that it's like 165 or something like that that's what gravy is for that's what gravy is for that's right I don't like turkey I I ate the ham so let those other fools eat the turkey they had some burned old turkey so a turkey is taken out of an oven at 225° maybe the outside would be hotter than that even it's taken out of an oven at 200 25° after 20 minutes I checked it after 20 minutes it was 185° that was a well done ter now you need to know that at my house it stays a nice 70° all the time is that important to know yes yes because if I was really cheap during Thanksgiving and said I'm not run the heater at all it'd be like 50° in which case the turkey would cool off faster much more convenient for eating but you have to eat in a jacket so that's not super fun if I kept it at 90° my electricity be able be through the roof but the turkey would not cool off for a long time so it'd be very comfortable in shorts but not be able to eat for a few hours so anyway uh my temperature in the house or the the ambient temperature the temperature of the house was 70° at the time here's what we want to do I want to find the temperature at any time then I'm going to ask you a series of questions how much is the temperature after 30 minutes uh when can I cut the turkey and not burn my fingers so we'll ask a couple of those things so um firstly we need to understand that y of t let Define our variables right here y of T is going to be what what does the y stand for in our case here the y y the Y is going to be my temperature that's right so y of t y of T says this give me the temperature I know we're not using a t for temperature but y stands for temperature here give me the temperature after a given amount of time so this would be the um temperature let's also Define what T is over here T was in years uh is my time in years here it's going to take me 30 years to eat my turkey no that's silly okay it's going to be it's in minutes so time in minutes time and minutes now there's a few things that we need to identify before we start our problem the first one is this first one we got to figure out what our initial values are for the situation so can you tell me now that we have this can you tell me how much y of Z is in fact can you tell me what y of0 actually means in reference to this problem it's kind of good to know right I don't want you just to do these things by rot memorization of how to do differen equations in these cooling problems but understand what the what it means what does y of Z actually mean when you first took it out of the oven good so this going to be the temperature when I first took it out not when I start cooking it but right when I open the oven door because it's going to start cooling at that moment when I take it right out of the oven so at y of z mean or sorry y of zero means the temperature right when I remove it how much is that to 25 perfect do we know anything else about this problem right now after 20 after how many 20 how am I going to write that y 20 185 good so it says Hey the temperature after 20 minutes was 185 that's a two pieces of information I know we always need those two pieces of information where we're starting and how it's How that uh temperature is declining or or how the population is growing we need another piece of information to be able to solve for our e to the K or our K or whatever we're talking about in each case so far so good now the last thing we need to know is what the differential equation looks like well it's important that we actually set this up correctly you see we're not going to have exactly the same model every time we got to think about what's going on if we know that a body cools proportionally that's cool that's going to be no pun intended but that's going to be K times something for sure now if it says the body cools proportionally to the difference between well that's going to be that's be something else it's be a little different here so here's what we know that right there would be please pay attention I'm going to change this you don't need to write this down right now just sit here and watch this would be a rate of change that is proportional to something this would be proportionality we've talked about this before does that make sense if I want the rate of change being proportional to just what the temperature is I'm good that's what this says rate of change is proportional to the temperature got it temperature right here is my amount do you understand that it's it's not like a the size of the turkey that's not what I'm talking about it's the temperature itself the hotter it is the faster it's going to cool in a given situation as it gets closer and closer to the to the temperature of the room it's going to cool slow more slowly does that make sense to you it's it's proportional Decay but it's it's on that exponential model um so anyway this would be proportional growth or Decay now I'm not directly proportional to the temperature what I am directly proportional to says okay you're going to be proportional it's going to be K times something I'm directly proportional to what the difference between what body and the Ambi between the body difference means what subra and the ambient temperature what's the ambient temperatures that's where that comes into play so I want you to understand why this is the way that it is firstly do you understand that when I'm proportional it's going to be K * something that's what a proportional concept means so our rate of change is proportional that means our rate of change will be K times some amount it should tell you what it's what it's in reference to up here so if it was just hey the rate of decline of my temperature is proportional to the temperature it would have been KY now you have you understand that concept it's not though it says the rate of change of my temperature is proportional K times to the difference ah between the body the temperature of the body remember that y stands for the temperature of the body and the ambient temperature so this says it's proportional the difference sorry the the rate of change of my temperature is proportional K times to the difference between the temperature of the body and the ambient temperature show if be okay with these Concepts it's important to set up right otherwise we're going to be kind of kind of stuck on this thing now for the calculus we're going to go through it it doesn't fit the model so yeah we're going to have to do a little bit more calculus here um let's think about this in terms of a differential equation we already got our initial values that's cool cool can you do that differential equation first is it a differential equation oh yeah it's an equation it's got a first order difference equation situation going on here can you separate the variables yeah how would you do that divide by no I don't want to do that I want to get y's on the left hand side I want the K's on the right hand side not going to do that either y yeah let's just do that let's move this whole piece over here so if I move this whole piece over here I've got 1 over y - 70 Dy DX equal K hey are all my y variables on one side and everything else on the other side yes that's what I'm looking for that's a separation of variables thanks for emphasis yeah Drop It Like It's Hot throw B anyway uh what would I do at this point now that I have my variables on different sides what do I do come on you should know this what do we do some of you know it yeah you're just not excited about it goodness so we're going to integrate both sides with respect to X well not really in fact I have I have this uh completely wrong from the very beginning uh you should tell me the one mistake I've made actually I've made lots of mistakes but today I've made one mistake and no one caught it actually so I just kind of left it I wrote it like I'm have to catch that uh I made a mistake from almost the beginning what is it DT it's not with there's no X we don't have one so be careful with with I I messed up right here and I just left it I want to see if you caught it we we need to really be we failed you failed it should be a DT listen it's not a rate of change with respect to X you don't even know X is right here we have a rate of change with respect to temperature it's the way the temperature is changing okay with respect to time temperature with time temperature with time the way the temperature is changing with respect to time right there temperature with time time now let's continue DTS canc yeah that's right they do so DTS are gone got that we got integral of 1/ y - 70 Dy equals integral of K D DT can you tell me something about about this side do we do K two in this case no we're integrating with respect to which is why it was so important we had this correct you got to get your the the varibles correct on this it says K is treated like a constant here K is a constant it's constant variation so we're going to have K keep going oh okay how about the left hand side we have 1 y - 7 what are you going to do with that L are you starting to see how we're going to have lots of LNS right now lots of Ln here so Ln we do a little substitution we say hey der of this is only one though so our integral is going to be pretty easy we're going to get absolute value of y - 7 inside of that for the argument of our LM so P be okay with that one okay calculus was pretty easy calculus is done now our job is to do what with this find arbitrary uhhuh well we're going to have to solve for y to do so let's get rid of Ln how we get rid of Ln got so treat that as an exponent upon e on both sides Ln absolute value y - 70 = e to the whole thing KT + C sub one here Ln is gone we get absolute value y - 70 right hand side we get e to the KT I've done this before so I'm going quickly times e to the C1 so far so good we're going to call C2 e to C1 since this piece is a constant I'm going to call it a different constant therefore I get absolute value of y - 70 equal C2 e to KT last thing we're going to do again we're moving quickly because this is exactly what we've done before do you guys see how similar this is from what we've done before we're going to say y - 70 = plus or minus C sub 2 e KT and then we're going to find our arbitrary constant C to equal plus or minus C to the uh C sub 2 since this is going to be a constant I got y - 70 = c e the KT oop sorry I should have actually done that need more space that's General this is the general that's right this is the general solution to this differential equation we started right here that's the general solution show hands be okay with the general solution now how do we go from a general solution to a particular solution what do we do now we've already used well did we use any of them what have we used so far well nothing really 70 we just use a 70 the Aban can we solve for our c that would be our first case which one do we use to solve for our C initial ini probably this one would be easy to do right we'd plug in where would the zero Ro go I I want to make sure you guys are okay getting some kind of vague looks on your faces either you're tired or you're bored or you don't get it I want just the first two actually I don't want any of them so knock those off everybody um are you okay with getting this far on your own yeah pretty basic separation of variables do your integral solve it all the way down get rid of the stuff we've gone through several times now now start working on what the k is and what the E what the C is get rid of the C first find out what the that arbitrary constant is with your initial value that's why they call it an initial value where you start at zero so * 0 = 225 tell me how to write that if y of 0 = 225 then y - 70 changes to what 225 yep C e to the K times what ladies and gentlemen zero perfect is this going to allow us to solve for key for C really easily yes yes for sure how much is e to the K * Z one so this whole thing is one this right how much is 225 7 155 therefore c equal 155 done we got it now let's rewrite our equation so what we know now is that y - 70 so we have our general solution not a problem use your initial value to find a particular solution so we're changing from General to particular by solving for r c that's it so General's here plug in the initial value we got it0 for RT no problem that's why it works so nicely this whole thing goes away you get C itself 2254 r y because the initial value at Z is 225 this is a constant this reduces to our c not a problem now rewrite it we know that y - 70 equals well not C anymore 155 e k * T So essentially what we've done we've used our initial value to change a general solution into a particular solution based on this initial value that's what's making it particular because listen with differential equations we're now forcing this is weird but we're forcing this family of temperature curves to go through this particular point you see this is the temperature curve for my house this is it for anything I take out of the oven in my house it's going to cool like that because my house is 70° does that make sense now I'm saying I took out something at 225 figure out what happens now that changes it to oh how much is your temperature 225 that's now a particular temperature curve had I taken it out at 450° it'd be different a different whatever that was up there okay it'd be four whatever say 450 - 7 and that would now be your C so F feel okay with that one all right so cool what now whatever you want sulur whatever you want to S what do you mean sulur whatever you ask question time and minute I just asked what do we do now oh you want us to find a general time no we're missing something up here right now we got get rid of that e to the K so how do we get rid of the E this isn't going to let us do anything right now if I say hey find the temperature after 30 minutes you're going to go cool what would be 30 what would K be we don't know I don't know that's why you have to be given this second piece of information so there's initial value initial value solves for your C your general this is going to allow you to solve for your K does that make sense so now we plug that in so from here we go okay this is cool this is a particular solution right now but this next piece is going to make it so that we can solve for my variation so if y of 20 equals 185 let's continue to plug this in uh go for it what do we do 185 - 70 185 - 70 = 155 K * 20 perfect 20 is our time 85 is our temperature now we solve it uh let's solve for e to the K like we did before that way we don't have to be worried about those LNS 85 - 70 115 = 155 e to the K I'm going to write like this right now just to the 20th power e k * 20 is the same thing as e k to the 20th then what do we do divide 155 let's do that let's divide and let's simplify what do you get when you divide 115 by 155 and simplify how much you get 23 23 over 31 now let's get rid of that exponent how do we get rid of that exponent no I don't want to do Ln right now I don't want to do that I want to leave the e to the K because what I'm going to do is for this whole entire piece right there how do we get rid of the 20 the power of 20 okay so by multiplying exponents we're taking each listen the math on this by multiplying our exponents together we're taking each side to that power so in our case we're going to take this to the 1 over 20th power and this side to the 1 over 20th power so 23 over 31 to 1/ 20th power equals e k because these things are gone what that does for us it changed now our particular solution into something will work only with this only with this situation with our turkey okie dokie actually so the 225 kind of did that too but that would be for anything out taken out of the oven but if I took cookies out of the oven at 225 well they're probably not going to match this situation so this is just for this particular turkey does that make sense so General worked for anything in uh my house particular said anything in my house taken out of the oven at 225° this one says anything taken out of sorry the one we're about to make says anything taken out of the oven at 225° in in my house at look at in my house at 225° and now this last one says and fits this scenario where after 20 minutes it's 185° I need to make sure you guys get this are you okay translating from this guy to this guy using this mhm this was hey same thing same thing e to the K is now this piece to the 1 over 20 but since I'm multiplying by T I get T over 20 instead of 1 over 20 show up hands you right with that one so let's go through it one time real quick here that- 70 came because the difference between the temperature of the body and the temperature of my house so my this is for my house 70° this came from solving for a particular solution sorry particular uh yeah particular solution given that the item starting out the body starting out is 225° does that make sense to you this comes from this particular piece of information saying that this has to fit the scenario that after 20 minutes it's 185° if the body doesn't fit that scenario this won't work but I could maybe change that does that make sense to you okay so now we continue let's solve this for y just one little step how can I solve it for y just add so y = 70 + 155 23 over 31 to the T over 20 I get two questions first question what will the temperature of my turkey be after 30 minutes where would the 30 go pretty easy now it's just plugging numbers in so we' say the temperature would equal 70 + 155 23 31 to the well T stands for this is why we defined it okay T was time in minutes we had on the board earlier T was time in minutes if I want 30 minutes i' put 30 over 20 y equals y stands for our temperature that's we said Y in terms of T was our temperature we already defined that how much is that did you figured out 169 yeah about 169° that's still a really hot turkey let's see if it fits listen um after 20 minutes it was 185 it's cooling right after 30 minutes it should be cooler was it yeah hey that works now let's find out this how long does Mr Leonard have to wait to cut his turkey so he won't burn his fingers what's the how long does Mr Leonard have have to wait to cut the turkey darn turkey burnning my fingers did you really so I always burn my fingers on stupid turkey I cook them too hot how long does Mr Leonard wait are you impatient yep I'm hungry so I don't burn fingers so does so I okay go that's what I'm thinking oh dang it okay so burn my fingers so my burn I'm a hot guy so uh let's see would one I burn I can touch things that are about Aver of coffee is 140 yeah right but coffee would burn my fingers if I put in there burn all the time so I'd say let's say 125° I think I do that I think I handle 125° we need to test that it's hot 125° is hot I don't know what you just said I imagine it has to do with food uh so I got the cook the water actually in my at my old house was like 130° and that would burn me so I'm guessing 125 I have to go okay but we we'll still stick with it so the temperature that's not going to apparently burn my fingers is 125° question where would the 125° go yes so for our model here for this particular turkey we'd have 125° equal 70 + 55 15 that's what I said 20 [Laughter] 23 31 T over 20 and then we start solving this thing uh to Omit time I'm just going to give you the answer because we're we're going to go over here we're already over here so we' subtract 7 we divide by 55 we take a natural log on both sides we would move our T over 20 to the front we'd multiply 20 IDE Ln of 23 31 and what you end up getting is a time of what did I do about 69.4 time it's minutes because we Define our time to be in minutes so in just over an hour I'm going to be able to cut this turkey and serve my guest some really dry it 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 9.1:  Convergence and Divergence of Sequences
all right we can to start something completely new uh we're going to start talking about chapter 9 in chapter 9 we talk about sequences and then Series this is a complete s side step from all the integration techniques that you've had up to this point we will be using them but it's not just integral after integral after integral Ed that's not what we're talking about here we're going to be talking about these two ideas called sequences and Series in this chapter and in the first section we're going to limit it just to sequences we'll talk about what a sequence is I'll show you how to get terms from a sequence get a sequence uh in sequence notation from a series of term from a sequence of terms um I'll also show you how to tell when a sequence will converge or diverge those two ideas are going to be very important for us in this chapter most of what we're going to be doing is testing for convergence or Divergence whether a sequence or series goes to a uh one number or whether it doesn't that's in the basic sense of things so in section 9.1 we are going to get a very indepth discussion of what sequences are all about again I'm going to try to teach this teach this to you because if you again if you're like me you didn't get a lot of exposure to this before right now uh which means that you might have seen a sequence before but you really don't know a whole lot about them we're going to learn a whole lot about them right now first thing what a sequence is so a sequence sequence typically denoted like this a subn it's a set of terms and the set of terms is based on well whatever this sequence is given to you as it's typically going to be first term second term third term and we denote those as a sub 1 a sub 2 a sub 3 all the way until we get a subn wherever we start n is always going to be a positive integer for us we we can't have the neg a negative term here so we say hey we have the first term it's it's a sub one sometimes you can do like the zeroth term a sub zero but typically we have a sub 1 a sub 2 a sub 3 a sub 4 so n is going to be our positive integer also these sequences can be denoted like this you don't see this very often at least not in our class it can be given to you like this where we say your 's going to start at a certain spot and it's going to end at a certain spot or it doesn't end we can denote a sequence like that so this says hey here's what you're going to be working with this is going to be some sort of a notation like n + 1 over n or n^2 over n factorial it's going to give you it's not just going to be a subn okay it's going to give you something there to work with then it says Hey I want you to start your n at three or at five or at one and I want you to end at seven or at 12 or I don't want you to end I want you to go forever and ever and ever and we'll talk about that does that make sense if this is not shown so if you don't have that then n starts at one so if this isn't here if not shown n starts at one now what I'd like to do is go through a couple of examples of just what sequences look like just so we can get the habit of listing out terms seeing what these things are actually doing would you guys like that be helpful because right now are you a little bit confused on what sequences are a littleit okay some of you probably have never seen sequences before so here we go here's an example what we're going to do is we're just going to start listing out some terms for the following sequences so here's how a sequence could look I want to make it look a little like what the heck just so you see that it's not that big of a deal list up terms they're very easy to list up terms okay that right there is something that's in sequence notation we have something that's do you guys see how this is in terms of n it says hey here's this the sequence in terms of n it says well where's the n g to start for us one why is it going to start at One automatically it's not noted if I'm not giving you anything over here this thing's going to start at one so here's how we find out the terms of our sequence it's not hard all it is is you start wherever I tell you to start if I don't tell you to starting where you start at one that would mean that our first term a sub one would happen when I plug in one for ourn so for instance go okay well uh what happens when when n is one that would be our first term what's going to happen when n is 2 what's going to happen when n is three or n is 4 or n is 5 by the way is this ever going to end for us so we're just going to list out the first five terms just to get a feel for it so if I want when n is one what I'm going to get out of here we're going to call this a sub one it's going to be my very first term it's going say the sequence of a so that's this thing when I've plugged in one or basically the first term of our sequence Jo P be okay with the idea here it's not hard to find out you just got to plug in one so let's plug in one where do we plug the one into again okay so um let's work through it what's n + 1 when n is 1 two how about1 to the second what's that one okay this would be 2 to the 1 how much is that would be 1 * 2 so we're going to have two over what one perfect yeah we're going to get one out of that you guys okay with that so far I'm going to erase that and put it one but that's where it's coming from it's just plugging in one and doing a little simplification so here's how we' say this the first term of our sequence or a sub one is one how we got it was we plugged in one for our n uh you don't have to show all this stuff basically we just show first term second term third term I'm just kind of denoting this so you understand where what all this stuff means okay a sub1 means the first term of our sequence a Nal 1 means well that's how you find the first term you plug in the one does that make sense let's plug in the two so this would be our a sub 2 or our second term of our sequence how you find the second term of our sequence is if you start at one you plugged in one if you start if you want to find the next term you're going to plug in what two for what and plug it and plug in the two so all right plug in the two if I do 2 + 1 notice I'm doing two here 2 + 1 is 1 to the third is okay so we know negative this is going to be negative basically that's all it's saying 2 to the 2 is so this will be negative 4 over we're pluging in two so the first term we got one the next term we got 4/3 here's my next question to you I want to see if you really paying attention here right first term was positive second term was negative third term what do you think that's going to be how about the next one how about the next one how about the next one is it going to do that forever yes because this right here that negative one that doesn't change value but it will change sign and says hey plug in a number and add one to it it's either going to be positive or it's going to be negative because we're going to get an even number or an odd number is an exponent does that make sense to you this right here gives us that alternating type of a sequence positive negative positive negative or negative positive negative positive my point is do you guys see that this is going to do that forever yeah okay so next term is going to be positive for sure let's check it uh how would I find a sub3 what would I plug in you just look at the pattern and go through say what oh never mind you got to do a first yeah but I'm saying I notic there's a pattern there it's going to be positive negative positive negative posi not only that but there's going to be a pattern for sure all these most of these things do have a pattern to them for us uh so plug in the three 3 + 1 four four 1 4 is positive it's positive I don't care if it's one or not it's going to be positive one or netive just telling it's positive because I'm multiplying by something right this is going to be eight so I'm going to have positive 8 over you guys okay with that one yeah let's do the fourth term why don't you do the fourth and the fifth terms for me okay try the fourth and the fifth terms for let's do that uh when you plugg in the fourth pluged in for the fourth term so basically when I'm looking for a sub4 I plug in four to my N I know if I plug in four 4 + 1 is 5 that's an odd number therefore I'm going to get a negative 1 5th is going to be a negative uh term here so this should be 16 over 5 Nega 16 over 5 did you get the same thing yes and lastly for a sub5 just plug in five I know my sign's going to change go from negative to positive because I'm taking hey look at that I'm taking 5 + 1 if I plug in an odd number it's going to add one to give me an even number any negative to an even number is going to become a positive so that's positive 2 5th is2 32 over 6 32 over 6 is 16 over 3 POS 163 okay really do need to show FC feel okay with that again is this sequence ever going to end no so we just found the first five terms but notice that it doesn't end forever you can do this forever andever it's always going to alternate positive negative positive have I explained well enough why it's alternating from positive to negative and then negative to positive and back and forth and back and forth have I explained that well enough for you here's my next question and let's look at a different a different sequence is this sequence going to alternate positive negative positive negative positive or negative negative positive is it going to do one of those things what tells you immediately that this is going to be an alternating sign on these terms right there that's it when you see this that's going to be alternating for sure because we're going to start off either with a positive or with a negative but the next one's going to be a different number right next one's going to take that negative one to a different consecutive number so if we start with an even the next one's going to be odd the next one's going to be even the next one's going be odd and then even odd and negative one to an even versus an odd is a difference between positive and negative should feel okay with with that one so we're going to have this idea again now next tell me something interesting that happens here that we didn't happened on our first sequence do you see why on this particular sequence I'm starting at two yeah yeah I mean if I started at one I had to get an i and well we're not talking about that in this class we're talking about real numbers so this would be undefined for the real number system does that make sense to you so we got to start at two for this one let's go ahead and I want you to figure out the first five terms of your sequence go for it first five terms you don't have to do anals 1 and equals you don't have to show me that you don't have to even show a sub 1 a sub 2 a I'm probably going to do the a sub 1 2 3 4 and 5 just so you see what what they are but you don't have to do that all I'm asking you to do is when you start here well we would start at a sub one we start at a sub two we'd start a sub 2 then we do a sub 3 a sub 4 a sub 5 and a sub 6 does that make sense yeah it will be the first term but it's a sub2 because that's our ter plug in bless you thank so I want the a sub two a sub 3 a sub4 a sub 5 and a sub six terms basically we're plug in in 2 3 4 5 and six it's not going to end we're going to stop but this thing doesn't end it goes to Infinity we just have to start with a sub 2 because it says well wait a minute you're starting at Nal 2 because we listen to our terms a subn you got to you got to signify that we're not going to put look at we're not going to put a sub one are we plugging in one no then you wouldn't put that you plug in two you got to have a sub2 that's where we're starting this particular sequence when you plugged in uh the two for your n what did you get zero Z 2 - 2 is z doesn't matter what the rest of it is it's going to be zero you okay with the zero yeah when we plug in the three well if I plug in three a sub3 means take your n and make it a three this is why our notation has to be correct because it's telling you what you just plugged in what you're supposed to plug in take that three uh what's 3 - 2 1 one okay now this is-1 to the N just to the 3 we don't have to add or subtract anything to it what's -1 to the 3 power positive or negative so this is going to be negative < TK 1 or 1 does that make sense to you did you make it that far yes good let's plug in the four if I want to find a sub 4 I'm going to plug in four 4 - 2 is 2 now now I'm going to do the fourth power remember this for four four goes here four goes here- 1 to the 4th is a positive 4 - 2 isun of two I don't know sleep I don't know what that is I'm not going to do 1.41 or anything I'm leave it square of two I want to be exact with this stuff quick head not if you're with with that one yes okay good two more a sub5 says all right take that five plug it in for your n so a subn a sub5 hey five goes here five goes here tell me am I going to get positive or negative netive yeah should be a negative 5 - 2 is 3 three I don't know leave it of three next up a sub 6 6 is going to go here six is going to go here so1 the 6 power positive or negative for sure 6 - 2 is 4 positive two it doesn't end it goes forever now here's what's interesting you will find patterns in these things first pattern we see is that the signs are changing positive negative positive negative positive negative second one this is just the square root of 0o the square root of one the square of two the square Ro of three the square root of four four next one will be negative square Ro T of 5 next one will be positive of 6 next one be negative and so on and so forth and so on and so forth forever and ever and ever and ever does that make sense to you they have a pattern to it of course it's a sequence it's based on one sequence here it's going to have to have some sort of a um sequential order to it of course we'd simplify them which takes away that look of a pattern doesn't it they don't look like it has a pattern so sometimes what that means is that if I give you this and I want this from you so right now I've given you the sequence I wanted the terms what if I gave you the terms and asked you for the sequence could you do it yes but it's uh it's a little bit harder cuz you're not given this to just plug numbers into now I want you to go from here and give me this sort of thing and that can get a little bit tricky so I'm going to walk you through a couple examples on how to do that but I want to make sure I've explained this well enough you understand what a sequence actually is so dep if I have feel okay with that questions what with the negative I'm not sure what the me on the top of the like I mean negative sorry uh infinity sign means it doesn't end oh okay so if I said hey you know what I just want uh up into n six we would have stopped right here not that make sense yeah okay let's keep on going so like I said we can go backwards too where if I give you a list of terms we should be able to find the sequence notation for that by the way it is appropriate I didn't do this but it is appropriate to when you're writing out a sequence to write these symbols as well to show that this is the sequence that we're getting here so we really should have that I didn't do it but we should have it say that is my sequence they're the same thing you okay with that one okay so as I was saying if I give you a sequence notation like this where you just plug in in this is pretty easy it's pretty straightforward is it straightforward to you yeah plug in the ends not a big deal but because these have a definite pattern to them that means that from our sequences given to his terby term rotation we should be able to get this thing back again and that's what I want to do with a couple examples here to give you the idea now naturally all these are going to be different some are going to be way harder than other ones all right some of you are going to be much better at others of you that makes sense than others because you're good at seeing patterns um I I struggled with this when I was taking this class man I can't see the pattern took me a lot of work uh it's hard sometimes to see these patterns I'm going to give you the way that I went through this um that helped me out a lot the first first thing I did was I listed out all the terms that were given to me so I would do like look like a nine supposed to be a I would list out what a sub 1 is a sub 2 a sub 3 a sub4 until they stop giving me terms can you tell me what is my a sub one everybody what's my a sub one good what's my a sub 2 very good and then 4 < TK 3 and five square sorry 5 over two the next thing I did was I tried to write them in all the same form what what I mean by the same form is look for a pattern that most of them have and some of them don't have and try to make them fit this this format what what I mean by that is this um most of our denominators have a square root of around them at least some of them do so what I'm going to try to do here is I'm going to try to make all the denominators have a square root around them does that make sense that'll give us an idea of a pattern so if I say hey you know what two wait a minute instead of two making yeah this is 2 over one moreover I can do two over root of one notice how I changed that term the look of that term not the not the value of it it's still the same thing right 2un one is still two but now it it more fits my pattern does that make sense to you this is how I did finding a pattern then I would do well this is pretty good this is 3 overun 2 no problem this is 4 over < tk3 that's not an issue this one's a little different though 5 over two I don't like thatare aha let's make that have a square root since that has a square root that has a square root probably this one's going to have a square root but but squ of two is not two TK of 4 is two show F feel okay with that one so your first idea my first idea was let's write out all the the terms boom boom boom boom let's try to make them have all the same pattern so if I seen some square roots here I know that my sequence probably has it has to have a square root somewhere in there does that make sense it's got to have one somewhere in there so if I have a square root for my denominators let's write our denominators having a square root 2 over 1 hey call of one two let's call itun of 4 now it's still of one of two of 3 of 4 so you okay with that one okay next idea try look for a pattern that is based on some sort of an N so the idea is ultimately try to relate your terms to some n now when I say N I don't mean some arbitrary number what I mean is look up here at the board here real quick what's your n Rel relate this to one relate this pattern to one what's your n relate this pattern to two what's your n relate to pattern three does that make sense to you so here's how I'm do what I mean by that I mean that well the first part of this for me at least is really easy because what's nice is that if I see one number that always matches up look at this look at the board right now one one hey one one 2 two hey 2 two 3 three that's great 4 four I don't have to change that that's brilliant so I know the of 1 and < TK of two and < TK of 3 and < TK of 4 means that I'm going to have a square Ro T so we want this right this is ultimately what we want to get to this is it if I have hey 1 one 2 2 3 3 4 4 then I'm going to have n n that's exactly right this is the idea we want to go from the specific to the general we're going from the inter the the exact terms to how can I do this every time and you can always double check your work okay always double check your work if I plug in one do I get that yes if I plug in two do I get that a sub two two hey if I plug in three I get this if I plug in four I get this so what I'm doing here is I'm trying to make all these things have the same format that way I can see a really easy pattern to it hopefully it relates easily to my ends some of them don't some of them are hard to see some are really easy to see this one I would say is easy one to see there's a one and a one a two and a two a three and a three and a four and a four you guys got it yeah now we got to do the same thing with the numerators here I got a two but I start with a one here I got a three but I start with a two here I got a four but I start with three here I got a five but I start with a four what's a relationship so this is really two is really 1 + 1 relate it to your end three is really look at this three is really 2 + 1 four is really 3 + 1 5 is really 4 + 1 a subn for the numerator is really n + 1 relate it to your n does that make sense to you yeah so your idea here and it's not as easy as probably I made it look okay this one was an easy example uh the idea is try to make them all the same format if you got square roots put square roots everywhere if you can do that okay try to relate it back to whatever your your index is so a sub one related it back to one related it back to two Rel it back to three to four and do that with both the numerator denominator whatever you have you're always trying to relate it back to the given end for that specific term if you can do that if you can write everything in terms of this index everything in terms of this index then it's really easy to write your your sequence in sequence notation you okay cool well look at what's happening this is 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 so this is n n n and n that means an N has to go here one one the one's not oh I forgot the one the one's not changing okay well the one's not changing we're just adding one to it this is NN n n that means an N has to go in the side of the square root that means that this sequence is represented by this sequence this is the sequence n + 1 < TK n the way that we do that we say hey you know what if we continue this pattern forever folks if we continue this pattern forever every term is going to be given by this this is the formula for every single term that is the formula for our sequence hands if I if you understand that cool you want to try another one yeah okay completely different topic from our integrals isn't it completely different right now we are going to see how integrals do take place in series not so much in sequences it's going to be more of a limit idea but we are going to see them eventually um but it's it's like AEP it's a different type of thinking process to me it's interesting it was hard the first time I saw it I really didn't grasp it all that well the first time I did this oh my gosh it's brand new so if you're strugging with that just know that you can you can get it uh but you have to kind of switch your mindset a little bit to It's thinking outside the box some of the times let's do one more okay so there's our sequence the first thing that I would consider doing is writing out I would blindly look for a pattern sometimes you can do that and sometimes oh my gosh that's so obvious to me that's cool if you're that type of person man more power too that's awesome uh for me I'm not all right I have to go through this process so for me I would write out a sub one I would write out a sub 2 a sub three a sub four how many I give you here five I'd write out all of them I'd go through the process so I start with just the terms themselves well I try to make them all the same format now the same format for me means that I've got fractions everywhere that's the idea so I got fractions so the only thing I do is I change this into a fraction after that there's no square roots I don't see any do you see any exponents I don't see exponents s seeing square root so as far as the format change that's all we can do the next thing is we got to try to relate this back to our n we have to do that so uh first thing first thing's kind of nice um I see something as far as my pattern tell me one thing that you see about the pattern here one top okay there's a one there's a one always on my numerator well that's going to make it kind of nice right sign change oh sign change that's right so sign change so here's here's the one thing I know right now I know that my sequence is going to have terms where there's going to be a one on the numerator that's what I know you guys know that too right okay well then now that's going to change right it's sometimes be negative one sometimes going to change to be a positive one so I know that here it's negative but here it's positive here it's negative but here it's positive here it's negative but here it's positive it's going to change uh the whole way through this here's how we deal with that alternating idea the alternating signs idea remember the first two Ser sequences I gave you it was negative 1 to a power you're going to either do 1 to the N or1 to the n + one depending on whether you start with a positive or negative so let's think of about it do we start with a positive or A negative remember that we're always going back to whatever our n is here our n is one so what I want to know is that which one which one is going to give us a positive sorry a negative for the first term and a positive for the second term if I plugged in one here if I plugged in one here I'd get 1 + 1 is 2 1^2 is positive that would not be the correct case here if we take away that plus one basically we get this one we plug in n = 1 1 to the first is still Nega 1 that means that's going to give us this one if I plug in a two here it would give me a positive okay if I plug in a three here it give me a negative okay four here positive five here negative I'm always relating it back to my n whatever the index is does that make sense to me you sure that's another piece of our puzzle so we're going to do something real quick instead of having this one up here would you be okay if I just did1 to the end yes that's either going to give us a positive one or negative one I know the numerator is going to be one or negative one but this this this gives it to us let's double check before we go any further okay double check our numerators relate it back to our index if I plug in one do I get negative one yes yes so I can move those up here even if you want if that's helpful to you do it if I plug in one I get 1 if I plug in two do I get positive one I plug in three do I get negative 1 four do I get positive one five do I get eight you know what it's going to work then that's our we already done our numerator now it's just the denominator so let's work on the denominator take each piece of this and relate each piece back to your n your index now right now that looks like the n and that looks like the N right does this one look like the N so I can't just put Over N so I put over n the first two would be right the rest would be wrong I've got to have something that's right for all of them so let's try to relate this sometimes it's nice to not look at the first one doesn't really give you a whole lot of information here let's look at maybe um look at maybe the second one on down do you see a pattern out of that what do you see specific how do you get from 2 to 6 how do you get from 6 to 24 how do you get from 24 to 120 how do you get let's try easy one okay don't add to it because this is not addition here how do you get from two to six multiply by how do you get from 6 to 24 how do you get from 24 to 120 five so what this is doing it's taking the previous number it's multiplying it by your n now hang on a second so this would take the previous the pre the previous number doesn't exist it just multiplies it by one one takes the previous number look at please look please follow the pattern here takes a previous number and multiplies it by remember you're always ring back to your n do you got it always this is where it's going to get interesting please listen carefully the previous number is 1 * 2 correct it multiplies it by n the previous number is 1 * 2 * 3 correct it multiplies it by n the previous number is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * it multiplies it by factorial ah now we're getting somewhere can we rep repr this better yes this says take n multiply by every number before that that's what this is doing it says this number is 2 * this one this one's 3 * this one this one's four times well all the previous ones because that's how we're getting those ones we're getting them by multiplying the ends from every previous term does that make sense to you this is how you find the pattern though it's not that easy to look at it most people unless you're really good at factorials would see one 2 3 4 and 5 factorial I did because I've done the problem before uh but probably not if you're first going through it you got to really look at that pattern does that make sense to you if we do look at the pattern and go hey look at that this is 5 factorial four factorial this is 1 over 1 factorial this is 1 / 2 factorial this is -1 over 3 factorial this is 1 over 4 factorial this is1 over five factorial by the way if you don't know what factorial means this is not five okay this is a five factorial I know it's exciting almost good to talk about radicals but uh but it's not this is five factorial means 5 * 4 * 3 * it's uh a product of the number that I give you and every previous consecutive integer until you get down to one so when we relate this back to our n we've already taken care of our numerator it's great it's alternating one not a problem denominator starts with N Factor that's what it is therefore this sequence every term of this sequence a subn this is what you're looking for you're looking for a subn every term is given by this and you should definitely double check your work before you go any further make sure when you plug in these numbers you get the same thing that'd be really silly to do this and have wrong okay plug in one go uh yes that gives me one plug in two and that gives you 1 12 plug in three that gives me6 you should be doing that okay after you've done it You' verified it this is what goes inside your sequence notation -1 to the N Over N factorial and we just solve have I explained well enough how to find your sequences from your terms that's way harder than finding your terms from your sequence okay that's pretty easy just plug numbers in very straightforward that Way's kind of hard now I want to give you a couple other ideas before I I leave you today the first one is a kind of an interesting idea sometimes we can Define sequences by giving one or two or three or four or finite number of fixed terms and then defining our sequence around those terms for instance if that's like what in the world did you say in English uh here's what I said in English give me a couple numbers uh like two and four let's pick two and four so don't give me nothing I'll do it on my own thanks a lot guys so I say a sub 1 is 2 2 a sub 2 is 4 I'm not looking for a pattern right now I'm not thinking that a sub 3 is 8 or 6 okay I'm not thinking that here's what I'm going to Define for the rest of them I say based on these two terms your next term a sub n + 1 your next term is given by 2 * a subn minus a sub nus1 you go what in the world is this this is called a recursive sequence it's called recursive because it relates back to the previous terms a recursive idea is look back at what you had and build from there it's based on what happened before it so this is called a recursive sequence what I the only thing I'd like to do right now is U come up with the next few terms so let's see how this actually works it's not hard it looks weird okay it really does look weird but I want you to think about what's going on here if you're wondering wow what is this a sub n + one that just means your next term so for instance for instance what terms do I know right now a sub 1 a sub2 that's what I know so what term would I be looking for so watch carefully a sub3 would therefore be equal to check out this the way the recursive formula works it says if you want a sub3 you're going to consider a sub3 to be a sub oh here's that would be 2 + 1 so then a subn would be just the one before it a sub 2 minus oh look at this a sub nus 1 would be a sub 1 did you guys get that idea where those things came from from yeah are you sure yes if this is my formula this is my recursive sequence it says if this is a three if this is a three that's one more than two this is one more than one so I'm looking these terms a sub 1 a sub 2 oh that's a sub3 do you see how it's based on the previous terms there it's based on what I give you if I change these two numbers this whole sequence changes so P feel okay with that idea let's find it so a sub3 therefore would be 2 * what's a sub 2 four minus what's a sub 1 which means that a sub3 is oh look at that it didn't turn out to be six how about that interesting let's find two more I'll do one more with you you do one your own a sub4 it might be helpful for you to right now write out what I did here first this will give you a much better idea what's going on right now so watch this please I know that a subn +1 says hey take two * the pre that's that's all this means it just means the previous term this is a sub3 this is a sub 2 this is be a sub 1 if this is a sub 4 this is a sub 3 and this is a sub it's just the previous two terms so this would be 2 * a sub 3 - a sub 2 if that makes sense to you you got it do you got it are you sure you got it for for that last one we did did we have done n * a sub nus1 like n * the previous answer or would it not work in this is literally what that means did you catch that yeah I was just wondering if we that not this is this is a factorial if you didn't think about that start with the number take one away from it take two away from it take three away from it multiply them all together till you get down to one we're actually going to use this in a minute so are there different ways you can Define your sequence yeah probably um but we're going to try to do the nicest way that makes sense did that answer your question at all I'm talking about doing the a sub just saying to Define this one recursively say like a sub one is1 um I don't know that you'd want to I think that I'd probably want to stick with this way and not if I don't want have to Define recurly I'm probably not going to because I want to formula to be able to find the tell tell you what we want to do you want to be able to find the 10th term without having to find the first nine okay um you can't do that with recursive sequences most of the time because you'd have to know the previous couple terms right find the 10th term you'd have to know here number nine and number eight does that make sense so if you can do it without recursive I would say do it without recursive now let's finish this off uh real quick do you all understand where the A sub3 and A sub2 came from yes that's all this says is the previous two terms so in our case we'd have two hey what's a sub3 notice how you had to know that before you did this a sub 2 so a sub4 = 8 how about a sub 5 a sub 5 would be 2 * a sub 4- a sub3 it's just the previous two terms this is the idea of a recursive sequence now please listen carefully is it always a previous two no it can be different it can be the previous term and then three before that you just have to have it defined okay so a sub5 = 2 what's a sub4 8 minus a sub3 6 a sub5 therefore is so we know that this sequence goes like this it goes 2 4 6 8 10 and it never stops it's just the even numbers that's exactly what that is so if F feel okay with this idea all right good deal so continuing on with our section we're going to talk today about the limit of a sequence and what that infers as far as convergence and Divergence so what we need to know is that if we have a SE sequence a subn we can find the limit of the sequence and it's going to be written as the limit of a subn we'll do some examples on what this means in just a little bit as n approaches Infinity you see these sequenc sequences like this are implied to start oh we learn this last time implied to start where if I don't tell you anything it starts at and it goes to so what we're trying to find out is what's happening to our sequence as we get bigger and bigger and bigger is the sequence getting bigger and bigger and bigger forever or smaller and smaller and smaller forever more negative or is it tending to be towards one value and that's what this limit idea is going to tell us whether our sequence is going to one number hence it will be convergent if a limit exists or if it's going to infinity or negative infinity or whether the limit doesn't exist in that case it would be diver diverent that's exactly right so to find out what's happening to our sequence we take a limit for the limit of our sequence we're going to have a couple results where I put that if the limit exists so equals an actual number then we say that that limit then the sequence is convergent so if the limit of our sequence as n approaches Infinity exists then the sequence is convergent if the limit does not exist so it does not exist or is infinity so if not I'll say it this way so if the limit does not exist to some number if it's infinity or negative Infinity so if not then the sequence is Divergent now a couple properties that I'm going to go through super fast these are old properties for limits I just want to refresh your memory on what these things first is this is this okay is this explained well enough for you to understand that trying to figure out what's happening to our sequence right so we're going to take a limit as the terms as the terms go towards Infinity as end approaches Infinity so way out there we're going to see if it approaches a number or not if it apprach is a number hey it's convergent if not it's Divergent that's basically it now the properties of limits so we're going to suppose in each case that the limit of a subn and limit of B subn exist here's what we can do with our limits first one if you have a limit with some constant times your sequence what you need to know is that anytime you have a constant next to your your sequence or whatever your expression is in terms of one variable in this case it would be n you can pull that constant in front of your limit next one if you have a limit of two sequences added together we can separate limits by addition number three says likewise we can also separate limits by multiplication well if we can separate limits by multiplication then we can probably separate limits by division and we sure enough can and lastly number five number five is a really cool one I love this one it says that if you have a limit of some sequence to a power we'll call it P you can actually take that power outside of your limit as well so if you have a limit of a subn to the P power the whole thing's being raised to a power this is the same thing as taking the limit of a subn and raising the entire thing to the P power so here's a basic rundown on our properties for limits it says that we can pull constants out of our limits not a problem we can separate limits by addition we can separate limits by subtraction we can separate limits by multiplication we can separate limits by division we can do a lot of things of limits we can even if we have a sequence raised to a power we can take a limit of the sequence without the power and then take the the resultant after that after that limit to that power show F feel okay with the idea okay so we're going to be using those uh I know that you've seen them before there is one qualification for this um a subn has to be positive and P has to be positive so we got to check for those as well now what I'd like to do is I'd like to go through some examples of how to tell when our sequences are going to be convergent or Divergent so here's what we're going to be going to this is just what we're going to be using some of the times to deal with these limits so the idea is going back to this it says if you get a sequence let's find out what happens at the end of our sequence there is no end but towards Infinity what's going to happen with that you guys ready to do a couple examples so we're going to try to show convergence or Divergence so number one let's say I give you a very simple sequence a very simple sequence like that one -1 to the N can you tell me what the terms of this sequence are going to be if I were to write out the terms like we practiced last time what's the first term going to be one or negative 1 we'd start with one right so 1 to the first power is 1 what's the next term going to be what how about after that and do you see it's going to alternate forever and ever and ever and ever and ever be negative 1 1A 1 1A 1 1 1 1 negative 1 now do that for eternity okay what's it going to be doing after eternity still wait is it still one it's going to one what's it what's it doing it's going 1 1 one is it ever getting closer to one particular number no it's going 1 1 one and if you do this for eternity it's still going to be doing one negative 1 one negative 1 one is it ever going to one specific number no then this limit can't possibly exist this would be Divergent go one negative 1 one it's never going to a specific number does that make sense to you so this would say yeah no there's no way this is Divergent and that shows Divergence good enough with that one now for the other ones this was very simple I just want to give you the idea that not everything is convergent and not everything when you take a limit of it this is one example of this not everything when you take a limit of it goes to infinity a number or negative Infinity that's not what happens this one doesn't go to a specific number this is one where the limit does not exist does not go to Infinity does not go to negative Infinity it goes to one or negative one and over and over again it's not going to specific number the limit just doesn't exist show F if you understand the concept there now for the rest of them well we have a much more concise way to do this without writing terms we don't have to write terms with these here's what it says if our sequence a subn is given by this 2 N / n +1 all we've got to do is take the limit of that sequence as n approaches Infinity if the limit exists what do we know about that sequence did I not explain this let me explain if the limit exists we know the sequence is okay so let's say we take the limit of this thing and it exists what do we know about the sequence good what if the limit does not exist or goes to infinity or negative Infinity that's the idea here so we don't have to list out all the terms that's not what this says this says hey take your sequence here's your sequence find a limit as n approaches Infinity let's find a limit as n approaches infinity and if this is limit exists we know that we've just proved convergence I I need to make sure that you guys are okay with do you guys see that this this right here is exactly what we're doing does take the limit of your sequence we're takeing the limit of our sequence this is our sequence right here this would give us our terms right this would give us a first term second term third term all the way into Infinity we just need to do it once and for all we say okay well now let's let's find out what's happening to our terms remember that our this sequence is giving us our terms correct let's find out what happens to our terms as we take our nend to Infinity that's the plan now how are we going to do something like that you actually could yeah you could do L there's nothing that says you can't do lit talls with this uh first you got to verify something it's Infinity over it is infinity over infinity you could easily do a lowy talls with this not a problem you could also do some old school stuff could you divide everything by the largest power in the denominator you could do that so if you divide everything by n if you divide everything by n we'd get 2 N / N we' Get N / n + 1/ n you can do it that way or you can do the L tall way since we've just done L this way it's probably going to be nice for us what's the derivative of 2 N what's the derivative of n + 1 what's that limit two notice that if you were to do this n / n is 1 n / n is 1 2 * 1 gives you two what's 1/ n as n appr infinity so this gives you one uh sorry this gives you 2 * 1 this gives you one this whole thing is two as well remember this thing goes to zero either way you're going to get the two it doesn't really matter for that particular case so F be okay with this one now here's my question is this does this show convergence or does this show Divergence why perfect now does it say that this whole sequence equals to sequence is a list of terms you can't say it equals anything it equals what it equals it equals all the terms up to the infinity term okay now what I can tell you is that as we get close to Infinity those terms are all going to be really close to two that's what's going to happen so I don't know what it's going to what the actual terms are okay but I know they're going to be really close to two as we get towards Infinity does that make sense to you so what we all we're showing here we're not showing what this equals we're saying the limit exists therefore we have proven convergence for this particular sequence and we just say that sequence is convergent okay let's do number three 2 +1 to the N Over N goodness gracious uh ladies and gentlemen how can we check for convergence or Divergence of a sequence what should we do take limit limit don't we love the limits no not really we can do them because we we've learned it from calculus one so let's go ahead let's take the limit of our sequence what we know is that if we take the limit as n approaches Infinity of whatever our sequence is if this limit exists we have proven convergence if the limit does not exist goes to infinity or goes to something like this we've proven that it's divergent or it have we've shown Divergence um ideas isn't anything with thetive 1 to the N automatically Divergent because no no it doesn't because What's Happening Here is because you're taking 2 + one or 2 minus one that's different okay so this particular thing this thing yeah it is doing this but when we combine it with everything else maybe it doesn't diverge maybe it is convergent we don't know we can't just automatically jump to it so don't jump to it okay go through the process of actually finding out where the limit exists that would be a good good question but really bad idea to do that now is this Infinity over infinity no no no it's not this is 2 plus or minus one over infinity okay that's that's that's way different so we can't use a Lyal rule all the time which is why I gave you this idea you're like why is he bringing that up well I'm bringing this idea up because sometimes we might have to actually do that in our limits lals doesn't work all the time it's not our fail safe every single time you guys with me on that one so when you have something like man I have no idea this is something over infinity well uh to prove it if you're really kind of thinking about this you probably already have the answer you probably already see what's going to go on to really show it though you could divide everything by n the largest power in the denominator if you do that we get a limit as n approaches Infinity of 2/ n plus -1 to n/ n all over what's this going to be it's going to be one it's going to be n / n which is one now let's think about this how much is 2 over n as n approaches Infinity how much is that something thing zero now how about this one what's 1 to the N / n as n approaches Infinity this is also zero I don't care what that is whether it's one or NE 1 if I divide it by Infinity it's going to be zero does that make sense to you over can you do Z over one no can you do one over zero can you do Z over one this is 0 over one or zero that's what it's saying what it's saying is that as you're going to towards Infinity with your terms all of those terms are going to get really close to what number yeah I don't know what the terms are okay but I know that they're going to get really close to zero does the limit exist do we know the limit equals well yeah we do do we know the sequence equals no it's it's a it's a sequence of terms okay we're not adding them we're not subtracting them it's just it's a list of terms uh but we do know that that sequence is going to converge we have shown convergence show hands feel okay with that by the way I mentioned briefly that some of you if you're really thinking about it it could have shown that here that's a constant right that's a constant what's a constant over Bam could have probably seen it right there to show it mathema should be okay you can do this too but uh you probably could have seen it have I explained these well enough for you one through three you want to try a couple more give you some different ideas here I kind of like these CU they go way quicker right now than some of the other stuff that we've been doing that take 35 steps to do it's kind of nice nice little break how about a sub n equal Ln of n n oh goodness okay uh tell me the first thing that we should do in order to test whether this thing is going to be convergent or Divergent what would we do take the limit very good so let's take the limit of our sequence where's our limit going zero I'm sorry where's our n going Infinity yeah we're trying to find out what happens as we get towards Infinity now we don't want to find out the first finite number of terms because we could literally do that we could plug in the hundredth term and see what it is or the millionth term we could see what it is what we're looking for is what's happening as we get infinitely large we don't have ever have to go to negative Infinity because n is defined as being positive right so positive integers don't worry about negative it's always positive that's nice for sequences we're always growing from one um tell me something about the limit of lnn Over N almost sounds likeing lnnn n whatever lnn Over N uh what is it Infinity over infinity what we're going to use for Infinity over infinity in this case yeah use the L TS when you can I did I didn't do it here so I could bring back another idea but shoot I mean if I was actually doing this problem for real I would definitely do ly TS absolutely anytime you have the infinity over infinity when you have those polinomial and you can actually take a derivative or you have an Ln and you can take a derivative or some function you can take a derivative do it so we do a lital rule and we get the limit as n approaches Infinity of what's the derivative of how about thetive of how much is 1 over n as n approaches Infinity so this thing goes as 0 over one how much is 0 over one is this sequence convergent or Divergent convergent because because why Zer because the limit exist exists because it exists that's why so we just shown this sequence is [Applause] converged still okay so far let's do one more and then I'll talk about something else a couple of the ideas that we can use good ideas okay so we're trying to show whether these sequences are convergent or Divergent the first thing that we got to do is take a limit because we know if the limit exists it's convergent and if it doesn't exist it's Divergent so number one thing we're going to try is let's do a limit as n approaches Infinity that's what we're trying to look at what's happening to our sequences we get way out there of this now we Pro I'm guessing that you probably haven't seen stuff like this in a while do you remember what to do when you have like a difference of radicals or a sum of radicals the conjugate that's a great word a conjugate would be an excent idea if we do the conjugate here um by the way we I don't want you to just plug in infinity and go oh well it's Infinity minus infinity zero maybe it might be zero I don't know but you got to show it okay you can't take guess like that so anyway a conjugate is a really good idea for this what it does is it makes it into a fraction for you and simplifies a lot of either the numerator or denominator depending on what you're conjugating do you guys remember the conjugate idea for Radicals now that we've seen it again yes we do the same exact radicals the sign is different that's the that's the way that conjugates or if you want to be fancy conjugate uh that's the way just joking that's the way these conjugates work that kills in my math C Class just so you know actually what is that really what it is just joking so when we distribute this thing uh notice that the reason why we use a conjugate is because we get this idea of a like a almost get different squares out of that uh the middle terms are gone so they simplify also a square root time a square root gives you the radican so we get n +1 minus n over you just leave the entire denominator because what has happened here is by multiplying by the conjugate we no longer have an infinity minus infinity we actually change that to an infinity plus an infinity and that we can actually do Infinity minus infinity I don't know infinity plus infinity that's definitely Infinity does that make sense to you also what happens with our numerators one we get one so we've get one we've got one over how much is this denominator for sure how much is one over infinity Z actually turned out that it was Zero but we had to show it um by the way if it equals z Z we got a lot of those do do the limits always equal zero obviously not but if they do equal a number what do we know about the sequence good since the limit exists we know convergence I want to Quick show hand you feel okay with with these ideas so use what you know about the limits to to find out whether the sequences are convergent or Divergent all we got to do is take the sequence find the limit of that sequence if it exists cool you know that sequence is convergent when we get toward towards Infinity those terms are all around one particular number if we do it and we the limit does not exist like that one that means as we go towards Infinity the terms are not all around one number they're either growing without bound decreasing without bound or they're alternating like like this one is they're not going to a specific number in that case we'd show Divergence of our sequence and that's basically the idea now we have a couple other ways to do this if we can't for instance find the limit really easily we can use some techniques to not cheat but be really smart about showing a comparison of a couple limits comparison to a couple sequences maybe one way that we can do this is with what's called The Squeeze theorem you ever heard of The Squeeze theorem yeah you take this limit that's bigger you take this limit that's smaller you this limit that's right in the middle and you squeeze it and go haha sucker you're going to have to go to the if both these limits go to One Thing the limit in the middle it's got to go to that one thing we can't have these limits go somewhere and this one go nuh okay it's got to go to where these go all right that's what the squeeze theem does and I'm going to give you what the squeeze theorem says I'm going to show you how the squeeze theorem Works in just a bit so let's suppose that we've got three sequences we have a subn we got B subn and we got C subn do you notice that the B subn is in between a subn and C subn for every single term this is what this means so this means that every for all these terms and all these terms sequentially this one's always going to be between them every single time so for the first term it's this scenario for the second term it's the scenario and every single time every single term until we get to Infinity it's always going to be a subn smaller than b subn b subn smaller than C subn does that make sense furthermore let's assume that the limit of a subn equals the limit of c subn and that those limits both exist that's why I'm putting l there that it's actual existence of those limits they exist does that make sense to you so far did I just lose you I don't L you here uh it says that hey suppose that this is the scenario we got the the sequence we're going to be trying to show right now is the B subn we're going to assume that we know what this limit is that it exists we're going to assume that we know what the limit of this sequence is and that exists and that these two limits are the same so basically these two are going to the same number does that make sense they're both going to L well if that's the case if the limit of a subn goes to l and the limit of C subn goes to L and approaches Infinity tell me something about the limit of b subn as n approaches Infinity L it has to go to L it's it's squeezed between them so again this says these two guys these are doing this a sub's going to one number B sub's going to the same sorry C sub I misspoke a sub's going one number c subn is going to the same number B subn is somewhere between those guys right somewhere between there so if these are going like this to one number at Infinity this one's also got to go there does that make sense to you that's the way they squeeze there basically works so let me show you an example about how we can actually use it it's going to take us some time um do you have any questions on this so far I'm going to leave this one to start over here questions on these ones are they straightforward to you mhm good okay I actually asked you for questions before I erased it this time learning you I'm going to call it uh yeah call as let's do that we got a subn equals n Over N the N I'm so excited factorials Super no it's not n n it's n factorial now here's the thing if we were to go through the same process that we just did the idea of finding out whether this sequence is convergent or Divergent would be well uh you take a limit wouldn't you wouldn't you yes so we'd say hey what's the limit as n approaches Infinity of n factorial Over N the n and you think about it go okay uh as we code to Infinity we're going to have hey what's n factorial is n approach Infinity infity what's n to the N is n approaching Infinity infity no it's definitely INF Infinity to the infinity is going to be Infinity all right okay so we have an Infinity over infinity tricks me with this however when if we divide by the largest power in the denominator we're dividing by n to the N right we'd get exactly the same thing over again we get n plus n factorial over end of n over one that wouldn't help us if we try to do lal's rule this thing explodes this thing we don't know how to do derivatives of n factorial so maybe we have a better way if we have those factorials go oh my gosh I have no idea maybe try to do a squeeze THM on it try to find something that is smaller than this and something that is bigger than this so here's what I know I'm going to start off on one you know what I'm going to do I'm start off right here on one side I'm going to use the rest of the board to kind of work down to here the one thing I know is that this is always going to be positive would you agree with that always positive so I know right the bat that Z is less than or equal to my sequence that's what I know now the goal then is to find some other sequence that goes right here that the limit of it is what not one I'm trying to squeeze it right if I have if I'm going to squeeze something these two limits the limits of these sequences have to be the same so since I've bounded this below by zero oh zero it's got to be zero if the squeeze theem is going to work it would have to be do you understand the squeeze theem yes if I say uh hey tell you what um one sequence goes to zero and one goes to 100 what's this one go to I don't know how supposed to know that I don't have no idea doesn't make any sense if I say this one goes as one and this one goes to one and this one goes to one that's how sque works so we're trying to go to the same number so if I say I know that this is positive therefore it's always greater than or equal to zero not a big deal I also need to find a sequence over here that the limit of that sequence goes to zero as well that's when the squeeze theem is going to work for us you guys with me on this now in order to get started maybe we start by looking at the first few terms of what the sequence actually is doing we didn't have to do that with our previous examples but here it might be a good idea also I'll tell you this when I'm looking at terms of my sequence I'm not simplifying them I do not simp simplify them and make it like one number over another number I leave them in their form that I'll show you right now I'll leave them in my form that way I can see the pattern and maybe come up with some uh comparison so for instance a sub 1 gives me 1 over 1 to the 1 does that make sense yes I know that equals one but I'm going to leave it right here uh this a sub 2 gives me 2 * 1 over 2 2 * 2 2 the 2 power that's right 2 the second power or 2 * 2 does that make sense to you a sub3 gives me 3 * 2 * 1 do you guys know what factorial means 3 * 2 * 1 over 3 3r right but that would be 3 * 3 * 3 does that make sense to you yes no yes no okay so here's here's the thought I'm gonna do something kind of tricky if I think about this I know that this one is always going to be less than or equal to 2 * 2 over 2 * 2 isn't it and this one's always going to be less than or equal 2 3 * 3 * 3 over 3 * 3 * 3 isn't it you sure now one more thing this is going to be kind of interesting here because the last number of a factorial is always one always do you understand that last number in the factorial is always one I can actually eliminate this last term and it's still right does that make sense to you you can try it with a sub4 a sub4 would be uh let's see 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 over 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 I know that's less than or equal to 4 * 4 * 4 but look it the last number is one I don't even need that over 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 here's what I'm trying to get you to see if I do a subn a subn would be n factorial Over N to the N well what I know is that this is equal to sorry less than or equal to the denominator I'm not going to change but here's what I know about the numerator the numerator is always going to be less than n to to the not n to the n n the nus one I know that for sure um I get a different way for you guys to see that too if you want if you want to look at at it differently so uh other if that just B did that blow your mind or were you able to follow that did you get that how many people got that feel okay about that did I blow anybody's mind like oh my gosh what in the world is happening okay um check it out let's think about what n factorial means let's think about what n the N means would you agree that this is always less than or equal to this one always because this is n * n -1 * N - 2 time forever does that make sense but this one is n * n * n forever does that make sense to you are you sure now listen carefully if you didn't get this the first time here's the whole idea okay here's the whole idea how many terms are here all the way to how many terms are going to be there Infinity not Infinity I'm going to go to n so if I give for instance if I gave you three how many terms are here three if I give you four how many terms are here four four there's going to be n terms here there are they're n terms n terms do you guys get me on that one are you sure how many n's are going to be over here same n there's going to be n terms now here's the part where we think a little bit do you agree that the last term over here is going to be one mhm okay so there's n terms but the last one is one one is going to be less than or equal to any number in the world any number a whole number uh whole integer number positive in the world got qualify that a little bit uh basically it's going to be less than any one of these correct so because our last term over here is n and our last term over here is one I can take away this last N I can take away that last n and I'm still bigger than this because my last term here is one does that make sense to you so then I'm going to say tell you what this had n terms but this would still be true if I had less than so here's n terms here last term is one and then I did this where only have n minus one terms so I say let's compare these I know this is true I know this is always going to be greater than equal to this one obviously this is counting down this is 543 2 1 this is 55555 this one's always going to be bigger than that understood however I can be a little bit better I can say well I know that if this is 5 4 3 2 1 that last one who cares I can do 5555 and it's always still bigger than that because the last term here is one does that make sense to you so I go all right well I think about this as n factorial but I think about this as not n the N how about n the N minus one so what this gives us is that n factorial is less than or equal to n to the please listen carefully so you understand where I'm getting this from this if this has n terms this is n to the N does that make sense to you if this has nus one terms this is n to the nus one show P if feel okay with that is that a little bit did I explain a little bit better for you the second time around questions if you have them are you sure because I want you to get it before I go any further it's kind of an important idea I'm going to keep this on the board just work right down here all right well then if this is true what we know about inequalities is if I divide both sides by the same thing as long as it's not negative I still have a valid inequality since n the N is always positive I'm divided by a positive my inequality is still good we okay with this one now here's the cool part about this can you find the limit as n approaches Infinity of n nus1 n n yeah yeah we can do that actually um what we would do is we we would now divide by the largest power in the denominator if we divide by n to the n on both the numerator and denominator we get a limit as n approaches Infinity of well this would be n n -1 Over N N All Over N the N Over N oh my gosh there's a lot of n's that was really stupid why did I do that that was really dumb I'm sorry I was just going through my process that was that was ridiculous um we can we can do it a lot easier than that actually write that down edit uh what did I want to do oh yeah if you think about what this is think about what n to the N is if I split off one n just one n then this is n nus1 * n do you buy into that one what do you do when you multiply common bases you add the exponents what's n -1 + 1 hey this is true then what's n nus1 over n nus one this is gone you get one how much is the limit of 1/ n as n approaches Infinity Z that's zero so let's put all of this stuff together what we know from here is that 0 was less than a to the N uh a sub n we now know that a subn is less than well it was less than this this sequence n nus1 over n n because the limmit of this what's the limit of zero zero what's the limit of this one because this goes to zero and because this goes to zero this says that the limit of a subn as n approaches Infinity goes to zero what's that tell you about our sequence is it convergent or is it Divergent it's convergent I can tell by some of the looks on your faces uh some of them are like and some are like you just kind of gave up on the problem I want to make sure that you get it all right uh I don't want to just leave you hanging on this stuff that's right leave you hanging on this de de stuff did you get the idea at all yeah what's whatsoever or are we just it's just processing stuff there a lot right there a lot of stuff that we just did we learned about the squeeze Thum squeeze Thum says uh these go here this goes here so we make it up we go okay cool uh I know that zero I know that my sequence is going to be greater than Z I know that because I just looked at my terms look at this look at my terms this is n factorial right look at the terms please this is n to the N minus one I'm I'm stopping before the last one this is still true this is still less than this well that shows you that n factorial Over N to the N is less than n the N minus I'm stopping before the last term n minus one hey hey look at that we got the same thing there uh n minus one I'm stopping before the last term because the last term here is one it's not make a difference what I have this is always it's still going to be a valid inequality the limit of this guy is zero you got it just showed it right there just showed it right here just split off the n n nus 1 * n this is still n the N these are gone we get one over n limit of that zero so I've shown that Z goes to zero I've now shown that a subn is less than or equal to this a subn is less than or equal to this but this guy goes to zero therefore if 0 the limit of 0 is 0 the limit of this is zero therefore we now have a subn bounded between two sequences two different sequences but both of them go to the same thing zero goes to zero this limit or the limit of this sequence goes to zero therefore the limit of our sequence itself goes to zero and that proves that that thing is convergent and that's the idea so fans feel at least a little bit okay about that one okay any questions all before I move on you see what I want to give you right now is two um two pieces of information that are very useful for you that we can use all the time from from here on out here they are any last last chance because it's all going bye-bye did you get this got that idea that's kind of cool right split that off okay so two notes with uh a couple examples very very fast examples here this one is very cool we're actually going to use this later on as well in series uh but here's what you need to know if the limit of the absolute value of the sequence equals zero then the limit of the sequence itself also equals z you're like so what firstly why in the world what are you K are you kidding me here's what this is I I'll give you kind of a rundown okay look if you have a limit if you have a limit where you take the absolute value and equals z if you have something that looks like this where it's going positive negative positive negative positive negative positive negative if you change all these two absolute value you get something that looks like this does that make sense down to zero so this says if the limit of the absolute value of sequence goes to zero then even though this sequence originally looked like this that's still going to zero that's what that says so the way we use it is with something like this one you okay cool let's talk about the limit as n approaches Infinity so suppose we get this sequence -1 to the N / n suppose we're given that and we go okay show convergence or Divergence you I don't even know because it's alternating right I I don't know well I mean you could just divide everything but or you could think about it this is alternating between one anda1 that's a constant number this is infinity it's going to be zero for sure but we can actually prove it with with this and this is very useful a lot of the times well just consider this one consider the limit as n approaches Infinity of -1 to the N Over N in absolute value consider that one tell me what happens ladies and gentlemen with1 to the N if I put it inside absolute value what's it going to be it's not going be zero it's going to be one it says hey take positive one take the absolute value it's one take negative one take the absolute value it's one N I don't care what what we do with n because absolute value a positive number is always positive so it's really not for the n n is always positive does that make sense to you always positive therefore this would be equivalent to the Limit as n approaches Infinity of 1/ n tell me what's the limit as n approaches Infinity of 1/ n absolutely and here's where our little theorem comes in it says check it out says take your sequence whatever you had take the absolute value of your sequence okay here's our sequence let's take the absolute value of our sequence if this limit works out to be zero What's it tell you about this limit z z so the limit as n approaches infinity1 n / n is also zero if the limit of the absolute value of our sequence equal zero AB sequence equals z the limit of the sequence itself also equals z show feel okay with that one that's real nice to get rid of thetive 1 to the N real fast you can do that a lot okay and we will be doing that a lot okay last one we actually already used this very cool little theorem here it says if you have a continuous function and you have a limit of a sequence exists as n approaches Infinity then if you have a composition so basically you have this okay you have a sequence look at look the bo here real quickly so I explain this you have a sequence whose limit exists inside of a continuous function function we've actually used this before you will notice on the next example that we do we've seen this before we had e to the Ln we had we had sorry we had limit of e to some function we pulled the E outside the function remember we doing that I said oh you can do that because it's continuous I never really proved it I never really showed it here's the reason why if you have a function that is continuous continuous and you have a limit of a sequence that actually exists and you have a limit of well let's suppose that sequences inside a continuous function you can actually pull that function out do the limit first which also means that if this limit exists which is kind of cool all you have to do look at all you got to do is find the limit plug it into the function done let me give you a couple examples of this this real fast cuz I do not want to leave you hanging on this stuff and then uh we'll be done for today true or false the function e is a continuous function true or false true e is always continuous from negative Infinity to Infinity it just does it's always continuous because it it's continuous so e to X is continuous let's talk about the limit of s of 1/ n as n approaches Infinity please be careful and don't rush off to something silly with S I know that s does this I know it does that okay but look at what's going in what look at the argument of sign all right check this out as n approaches Infinity what's one/ n approach zero what's sign of zero do you did you guys get the idea here n is infinity therefore one over n as n approach Infinity is zero this is approaching zero what's sign as sign approaches zero zero zero hey does the limit exist exists in fact it's convergent here's the cool part here's where the theorem comes in okay check it out it says uh the function is continuous and the limit exists the function is continuous and the limit exists agreed that means that from here we could actually do e to the limit of sin 1 n as n approach to infinity or basically think about this look at look at the board here real quick Z this limit is zero right therefore we would just have to plug this into the function e to the0 how much is e to the Z One isn't that kind of isn't that rad kind of cool okay last one and then I'll let you go promise oh you're right do it good if you must go go uh I got to do this one because we're right here so if you got to go go you're not gonna offend me um but this is g to take us about maybe two minutes so first thing is tan inverse of X continuous yes no yes yes it is 10 inverse like this it is continuous can you find the limit of n^2 as n approaches Infinity okay this part is yes but what is it it's not a true question what is it inity okay so it exists it's not convergent but it does exist so this is continuous this exists here's what this says if I want to find the limit of tan inverse of n^2 as n approaches Infinity then all I got to do is find tan inverse of the limit and n approaches Infinity of n^2 now check it out okay watch careful this is the only only way I do okay tan inverse is continuous agreed that means that if I take a limit of it I can pull that limit out in front sorry take pull that tangent inverse outside of my limit so it says this is continuous this exists yes it's Infinity so let's pull that tan inverse up front what's the limit of n squ as n approaches Infinity again so what's tan inverse it's not a good math to write this but what's tan inverse of infinity what happens as we go towards Infinity what's what's this going to two that's right High over two okay is that interesting or what wow did that make sense to you so P feel okay with what we talked about today good deal all right so the last little bit of our section here on sequences uh the last little bit of our section on sequences talks about one specific type of sequence it's called a monotonic sequence and what monotonic means is a sequence and as far as a sequence goes is a sequence that is always increasing or always decreasing so monotonic means you start with a one term of your sequence and it either goes higher and higher and higher and higher every single time or it goes lower and lower and lower and lower every single time either grows forever or declines forever does that make sense to you that's what monotonic means the definition of it so a monotonic sequence is a sequence that is always increasing or decreasing a sequence that is always either increasing or is always decreasing what would mean as far as uh always increasing or always decreasing in terms of our sequence it would mean this if if a sequence is increasing then if I have a sub one and I have a sub 2 and I have a sub3 and I have so on and so forth well if it's always increasing then a sub 1 has to be less than a sub 2 and a sub2 has to be less than a sub3 and a sub3 has to be less than forever and ever and ever a sub4 forever never never never that would be the idea of increasing it start off and then the the terms get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger forever and ever and ever does that make sense to you okay decreasing of course would be the other way to say well you're starting off with some terms here but if you're decreasing then the first term would be bigger than the second term which would be bigger than the third term bigger than the fourth term forever and ever and that's a definition of the monotonic sequence it's a sequence that where the terms either grow or decrease increase or decrease forever and ever and ever should fans be okay with the idea of a monary sequence very good now what's going to be important for us is the act of showing whether a sequence is either always increasing or always decreasing we got to prove it because what we're going to be doing in just a minute here's like the advanced organizer what we're doing we're going to talk about monotonic sequences we're going to talk about whether or not they are bounded or uh sorry whether they're bounded or not um if we have a monotic sequence that is is bounded we can say certain things about that but in order to say that it's monotonic we've got to show that that sequence is always increasing or is always decreasing does that make sense we got to prove this or we got to prove this I'm going to give you a couple examples on how to do that then we'll talk about convergence as it relates to monotonic sequences I just said a whole bunch of words did you were you following all that stuff so number one thing we got to do uh for monotonic sequences is show that they are increasing or decreasing for instance and I'm going to give you two methods on how to do this two pretty good methods so right now I want to show that this sequence is increasing if you were to get this on your own and you well wait a minute I don't know whether n / n +1 is always increasing or always decreasing you might have to plug in a couple terms and figure out what's going on so I'd plug in like I don't know one and I'd plug in two 3 four five and see what's going on here is this increasing is this decreasing turns out that these are these fractions are getting bigger and bigger and bigger they are they're increasing here does that make sense to you okay so if we want to show this is always increasing there's basically two ways to do this one way to do this would be to consider start with the nth term and if we want to show that this is increasing listen carefully to this because this can throw some people if they're you're really not with it right now okay if you're trying to show increasing your first term or your nth term should be less than you could you could be less than or equal to uh less than or equal to your net next term now here's the question how would I get my next term n n plus one so for instance if this was my third term I'd have three and three correct that would be less than my fourth term which would be four and four that would be 3 + 1 if I had my 11th term it would be 11 and 11 that would be less than my 12th term be 11 + 1 11 plus so basically anytime you're trying to do this compare it to your next term your next term is just well whatever you had because we're dealing with whole number integers add one that would be your next term over what would this be okay n + 1+ 1 I heard that n + 1 + 1 now of course we're going to make that a little bit simpler aren't we sure n plus two I show hands you feel okay with that as our next term so let's think about it here's our nth term we got to be General right we can't plug in just one and plug in two because that would show that it's increasing only for one set of terms between a sub 1 and a sub 2 that doesn't make sense we got to show that this is increasing for all of our terms so for our nth term is it still increasing from n to n + one so we say okay here's our nth term it's just our sequence the next term would be add one to the end well that's going to be the next number past whatever you would say if you give me four I give you five you give me 11 I give you 12 I'm just adding one to whatever you're doing and that gives us our next term n okay to n+1 and + 1 2 n+ 1 + 1 or n plus 2 and if we're trying to show that it's increasing this term should be bigger or smaller than this term bigger should be bigger than this term now if we simplify it just a little bit we've got this so basically we're trying to prove that this is true now here's some things that we can do with it if we're simply trying to prove that this is true we can manipulate these two sides to to make it mean something a little different or make it mean uh make it look a little bit nicer for us I should say something that's easy to identify what's happening because right now like well I don't know is it obvious that this is bigger than this not really not super obvious because I'm adding one to this but I'm adding one of that I I don't know so maybe we do things like um let's multiply both sides by n plus 2 let's multiply both sides by n plus one essentially we're going to take this and put it here and take this and put it there is that legal to do okay you have to be careful it's legal to do with inequalities here only because this is what type of a number positive or negative if you multiply both sides by a negative do you remember that you flip your equalities okay now think about what n is when we defined n n is positive correct n plus one would be positive n plus two would be positive so by multiplying by n plus2 we don't have to worry about inequality because we're multiplying by a positive number does that make sense to you multiplying by n plus one we don't have to worry about our inequality because we're multiplying by a positive number so if I multiply both sides by n + 2 and n + 1 respectively I get n * n + 2 is less than or equal to n + 1 * n + 1 if I multiplied by negatives I'd have to flip my equality because I'm multiplying by positives I don't have to do that show you Lo okay with this so far now this is this is a little bit better but let's go ahead and distribute and really see what's going on if we distribute we get n^2 + 2 N we get less than n^2 + 2 n + 1 it's bigger do you know that this is bigger than this side yes is it true for all n bigger than one yes so since since this this is this is kind of cool this is true for all n greater than or equal to one the reason why this comes about is because hey um where do our sequences typically start and they go forever right so we don't really care about zero we don't really care about negatives I don't care about that stuff I care about positive numbers starting at one because that's where our sequences start so if I can show this for are you listening right now if I can show this for one and more then we're good to go make sense so if this is true well this came from this guy this came from this guy so because we manipulated this we didn't change around inequality we did all valid work with our inequalities here it says because this side is bigger than this side it says this side is bigger than this side and that right there shows that we are increasing for every n that's greater than or equal to one and that's all that counts because with our sequences we start with n greater than or equal to one and they're always positive show P feel okay with this so far so what we' just shown here we've shown that this is increasing this proves that this sequence is always increasing we were General we had NS we didn't use specific numbers we're good to go you sure you're okay with that okay would you like a different way to do it yes so this true for all this that means that this is increasing sometimes not all the time but sometimes we can use a very interesting idea to show increasing or decreasing here's another way to think about it so or I'll make a little caveat box four what if we had a different thought what if we said you know what I don't want to think of this like a sequence in fact if I just think of this not as a sequence but pretend that it is a function of X so basically instead of having n plus sorry n / n + one I think about a function of X XX + 1 where I've got a function in terms of x got a function terms of X here's the interesting thought but firstly does this look something like that to you now you need to understand something this is not this this is a function in fact it's a continuous function everywhere besides xal -1 understood it's continuous for one and more actually which is kind of cool uh this is not a continuous function this these are just fractions these this is a list of fractions that's all that this is so what we're doing here is we're we're kind of we're kind of making this thing into a function to to find out whether it's in increasing or decreasing using this one idea back in your Calculus one class could you tell me when a function was increasing and when a function was decreasing and what did you use to do that derivatives and use specifically the the slope which is what what is the slope of a function in terms of calculus instantaneous rate change okay spec you're you're right it's inst instantaneous rate of change how do we find the slope or instantaneous rate of change it's the first derivative in fact when you did uh it was one specific chapter for us it was chapter 3 it's called the first derivative test remember the first derivative test where you take the first derivative and you you and for us we would set it equal to zero and that would say where you're changing from increasing to decreasing and you pluged in two numbers it was positive if your first derivative was positive that meant your function was increasing do you remember doing that your first Der was negative your function was decreasing for that specific interval and that was nice we're going to use the same idea here if the first derivative gives us the rate of change if the first derivative gives us increasing or decreasing then we can use the first derivative here and here's how we do it if we did the first derivative now you got to know how to take the first derivative this is not a lall thing okay this is a this is a derivative now we haven't done this in a long time how would you do the derivative of x x + low D High minus high D L Square the bottom and away we are done I got mess that up not and away we go uh so low D High minus high D low Square the bottom away we go now of course I'm going to do this kind of quick right because we're supposed to be really good at at derivatives at this point the first derivative therefore would be 1 /x + 1 2 so F you okay with with that one now you need to understand something about this a first derivative is a slope it is a rate of change is a formula for the slope or the formula for the rate of change so basically if the first derivative is positive it means that our function is increasing if our first derivative is negative it means our function is decreased are you all with me on this yeah here's my question look at this is this positive or negative or both both you plug in any number in the freaking world and tell me if it's positive or negative is it always positive forever for anything now we don't care about forever or anything be real careful here we care that this is greater than zero or less than zero for X what X's do we care about do we care about negative X's right now no do we care about what is zero We Care X is greater than or equal to what to one now here's why this works for us just so you know we're we're taking this thing this sequence and calling it a function we're sfy the first derivative of the function if the first derivative of the function is positive it means the function is increasing if the first derivative of the function is negative it means the function is decreasing now we're saying xal 1 because really our sequence is going to start at one now we're going above and beyond here when you think about it this thing is not a sequence correct so I can plug in one and 1.1 and 1.3 and 1.5 and all these numbers in between 1 and two so we're basically going above and beyond what a sequence does let me make the point here for you if this works for all X's for X greater than equal to 1 it's certainly going to work for x = 1 and 2 and 3 and four and 5 and six and seven for when our n equals our X does that make sense or when our x equals our n for all the whole number integers show F if you see the the comparison here okay good so we're using the function to say hey if it works for everything it's certainly going to be increasing for all the positive integers and that's what our sequence does as well so we use the function to kind of cheat at the sequence and say hey if that's increasing that's certainly got to be you just can't call it an N because we're we're talking about a function here not a sequence so far so good okay so all last last time so for X greater than equal to one this is always true it's actually true anywhere but I don't have to have it anywhere I just have to have it for X greater than equal to one because that's where our sequence starts so since this is greater than zero this shows increasing as well so there's really two ways to do it you can consider a term and the next term and see what's going on you can consider a derivative of some function that's B based on your sequence and look at what's happening have I explained this well enough for you to understand it yes oh okay would you like to try another example yes please so now on this example I asked you to show that that's increasing I kind of gave you a heads up and said uh tell you what this thing is going to be increasing you just need to show it well that that kind of gave us a clue as to what to do here didn't it they said you certainly you're going to have determine the next term you have to have it anyway but we were looking for this we we manipulated it to see that that relationship uh this one well we could have done that either way couldn't we if we just found the first derivative it would have shown up that that's positive would have shown up that hey if your first derivative is positive your function is increasing if your function is increasing the sequence upon which that function is based must also be increasing for that interval well that means that if I give give you a function or a sequence I'm sorry if I give you a sequence and say just tell me whether this is increasing or not whether it's increasing or decreasing we might not want to start with this we might want to start with the derivative because that'll give us the answer typically every time now we can't always do a derivative I'll show you some examples where we can okay but if you can might be a nice way to start this so why don't you try firstly to call this a function in terms of X again um we're using a function in terms of X and not in terms of n because n stands for our sequence it's the terms where n is based on one and two and three and four we're saying a function of X saying now this is going to be hopefully a continuous function for one and more we're looking for a continuous function here if that's the case if our function is continuous and our function uh is always increasing or decreasing then our sequence is so as well but we can't call it in terms of n it's not the same thing so we are making a function in terms of X just basing it on the sequence what a function in terms of X look like can you tell me okay very good now what's the next idea what are you going to do say louder so I can hear you why are you going to take the derivative increasing or decreasing yeah a derivative gives you slope positive slope means increasing negative slope means decreasing go ahead and do the derivative so quotient R my good quotient room a while uh low D High minus high D low Square to the bottom away we go don't just take a derivative of the numerator and der denominator that's lall's Rule and that's not what we're doing here Mr Rob is that what you did low D High minus high D Square the bottom and away we're done way we go did you get that yes well that's really hard to see what's going on so maybe we start factoring and simplifying a little bit if we simplify this we can factor out the E to X can you simplify the e to the X's this is gone the two is gone remember that uh e to x^2 is e to 2x that's where that's coming from so this is the same thing as 1 - x over e to X now we need to think about what is happening for the required domain of our function the domain of our function is X is what greater than or equal to one yes no yes greater than or equal to one why is it Greater why why do I have it defined as X is greater than or equal to one are positive because our NS start where and they go higher 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 N9 that's why this is defined that way I'm trying to Define my my function as starting with my sequence because if this is increasing or decreasing for this entire domain the sequence is increasing or decreasing for every single n because all NS would fit somewhere in this domain make sense so let's think about it um what's e x is that positive negative or what if I now keep in mind if I'm plugging in one 2 3 4 5 6 7 is that positive or negative posi that's always positive so no matter what I plug in that's positive correct now think about this one 1 - x where X is 1 and more it's zero for the for one but then after that what is it then after that what is it after that what is it is it always negative so this is always less than or potentially equal to zero for X is greater than equal to one oh goodness that's so cool what's that tell you about this function is it increasing or decreasing for all X greater than one yes yes makes sense hopefully it makes sense I'm teaching it shoot come on now so if this is always negative for X great equal to 1 then that function is always decreasing for X than equal to one so that sequence is always decreasing for n is greater than equal to one you see the jump we just shown that function is decreasing all the time now here's the whole what we're trying to get to have I made this made sense to you any questions about this side here's what we're trying to get to being monotonic is awesome I guess I'm always on the upshot so I'm monotonically Inc whatever sucks to be a monic decreasing what a loser but anyway uh what we're trying to get is we're going to put two ideas together this idea of being monotonic and this next idea of being bounded a bounded sequence for some sequence if a subn is always less than some number if a subn is always greater than some number if a subn is always between number two numbers what bounded means bounded means this idea that the sequence is contained somewhere the sequence never goes above a certain number the sequence never goes below a certain number or the sequence is between two numbers forever does that make sense to you that's what bounded means so here's what we say um tell you what if every term of our sequence is less than seven or 10 or -4 or whatever it happens to be if every term in our sequence is less than a certain number one final fixed number we say that sequence is bounded above why because it's got ceiling you guys you guys get get what I'm saying here it's got a ceiling there the ceiling is M this should be bounded above now let's say that our sequence I'm using uppercase M and lowercase M just so you know I I write in all caps so it's really hard for me but that's supposed to be lowercase M so if our every term of our sequence is always bigger than a certain number every term is always bigger than one or bigger than3 or bigger than zero maybe it's got a floor it never drops below a certain amount it's got a floor it's bounded below does that make sense to you yes now what if both things happen What If look at this every term of our sequence is never smaller than this but never bigger than this so basically it's bounded above it never raises above M it's bounded below never goes below Little M we just say it's bounded this would be a bounded sequence sandwiched yeah that's right it's got a ceiling and it's got a floor it's like us right now if I jump I'm going to hit the SC W my hands I can't jump that high I I can jump but uh I'm not going to go below the floor right anyway um I probably could get my head on that ceiling may run a little bit little Run start get a concussion that make all time uh views on all time views on YouTube that will get you views teacher gets concussion teaching calculus too all over Facebook goodness not going to do that so anyway we got this idea if our sequence is always less than certain numbers bounded above if our sequence is always greater than a certain number it's bounded below if our sequence is between two numbers so basically if it's bounded above and it's bound below it's bounded that's the idea feel okay with that one now here's the whole thing we're going to put these two ideas together let's suppose that we have a monotonic sequence this is going to be so logic I hope it's logical let's say we have a monotonic sequence and we know it's bounded it's monotonic that means what that it's either increasing or decreas always going up or always going down and we know it's bounded always going up or always going down and it's bounded tell me what's going to happen it's approaching a limit if it's approaching a li well we say the limit exists it's approaching the limit exists as we're approaching Infinity tell me something about the sequence it's not mono decreasing or increasing yes it is it is it's just Bing it'll stop at some point no it won't stop what it's convergent I'll see you should have been louder I want you to consider what would happen okay look at look at this here's my bound above here's my bound below my upper bound my lower bound are you guys with me on this let's suppose that our sequence is bounded please please watch up here while I'm doing this okay suppose your sequence is bounded then your sequence is between here correct yeah this is not a monoton this is a piece of crap that's not nothing that's doing nothing for us but suppose that your sequence is monotonically increasing or decreasing I don't care what it is if it's increasing I can start whatever want as long as it's in here right it's going to be increasing can I do oh no no shoot ah it's increasing but it's bounded but still increasing it's still bounded it's still it's still increasing is it going to a certain numberin what number it's going to it's going to the Limit as n approaches Infinity would be Big M does that make sense to you actually we don't even care about this one because it's monotonically increasing doesn't even matter that it has a lower bound here so every I I'll say a couple things every monotonically increasing sequence that's bounded above is going to converge every monotonically decreasing sequence that's bounded below is going to converge does that make sense to you that's why this is here if it's bounded well if you're monotonically listen if you're monotonically decreasing if you're monotonically decreasing you're going to be bound above at some point at some point because you you're decreasing all the time right it's never going to come back up so you can say it's fixed at that number not not an issue start with your first term that's your that's your bound above what we care about for decreasing is a lower bound don't we because we need we need to have a floor we need to have this the the planes falling right it's going to hit the ground eventually it's bounded below it can't keep going into the ground it's going to cause a crater a little bit that's horrible thought you evil people what are you doing putting thoughts in my mind but it's it's going to be bound below at some point if it's going to if it's going to land it's going to be bound below it's going to eventually get to one level that's what this is saying if we have a monotonically decreasing sequence and we don't have this bound we can't say anything about it it's going to keep on going down we don't know but as soon as we say it's bounded below as soon we say that sequence is bounded then we know it's going to be convergent as soon as we say we have an increasing sequence and we say it's bounded above of course this is terms right as soon as you know it's increasing if there was no bound we couldn't say anything about it but as soon you say hey it's monotonically increasing and there's an upper bound it has to go to that number Big M show if that makes sense to you that's all I'm trying to say here so that's the idea behind putting this together let me give you just one example to illustrate this and uh talk about one more small idea and then we'll call it good for this section show that that sequence is convergent oh my gosh how in the world going show that that that is convergent let's consider our sequence our sequence is 2 to the N given by the given by term by term 2 N Over N factorial so far so good mhm the first thing you might want to consider is whether this thing is yeah whether it's increased do you know whether it's increasing or decreasing I don't know either well you might want to plug in some numbers huh and find out whether it's increasing or decreasing um might not want to just start taking a limit arbitrarily so maybe find out whether it's it's going to fit this whether it's increasing or decreasing whether it's bounded above whether it's bound below let's deal with the increasing or decreasing first so let's talk about that uh 2 the N Over N Factor maybe we come up the first like five six terms and figure out what's going on with this so we do first term would be 2 over 1 yes mhm next term would be 2 to the 2 over two okay well look at that is that increasing or decreasing same neither that's why for monotonically decreasing we had the idea of less than or equal to okay so it can be equal to it for a while but it's got to start going down eventually does that make sense okay let's do let's do this is one this is two this was three what is it 8 over 6 oh something's happening this would be 16 [Music] over 24 24 yeah I fell asleep a little bit be 32 over 120 oh what's happening uh is this increasing or decreasing we're going to look to try to show that this is decreasing so if you don't know I don't know I don't know what that was you got to look at it I did because I did the problem before H uh but you'd have to think about it what's what's happening here this is staying the same and then it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller and way smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller so this thing right here says is this is decreasing however does this prove that it's decreasing forever we have not proved it we've done the first five terms so we have this idea that we think it's decreasing so it's decreasing I don't know we're going to think about it we're going to see if it's decreasing now you got to show it so here's what we're trying to show I'm I'm going to change this around just a little bit so remember what decreasing means decreasing means that a subn is greater than or equal to a subn + one that's what it means it means that as we go turn by term we're getting smaller and smaller are you okay with a subn + 1 yes this means the next term so we have hey term number one this would be term two term number seven this be term eight term number 100 this would be 101 does that make sense to you the next term should be smaller now I'm going to flip this around because I I want to show you a certain way so I'm going to flip this around another way you can think about it is that your next term should be less than or equal to your first term it's just a little backwards do these things say the same thing to you yes Okay the reason why I'm doing this is because you can show this one of two ways you can straight up just show it like we did one example or you can use a ratio approach watch this if I divide both sides by a subn I would get a subn + 1 over a subn is less than or equal to if you can show that if you can show that you show monotonically decreasing if you can show this you show monoton does that make sense to you monotonically decreasing means this that's what it means this is the same thing as this this is the same thing as this provided one thing happens tell me something about a subn for this to be true it can't be not I don't care about zero it can't be negative can't be negative a subn would have to be positive otherwise your inequality would flip because you'd be dividing by negative does that make sense to you so this will work if a and is positive if a subn is positive so shall we try I'm going to start from from right here so I'm going to do uh I'm going do this one so basically we're going to work a little bit little bit backwards we start with let's start with the nth term right now what we know is the nth term is this guy it's 2 the N Over N factorial you guys okay with that so far to the N or that's our nth term the next term someone on the right hand side you guys tell me what the next term would be how would you find the next term 2 okay hang on 2 n + 1 2 N okay two to two to the that bro two to the power perfect that's exactly right so look at if our if our first term is 2 the N our next term is 2 the n + 1 because we're dealing with positive integers here we're just adding one to it does that make sense to you so if our nth term goes 2 the N our next term is starts out with 2 to the n + 1 so far so good what's the denominator going to Beal perfect D how we show that is with those parentheses and then factori quick show hands you feel okay with that so far so this is the a subn term this is the a subn + one term so far so good if we're going to try to show what we thought if we're going to try to show decreasing so the reason why we did the the first few terms we go well I don't know what this thing's doing let's find the first few terms the first few terms make it look like it's decreasing right that idea says okay if you're going to show decreasing this has to be true if you're going to show decreasing this has to be true if you're going to show decreasing this has to be true provided that's positive so if we're going to show decreasing this has to be true let's make the jump stick with me if it's going to be monotonically decreasing do you understand that this has to be true yes your second term must be less than your first term that's decreasing your second term must be less than or equal to your first term your next term must be less than or equal to your previous term that's all we're saying right here show F you okay with that so far now what's kind of nice about this is that we can use the division of fractions as a complex fraction to solve this thing pretty nicely pretty easily so check it out is this always positive yes two then is positive yeah MH is this always positive yes for sure so let's use this idea let's say okay well now that we know that this is true if we divide both sides by our a subn we get 2 to the n + 1/ n + 1 factorial all over 2 the N of n factorial is less than or equal to 1 now that looks nasty but we're going to see a lot of this sort of stuff let's keep going with it first show hands you feel okay getting from actually getting from here to Here show hands you feel okay with that that's good that's everybody that's fantastic now what do you do when you have a fraction divided by a fraction multip reci you reciprocate this and you multiply so this becomes n factorial over 2 to the n so far so good yes no I'm going to kind of move a little bit quick on this stuff so stick with me here folks now think about what this means what this is I hope you guys are with if you get this you're going to get the whole thing do you know that 2 the n + 1 is the same thing as 2 n * 2 because this would be to the first Power you add exponents when you multiply common bases this is n factorial no this is 2 to the N no big deal with there here's less than or equal to 1 now here's the cool part I want you to think about n + 1 factorial n + 1 factorial would look like this please watch carefully it'd be n + 1 time n time n -1 * N - 2 * forever until you get to one does that make sense to you this is n +1 factorial that's what that is is that clear for you you start with 11 then you do 10 976 here's the cool thing about this if this is n n +1 factorial what's this n factorial it's n factorial therefore here's a little side note for you keep this in the back of your mind all the time n +1 factorial is the same thing as n +1 times n factorial does that not make sense to you it does hopefully it makes sense to you n factorial * n +1 is n +1 factorial this says hey you taking n +1 * 1 less than that n times all the stuff before n that's n +1 * n factorial you guys okay with that one well here's what's nice about that then this thing is n + 1 * n factorial do you think see anything that's going to simplify for us do you see why we do you see why we did that what what simplifies factorial bam gone by the way do you do you understand why we didn't just do a derivative here do you know how to do derivative n factorial no okay how about this one two what do we get 2 question you need to now say whether this is true or F false for n greater than equal to 1 is this true yes for n greater than or equal to 1 yeah plug in one what do you get you get one that's true statement plug in two three and four and five and anything bigger than one is this always going to be less than one yes then this is true for n bigger than or equal to 1 therefore we've shown that this is always decreasing we start we started with decreasing didn't we look at look at the board please we started with decreasing right hello right yes start with decreasing we showed that our work is all valid this is always true for n bigger than equal to one so therefore this sequence is always decreasing for n greater than equal to one if it's always decreasing that's monotonically decreasing you guys okay with that so far now let's consider what's going on here so 2 n/ N factorial is number one monotonically decreasing number two I want you to think of 2 the n/ n + 1 factori sorry Over N factorial tell me something about 2 N Over N factorial tell me something think about what its smallest value could possibly be could it be negative no okay so right there you got it if it can't be negative what's the smallest value you could possibly attain or get close to zero that means it's bounded below by zero does that make sense to you it's got to be you answer the question yourself if it can't be negative then this must be bounded below by zero this is because a subn is always positive now I'm going to make a little caveat here this is bounded above by something okay it's probably bounded above by where we start so are you with me if you plug in one what get when we plugged in one uh we got it two or something we got two so the upper bound is two now do I care about the upper bound right now this function is always decreasing sorry the sequence is always decreasing always decreasing I care that it's decreasing do I care about the ceiling no do I care about the floor yeah so I care that it's decreasing and bounding below I would care that it would be increasing and bound it above it's not increasing though it's decreasing is it decreasing and does it have a lower bound then what do you know about the sequence every bounded monotonic sequence is is this bounded yes is it monotonic yes don't care whether it's monotonic increasing or decreasing if it's bounded appropriately this is decreasing bound below therefore this is convergent bam now you know if that made sense to you you sure yes do you get the idea what increasing is what monotonically decreasing is do you understand that if it's increasing and bound it above it's going to converge don't pack up yet I have one one more minute to uh to do stuff I'm going to do it too it's going to take one minute so do you understand that it's bounded above and it's increasing it's going to converge if it's bound below it's decreasing it's going to converge so basically and basically if it's if it's monotonically increasing there will be a lower bound as well that's why they use that word bounded so it's bounded increasing no problem bounded decreasing no problem that's the case we have here the last little bit is just a little statement um it's a very kind of obvious statement I want to give it to you before we end because it'll help you on some of this some of this stuff little note I want you to think of a number to a power of n so like you give me a number give me a give me a number one what say what one one okay one or eight or 1/3 and I say okay now take that number and take it to the first Power then the second power then the third power then the fourth power then the fifth power and six power and seventh power and every positive integer forever okay I want you to look at what those numbers are doing when are the numbers going to converge when are the numbers going to diverge you said one if you give me the number one it's going to be one forever isn't it that would converge if you give me the number negative 1 it would be 1 negative 1 1 negative 1 one or actually netive 1 onega 1 1ga 1 onega 1 forever would that converge or diverge if you give me eight give me eight 8 to the 1st 8 to the second 8 to the 3D a to the 4th what's happening monotonically increasing without bound well that's the whole thing right it's got to be bounded that would diverge how about one half one2 would be decreasing it would also be positive that would be bounded below mon the decreasing and bounded below by zero that would converge you guys with me about negative one2 no no negative2 okay this is going to be weird but2 to the N same thing as1 to the n time 12 to the N yes no remember that whole idea that if the absolute value of the sequence converges sequence converges do you remember the whole idea about if the absolute value of the sequence converges then the sequence converges boah converges okay so here's the point there's two numbers that are kind of our guidelines one and 1 anything between oh do you understand that anything between there is going to get smaller fractions take fraction to a power what happens I don't care that it's negative it's going to go positive negative positive it's going remember that whole thing it's going to do this remember that yeah it's going to do that if it's negative if it's positive it just does that if it's a fraction that's what that says the reason why the negative 1 is not included is because the negative 1 we already did negative 1 to the N goes negative 1 1ga 1 1 1 one it never gets any closer one's there because it's always going to be one does that make sense to you okay uh so also last thing you can already tell what this is if the limits going to exist what's it going to be zero it's either going to be zero or one yeah if it's monotonically decreasing or it's the absolute value is is going to tend towards one number it's going to be zero for R is not equal to one you know I'll say it this way for R between those two numbers it would equal one if R equals 1 that's the only two options you got this is either going to go to zero or it's going to go to one if this is one naturally it's going to be one to the whatever power is going to be one if it's not one it's either going to diverge if it's outside this range or going to converge if it's inside that range have I made that make sense for you yeah okay question okay 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 9.2:  Series, Geometric Series, Harmonic Series, and Divergence Test
so now that we've just finished talking about sequences we're going to progress one little step and talk about series you see with sequences we just stff like this we said suppose we have a sequence of terms and it goes for a while and we looked basically at whether this thing with this sequence would converge or whether the sequence would diverge and we I I showed you in last section basically how to do that remember we taking a limit of it working with a limit maybe using the squeeze theorem sometimes doing the comparison tests with that well now we're progressing a little bit further if we have a sequence and we say well now I want to do something more than just look at the terms as being a list what if I wanted to actually add them together as soon as we take that sequence we go no no no I don't want to just list them out I want to add them what we get is called a series now there's a couple different ways that we're going to look at series the first first notation that I'm going to introduce to you and you've seen this before it's probably been a really long time since you have seen it Sigma yeah it's with that Sigma notation so when we use this Capital Greek letter Sigma uh Sigma s stands for a sum so whenever we see that we have a sum so we say here's okay suppose that we have remember that notation what would that stand for that would stand for if I did this would be a sequence no now it says Okay cool so I want you to take these terms of your sequence and I want you to add them together from where I tell you to start to where I tell you to end that right there would be a series are you guys okay with the notation of a series quicke not if you are okay with that so here's what this would do this would say okay here's terms of your sequence right boom boom boom boom boom so boom boom boom boom this says you add them together instead of just list them out it tells you where to start and it tells you where to stop where do we start one where do we stop we do not stop we keep on adding them and adding them and adding them and adding them now there is another way that we're going to consider this we can look often times as we're where we're going to work with a lot today for the next probably 30 minutes or so we can work with what's called a partial sum can look at what's called a partial sum I want you to consider the comparison of these two things firstly would this still be a series yes where would it start yeah would start at the first term when I plug in one for K notice how I'm using a different uh different index here I'm not using n I'm using k because where does this series stop that's right so here's what this would do if I say no I don't want to start at one and go to Infinity I want to start at one and go to 100 or a million or something finite well this would add up all those terms now here's the here's the point I'm trying to make here do you understand that n is going to be your stopping point so because n is finite here then what we're going to get is something that that for sure exists because this is a finite number of terms because we start at one we're going to add these things up we're going go hey what's the first term cool what's the second term cool what's the third term cool what's the nth term cool add them all up is that for sure going to be there yeah if I say hey um here's some series and add up the first 10 terms you can do it can't you first 100 terms you can do it can't you the first n terms you can do it can't you the first Infinity terms I don't know I don't know what that might be because that that goes forever right but as soon as I say you know what n's a finite n's a finite number here so because n is finite n is finite that's a finite number of terms this has to be some sum so let me go over that here real quick because I'm going to I'm going to use this information just a bit so we have this thing called a series what a series did does it says hey you know what it's no longer just a sequence it's no longer just a list of terms now we're going to add those terms together that's what this stands for generally speaking this is what we're trying to do here folks we're trying to start at our first term and add up all the terms for Infinity this is what we're trying to do now because I can't just add things forever cuz I'm not going to live forever uh probably you never know uh but because I'm not going to live forever I can't add them forever so what I'm going to do is I'm going to try to work around this idea I'm going say you know what wait a minute let's not go forever let's go to a finite number now because I'm starting at the number one for my terms here so the first term and because I'm stopping after some finite amount I'm going to able to add those terms together does that make sense to you this sum has to exist because n finite subn your sum your partial sum this is called a partial sum here your partial sum must exist show fanty if you understand that concept okay now here's the important part about this you understand this finite right this can be a number like 10 or 100 or 200 do you understand that for every additional n so if I go from 1 to 10 that's going to be a number right if I go from 1 to 11 that's going to be a different number if I go from 1 to 12 that's going to be a different number 1 to 100 that's going be a different number do you guys get the idea well then what's going to happen little subnote here for I'll call it the next n for the next n so the one right after this one remember these are U by the way just so you don't lose track of what we're doing here that n that still has to be positive it still starts at one and and it's still just your inte it can start at zero sometimes but it's just your integers all right so it's not like uh any real number they are positive integers here you with me just like on sequences we're basically just taking a sequence and adding up the terms okie dokie so for the next end that means hey stop at 10 now I want you stop at 11 now I want you stop at 12 so for the next n we're going to get a new sub subn we're going to get a new sum here's the interesting thing I'll try to put it all together for you all right put it all together sequence if I don't add them series if I do add them this is the way we write series what we're trying to do is figure out this sum the sum of this series now the way we're going to do it we're going to look at a partial sum we're going to say cool cool let's go from one to a finite number because we're going from one to a finite number this sum has to exist now for every next n that I get I'm going to get a different partial sum does that make sense if I get a different partial sum then check this out this is pretty cool if I just go from one to one I'm going to have partial sum one to two partial sum 1 to three partial sum 1 to four partial sum one to five partial sum so for every additional N I get a new SMN this creates a sequence of partial sums do you get that idea that's kind of cool right that's weird that's why we cover sequences this creates a sequence of partial sums well let's think about the sequence of partial sums this is so nice the notation works for us if I go from one to if I stop at one look at that n would be one n would be one I would get s 1 if I stop at two I would get S Sub 2 if I stop at three I would get a sum of the first three terms if I stop at four I would get a sum of the first four terms and so on and so on until I get to wherever you tell me to stop I will get that many different terms does that make sense to you this is our sequence of partial partial sums now here's the main notes for us we'll get into some examples in just a minute uh this is all like the the theory behind it our our base okay this is our foundation so here's some notes for us why we did sequences is for the next couple statements that we're going to make you see because I'm going to a finite n yeah that's got to exist but because every n would give me a different sum that creates a sequence for me the first sum the second sum the third sum the fourth sum the fifth sum the nth sum well because that's a sequence here's a couple things we know what we know is that if the sequence of s subn converges if we know the sequence of sub subn converges then the limit of sub subn will have to exist so this by definition our limit of s subn would equal let's call it s as n goes to Infinity well then this is what this is going to show for us I'm going to I'm going to show you the the notation here in just a minute but if your sequence converges check this out this is pretty cool if your sequence converges that means that this sequence is going to one specific number correct that's what conversion means in fact that's what this means right it says hey look at that your sequence as n goes to Infinity is giving you a a specific number does that make sense to you your sequence is going into one number that's what what was our Definition of convergence here well what are the s's what is s subn it's a sum it's actually a sum of whatever this thing is right now now stick with me here this is where we make the the jump the like calculus jump because this uses limits Okay so do you guys understand that our s subn or S Sub one that's a sum s sub2 is a sum and sub3 is a sum and S subn is a sum now check this out if your sequence converges the limit of your sequence as n approaches Infinity would exist that means that your s subn term as n approaches Infinity is going to be there that means your sum as n approaches Infinity will exist if your sequence of partial terms is convergent if that converges what that means is is that if this happens okay one more time s subn is a sum right if this happens you know where the sum is that's the idea does that make sense to you because this says hey you know what uh stop at 10 stop at 12 you're going to get sums aren't you now don't stop well you got to look at your sequence if your sequence converges you go okay cool go to Infinity your sequence is there that sequence converges that sum exists that's the sum of your series that's the idea you just keep on extending it one term at a time one term at a time until you get to infinity and then if your sequence converges that means that that the uh the limit of your sequence gives you that one number that one number is your Su let me write some of this notation out we'll go over one more time I'm still getting some glossy looks from you kind of glossed you over there let me show you some notation I'm guessing it's going to make some more sense okay so I'm going to throw a limit up on the board here real quick uh show you how this relates back to your limit of of your partial sums and then we'll hopefully get to it you guys ready let's start with this so we have a sum or a series of a subn from n 1 to Infinity here's the idea the the idea is dang I don't know what that's going to be so here's what we're going to do we're going to make this equivalent to a partial sum but the only way we can do that is do this this is the important part okay check it out so here's the idea you go okay uh let's consider this instead of going from 1 to Infinity let's change our index here let's go from K = 1 to n of a sub K here's my question to you let's see if you're having calcul if you have a calculus brain today all right here's your here's my question are these equal right now no why not you need to take so would be a finite number wouldn't it are do they start the same place yeah and these terms would be the same this would be based on K this would be based on N but no big deal you get the same numbers out of it all right however this one don't stop this one does stop doesn't it so how can I make this expression equal this expression how can I make this equal liit where would n goity perfect calculus brains you got calculus brains today that's good now these look the same to you yes this says hey you're going from one to n but now take n to Infinity that creates this for us well here's the cool thing about this we already have a definition for what this thing is this right here is your partial sum do you see it okay so stick with me here folks stick with me here's the jump here's another jump okay so because this a partial sum because we're going going to from one to a finite number yeah we're going to take the N to Infinity later okay this is what we're doing later because we're going from one to a finite number you said this thing has to exist remember saying that over here you said this thing has to exist all the stuff says that well then this equals s subn you guys with me on that one this part is s subn does that make sense now check this out we've already talked about this this is a sequence this is a sequence S Sub 1 s sub2 s sub3 all the way to s subn in fact we've talked about this if this sequence converges if this sequence converges this is going to go to a finite number s if that sequence doesn't converge then it doesn't go to a finite number s doesn't go to a specific number it goes to infinity or negative infinity or something alternating like we Hada 1 one something that where the limit does not exist however if this does exist that means that well let's let's read it back if the limit of our sequence s subn exists that means that the limit of our partial sums exists the limit of a partial sums is our series and that's what we we just made it down to so if feel okay with with this statement so basically it says all right uh got a series Infinity call it a partial sum that partial sum I don't care what it is this partial sum right here has to exist bam we already said if I take a limit this may or may not exist I don't know yet I don't know okay but if it does exist if it does it says here's what's going on you have a sequence of terms yes this is a sequence of terms those terms stand for partial sums they stand for the sum if I take the sum at Infinity that's what this stands for this is the sum at Infinity well if that converges that means it goes to a specific number that would be our sum of our series you guys with me I hope I explain it well enough for you to understand did I do that for you okay some people get all like oh my gosh how does this how is this a sequence why is it relating well it's related because you have a sequence of terms which are your partial sums because we can go to Infinity with a sequence we can go to Infinity with our partial sums we can go Infinity now with our series would you like to see an example example yes a simple example whatever tongue twister it was a tongue twister last thing just so we know this maybe it's an obvious statement to you if the sequence F subn diverges what's going to happen to our series typically what's going to happen if this diverges this goes to infinity or negative Infinity you add up to something that goes to infinity or negative infity sometimes you'll get the just diverges the limit does not exist therefore you can't do it example time do you have any questions on this whatsoever because I'm going to erase it we're not going to talk about anymore this is all the theory behind it we're just going to do examples now so do you get the idea of a series that terms being added together yes no yes do I get that we can find a a partial sum no matter what because when I take a limit of a partial sum it goes to my series therefore if my sequence of partial sums is convergent my series is convergent if the sequence of partial sums is Divergent then my series is Divergent that's basically it what's also very cool is that when I do my limit I actually get the sum which means I'm add I I've added up that series because that sum is going to Infinity hey sorry because the sequence of partial sums is going to Infinity when I get there that is my sum of my series cool it is cool I think it's cool it's very interesting to me time too I just wanted to make sure you see the interplay between the sequences and the series because some people are like well we did sequences now series are completely different well we're using sequences in our series here so example n goes from one to Infinity of n something very simple here's the idea of what you're supposed to do the first thing that we're supposed to do I wish I could have left this on the on the board but this is good enough the first thing we're supposed to do is we need to find a partial sum because ultimately here's what we're doing we're going to try to do this whole thing right typically what we'll show is we'll show this to a partial sum and if that partial the limit of the partial sum exists we're good to go so we got to find a partial sum now that is not as easy as I just made it seem uh sometimes they are very difficult to find in this case this one's going to be fairly straightforward but this is not always the case so s subn that's that's the def that's our our notation for a partial sum can you tell me what the partial sum would look like 2 okay so the partial sum says take this and then start adding up the the terms in there the terms adding up the terms of a sequence so the terms of our sequence would be one yeah and then two and then three and where would I stop very good I'd stop at n should P feel okay with that so far do you understand that I'm stopping because now it's a partial sum I'm going from one to N whever I stopped this is our partial sum here so S Sub n's yeah okay start at one go to n we've just done that now step number two this is where it gets difficult this is typically pretty easy you just plug in some numbers you go and then you ultimately plug in N no problem step number two is you got to find a formula for this that's the hard part oh sorry uh yeah find a formula for for for estim find a formula fortim so basically you need to do this what that equals what the formula for the partial sum is not just the terms and the sequence okay look at look look this is the formula for the terms in the sequence it's done okay it says that hey you want your 10th term in the sequence it's 10 hello you should plug in 10 that's easy what I want now is a formula for the partial sum a formula for this crap well does anybody know what the formula for that is n n close no we're Downs sliding oh you're closer with the first one uh you actually use these in your ran sums if you remember those I think it's it's story that gaus uh found this out when he was like in elementary school or something pretty cool was that genius uh he he's super smart was he's really now he's dumb right CU he's dead he can't do no more math maybe I don't know maybe wherever he's at wherever he's at so this is our our our formula for the partial sum s subn so what we know is that s subn is equal to n n + 1 / 2 you guys okay with that one so far okay so what we've done is all right here's our here's our series no problem it says series adding it up says start with a start with a list of your your terms of your Series so we're we're doing okay S Sub thenal sum would go from one plug in one two plug in two plug in three all the way till you plug in and you actually have to have that nth term in there do not just leave this hanging with your dot dot dot okay end it with your nth term do you got me yeah now it says okay cool find a formula this is the hard part so finding this formula is the hard part the rest of it's very easy so once we find a formula awesome here's what we've done we've just done this part we we have that now now it says I want you to determine what's going to happen as your end goes to Infinity so basically if the partial sum for every term that you want is given by this formula check it out if I said hey find the partial sum uh for the six for the first six terms you should have to plug in six it'd be 6 * 7 over 2 done you guys with me on that one well that that's awesome now it says find out what happens as n goes to Infinity so our step number three is really pretty straightforward step number three is just take a limit as n approaches Infinity what this does is this makes our partial sum equal to our series that's what that does check this is why I asked you this very first question I said all right now check it out are these two things equal are these two things equal right now with me covering this up no no they're not so this would not this would equ this but this would not equal that correct cuz these two things are the same so if these two things aren't equal the way I make them equal is I let this go to infinity and that's where our limit is so as soon as we find our F subn just take your limit as n approaches infinity and then if it converges awesome we found our sum if it of our series if it doesn't converge well then we can't find the sum of our series it's impossible to do that quick head now if you're okay with that fun right so step number number three says no problem just take a limit as n approaches Infinity of n n + 1/ 2 how much do that get to equal don't even worry about this about doing a lot of math on this how much is that going to equal that's going to be Infinity that's infinity plus one right that's Infinity what's infinity time Infinity definitely Infinity over two cares Infinity what's that tell you does the does the sequence here here's perfect terminology I hope that you're getting this is the sequence of partial sums convergent is the sequence remember these are partial sums right is this is a sequence of partial sums is a sequence of partial sums convergent no it's Divergent what that means that when you get to the infinite term the sum of that n equals infinity you're you're going to get positive Infinity here well then what's your sum it's Divergent we don't know because if our sequence of partial sums is Divergent that means our series is also Divergent so we'd say series all that work for nothing series is Divergent I know we got very little payoff with that one but I wanted to show you that not all series are Divergent but this is the way you go about it so ADV feel okay with with that one good good all right can we move on to another example do you have any questions at all on this one before we get going yes am I explain this well enough for it to make perfect sense to you of course first time for everything right all right so uh let's do more I'm going to try to give you a whole bunch of different types of examples here because a lot of these things are done different oop sorry I'm so used to X's um what should it be yeah for some reason I really like these type of series some people don't so much I do so what I'm going to try to do is I'm going to try to see whether this series is convergent and if it is I'm going to try to find the sum if it's not then we're good to go we're done so I'm going to try to find the sum of this series what's the first thing that I might want to do combine FR find the partial sum find the partial sum so I'm going to try to find the partial sum so the partial sum says okay well the first thing that you better do I'm I'm going to write a little bit smaller than I normally do because I'm going to need some space here first thing that we do is we well we list out some terms here so we we better list out some terms how do you find terms in a series what would you do yeah because what a series is is just a sequence added together so let's plug in one if I plug in one I'm going to get 1 see see where the one comes fromus one perfect this would be n = 1 that's our Nal 1 term you okay with that one what's the next thing I put nope before that oh plus a plus sign because it's a series okay so let's keep on going what's going to be our next two fractions can you tell me that 17 - 15 very good this would be n = two what's the next thing I do plus very good okay can you come with two more fractions here for me n - 17 1 nth - 1 7 very good I love patterns this is our third term show P you feel okay getting those those fractions so hey you know what you plug in one you got it you plug in two you got it you plug in three you got it now you need to do this until the nth term so basically yes you're looking for a pattern okay you're looking for for something you can make a formula out of we're going to skip a whole bunch of them and we're going to go to oh what do I want to do yeah I'll do that for you I'm going to go to ah shoot are you guys going to get super confused if I go down here and do dot dot dot and then plus down here no Okay so line just use your imagination I want the Nal nus 2 terms I want the N = nus1 terms and I want the n = n terms actually you know what by WR uh because it's a partial sum we could use we could use this we could use K really that's what it should be uh because our partial sums are K to n so if you really want to be mathematically prudent here you would do K and then we do oh okay cuz Nal nus 2 that doesn't really make a lot of sense we do K and we do K and we do k um are you okay with that one reasoning behind it is because s subn the the series from uh k equal 1 to n that was our S Sub n okay that gave us an actual sum here so so really when you're doing the partial sums you should have your letters in terms of K Are you seriously though no pun in 10 are you okay with that okay a okay a okay now the last one's I'm going to work backwards here the last one's really easy if I let these go to Just n I'm going to have 1/ 2 n + 3 - 1 2 N plus one do you see where that's that one's coming from mhm now if I have to find these guys this would be 1 over it wouldn't be 2 N - two bless you yes nus 1 + 3 very good - 1 over 2 N -1 + 1 notation getting sloppy there we go show fans if you understand that concept you feel okay with that one guys in the middle yes no are you sure so this says hey you're plugging in two plug in two plug in three plug in three plug in N minus one you're plugging in N minus one here it is nus one and N minus one that's all you're doing make sense now if I want n minus 2 it would be what one over what 2 - 2 - 1/ 2 N - 2 + 1 ladies and gentlemen are we all okay with that so far if you didn't simplify your fractions now's where you'd want to do it okay if you didn't simplify these things now is where you'd want to do it so I'm going to write these in purple uh this is going to be just my my my fractions that are simplified so we [Music] have one over 2 N that look at that if you if you distribute that and you combine some like terms how much are you going to get 2 n - one 2 nus one you with me are you with me yes this would be 1 over 2N do you see the minus three that one come on folks help me out here one distribute combin like terms one over 2 and what is itus one over please don't you give me 2 N on this minus one do you see where Theus one comes from you can't just subtract one add one you have to you com my terms now this one this is good to go we fine okay quick show hands you feel okay with this so far would you be able to do this on your own of course you would it's pluging in numbers this says plug in one plug in two plug in three you got the fractions this says plug in I go backwards on these ones all the time I plug in N N's easy man exactly what you got plug in N plug in N minus one plug in nus 2 and simp are there any questions on how we got those this is important that you understand how we got those do you understand how we got those are you sure yes okay so I'm not going to look here anymore I don't want to look there I'm going to look at these fractions I'm going to find out what in the world is happening here Charles you okay um the second one should that be on the bottom one n or 2 nus one for this an this yeah so -2 - 2 + 2 I think we're right I think we're good sorry no problem you okay with this now obviously we don't have every single term listed because we don't know what n is ultimately n is going to go to Infinity that's why we had to include the N you can't just say let's go to seven okay well no cuz the limit would't work there right well what's awesome about these types of telescoping series you should be writing that series is that a lot of times most of your terms they're gone check it out now when you're Crossing these out you need to follow the pattern please listen carefully what I'm saying follow the pattern it's crucial do you see anywhere else where you have a positive 1/5 and a minus 1/5 look at the relationship amongst the terms here's how I do it first fraction crosses with the last fraction and the next term so first fraction last fraction next term did you get that first fraction last fraction next term did you got that first fraction it would cross out with the last fraction in the next term gone well we've done the we've done the first one let's work backwards now okay let's go backwards here let's let's look at this um last term our last fraction crosses out with the first fraction in the previous term do you catch that one yes no okay well last fraction crosses out with the first fraction in the previous term that was the same pattern only in reverse first fraction cross out with last fraction next term first fraction crossed out with last fraction next term now here's the issue first fraction would cross out with the is this here no so this stays there's nothing there we stopped at N I don't need the N plus1 term we stopped right there does that make sense to you mhm now look at this one is this one going to cross out MH our last fractions remember this relationship last fractions crossed out with the first fraction term previous last fraction would have crossed out with the first fraction the term previous it would be gone here's the last one how about the negative 1/3 last terms cross out with the first fraction in the term previous is is there another fraction before this so then basically this is so awesome what are the only things that are going to be left in our partial sum 13 oh no it's not 1/3 13 and 1 2 3 do you understand that every other fraction in this problem is gone they all gone they gone they're all gone everything else gone well hey look at that right now we have a formula for our partial sums this was step number two we created a formula for our partial sums isn't that kind of nice if I say I want the partial sum after the 10th term here's what you do You' plug in 1/3 you plug in 10 done done that's it now the question becomes does this converge or does that diverge what do you have to show for that take the limit just take the limit this is now your formula so in Step number three we go all right well let's take a limit of our partial sums as n approaches Infinity that means that we'll take a limit of our partial sums as n approaches Infinity can you tell me ladies and gentlemen what's going to happen to my limit of this partial sum as n approaches Infinity no the whole thing zero what happens to this that's zero what happens to this here's the awesome part about this this goes back to the theory that we talked about the very beginning not the theory uh the work that we did basically your partial sums are going to eventually end at- 1/3 does that make sense and they don't really end but uh they converge to 1/3 well because this is equal to our Series right now we know the series is equal to 13 that is awesome let's it's very kind of interesting that when we add up all these terms forever we'd still get- 1/3 Jessica you had a question yeah could you explain how the 1 over 2 nus 3 got crossed out again 2 n- 3 yeah this one okay so did you notice how the 17th that's a last fraction right yeah it's Crossing out with a previous fraction like a previous term the 1/5 is crossing out with the previous term the this one would be Crossing out with a previous term just like this one did just like this one did okay now we don't go any FR than this that's our nth term so this one doesn't get to get crossed out this one doesn't because there's no previous term okay that's the idea we just pretend like we have a ter dot dot dot this right here is called a telescoping series telescoping series happens like this very frequently which is very nice for us because we can find a formula so this is a telescoping series tell you what let's do one more just so you get a really good idea about what I'm going to be asking you for here some of you might not like this very much but uh telescoping series really only work if you have a sum or difference of two fractions typically a difference between two fractions do I have two fractions here no no no no I don't uh now if you think of wait a minute why don't we just take a limit of that thing remember that this right here is a sequence it's just a sequence and then when I add them the terms together I get a series so I can't just take a limit of this here's the limit would tell me limit would say uh the sequence of these terms exists because it goes to zero the sum is not zero the sequence converges therefore the series is probably going to converge here but we got to show what the sum is to find out what the sum is we find the sequence of sums and we take a limit so the the work is not over just by taking a limit all that did for us was say whether the sequence is going to converge I know the sequence of these terms would converge the sequence of the partial sums I don't even know because I don't even know what this the formula is for the sequence of partial terms now because we know that telescoping series usually works with two fractions uh I might be able to try to write this out and find a pattern to it for this this the um for the series but often times it's easier to try to create something like that a telescope in series so what we're going to do we're going to take this 4 over 4 n^ 2us 1 I want try to factor that thing this would be 2 n + 1 2 N minus one you know what I think it does work out better if I do this easier to see let's do minus one plus one to minus1 2 N + one does that look familiar to you difference squares it is difference squares so we should know how to absolutely factor that guys with me on that one does this look familiar T turn it into two fractions how do I turn into two fractions equals two two okay sure two that seems right to me hey we are geniuses does that work no the common [Laughter] denom do you know what those numbers are I know you can do it but I don't know what those numbers are oh crap what's that it never leaves you you're never free you only think you're out of the Matrix too bad we're not in linear algebra you really would be in matrices that would be awesome you never have the Matrix right okay so anyway I'm going to go through this quickly you should know how to do partial fractions but understand that what a partial fraction will do for you here is decompose this thing into a couple fractions maybe those things are telescoping hopefully for us they will be so we would have 4 = a * 2 n + 1 + B * 2 nus 1 he I show hands feel okay with our partial fraction here remember that the cover up method you go okay A 2 n + 1 b 2 nus1 and then we start plugging some numbers in here's how I would do it I'd say let N = -2 and let N equal pos2 the reason why I'm doing that remember we plugging in those those uh numbers with which make one factor zero that's what we want to do so if I have - one2 here this whole thing goes to 0 do you see it I would get 4 equals if I have -2 here I get -2b n = -2 I plug in 12 for N2 in 2 * 1/2 is 1 1 - 1 is zero this whole thing's gone 1/2 here 2 * 1/2 is 1 1 + 1 is 2 4 = 2 A or a = 2 what that means for us is that now instead of thinking of that series I just decomposed my nasty fraction there into something that is hopefully telescope so series of 4 over 4 and n^ 2 - 1 is equivalent to saying the series N = 1 to Infinity can't change that uh what would our a become what is that now two two two over what plus oh minus why minus over does that look a little bit better like what we've been dealing with so far what's the next thing you're going to do find the partial sum partial sum very good so step number one is partial sum how do you find the partial sums what do you do plug in some numbers let's start where do we start one if I plug in one I'm going to get oh good I'll leave two over one minus what okay let's plug in two two over what minus am I going too fast with my adding here 2/3 okay on to the next one let's sometimes two good okay let's do next one two k remember this would be k k = 3 so 2 fths plus- 2 hopefully 7th do you guys see where those are coming from they're odd numbers uh this is a formula for odd numbers so was that one so you just plug in up hey look at that uh 1 3 35 57 blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah do you guys get this yes yes no yes now I'm going to jump down here again I want the K = nus one terms I'm not going to do the nus 2 this time I'm going to do the k equals n terms because this is a very straightforward very straightforward series when you're doing this yeah start off with one start off with plugging in two start off with plugging in three I always end with plugging in N first because it's easy to do if I plug in N I get 2 over 2 N -1 - 2 over 2N + 1 you guys okay with plugging in N it's just the ending terms of whatever this series says so F be okay with with that one now let's plug in the N minus one I plug in the N minus one we got two over 2 * n -1 - 1 - 2 / 2 N -1 + one that's 2 over 2 nus 3 Perfect 2 over 2 okay listen I know I did the fractions very quickly um what I'm asking is do you understand this idea of plugging numbers in getting it say specifically these two terms so dep hands if you do understand that okay now this one's this right I'm not going to worry about this anymore I'm worried about this look for the pattern what happens please this is the important part you guys can do this right you can do you can do partial fractions you can do that you can do this it's plug in numbers in plug in one plug in two plug in three plug in N minus one plug in N stop there now look for the pattern in your own words what's the pattern last first cool that works would this one cross out no there's no last would these cross out yes these ones this one okay how about uh let's see where am I at this one yes this one yes yes no yes n is the one that doesn't n oh you didn't put that bro that so inside I I called them insides I don't know why insides insides insides insides insides last one nope there's no next one so there's no first one there's no so yeah outsides whatever so we'd have what's left I've got a two I've got a - 2/ 2 n + 1 what's the last step folks and what's the limit of this Z two two minus zero sure but uh don't forget that you have a two right there show hands if that made sense to you guys middle people are you guys okay with this are there any questions on this right now so let's continue our talk about these these series now the next thing that we talk about in our series is specific forms of series uh so far we've talked about sequences how to tell when they're convergent or Divergent then we kind of use that idea of sequences to tell whe When series are convergent or Divergent and find the sum by doing those partial sums remember taking a limit of a partial sum gives us whether that series converges or diverges do you guys remember what we did last time hopefully well one specific series that we're going to get a lot is this thing called a geometric series what a geometric series is is this series of a very specific form like that where you have a some constant times R some base raised to an N raised to expression in terms of n where n is the uh the index that's going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 to Infinity so this isn't verify that's a series firstly look at the terms of our series the terms of our series would start with with what one well it wouldn't be one it start with a if I plugged in one I'd get R to the Z which would be one but then a * 1 would give us a and then would add to it what would add to it what would the next term be a a r very good what would the next term be sure and then the next term would be ar to the 3 and it would never ever end because this thing's going to Infinity should be okay with with that one very good okay now there is one other small change that we can do with this you could have it this way or you could have and you can verify this is the same thing or you could have a series from Nal 0 to Infinity of a r to the N can you verify that those two things are the same series for me please yeah if I plug in one hey I start with r the 0 if I plug in Z I start with r the 0 it's the same exact thing so this will give us exactly the same thing what I need you to know is that both of these Expressions stand for geometric Series so far so good now I'm going to prove something in just a bit but I want you to know a couple things before I prove it first thing geometric series converge when you probably you know what you could probably think critically about this and you could you could probably tell me geometric series converge when a is basically meaningless as far as convergent or Divergent it's a constant it will not change anything about this you can actually pull the a all the way out front and be fine with it and multiply later okay we're going to find out in our our properties at the very end of the section that we we could actually pull a out and be fine it's a constant tell me something about R these series are going to converge when R is what less than one a kind of a big number for us as far as our series go imagine if R is one if R is one then I'm going to go a plus a plus a plus a plus a plus a for Infinity if I do that forever I'm going to end up with infinity it's basically infinity times a constant does that make sense to you if R is bigger than one R is bigger than one I'm going to go a then something's going to be bigger than that and something's going to be way big then way bigger way it's going to go to Infinity if it's positive or maybe negative Infinity I don't know but it's definitely going to diverge because my numbers going to go bigger or way smaller and bigger than way smaller if it's alternating or something like that so here's a deal this is going to converge when R is less than one in terms of absolute value what that means for us we can think about it another way RS got to be between two numbers for it to converge what two numbers do have to be between yeah if you didn't think it's not just simply less than one it's actually between negative 1 and one because if you had an R being like -4 do you see that if I had R4 when I Square it's going to be huge or what not Square huge but when I Square it's going to get really big when I Cube it it'll get really big negatively and then when I take the fourth power be become positive again does that make sense to you so the whole thing about geometric series is well if you're going to add up these terms the only way that they're going to add up the only way that you're actually be able to find a sum is if these terms keep getting smaller and smaller and smaller basically it's got to be decreasing does that make sense to you in absolute in terms of absolute value it must be decreasing well the only numbers that do that the only numbers that that decrease when I take them to larger and larger powers are fractions that's the only ones that do that and so what this says is that our geometric Series yeah they can converge but they can only converge if the value of R is less than one not equal to one we already talked about equal to one right if they're equal to one you're going to keep on adding a forever it's going to grow without bound absolute value less than one is the same thing as RS between 1 and one also what's very cool about this oh you know what I can say this little correl here it will diverge if R is greater than or equal to one in terms of absolute value what's also really nice is that we have a built-in formula for the geometric series I'm going to prove this to you just a bit but I'm going to give it to you now here's our formula if you know that you fit the form of a geometric Series so basically if you know you have a constant time some number raised to the nus one where your R in absolute value is less than one you can find the sum of it and the sum's really really nice uh so here we go the sum is a over 1us R that's it you can always find the sum to these so converges when absolute value of R is less than one Divergence absolute value of R is greater than one would you like to see the proof for this why this actually happens okay let's do that so here's what I'm going to do I'm going to start with just my general geometric series here and what we learned last time was that if I want to find out what the sum is or if I want to find out whether the series converges I'm probably going to be looking for a partial sum first remember talking about the partial sums last time look for a partial sum first so I'm going to look at SMN my partial sum well what my partial sum is going to be is this we already actually have a partial sum up here already we got if I start with um help me out again with this if I start with one what's my what am I going to get and then I if I go with the next term I'm going to get and then I'm going to do a r s and then I'm going to do a r cub and I'm going to do a r now here's the deal a partial sum ends a partial sum ends at n does that make sense to you ends at n n so here's the deal listen carefully if I plug in N will my last term be a * R to the N will that be my last term no because if I plug in n i hey you know what I plugged in one I get zero I plugged in two I got one I plugged in three I got two I plugged in N I get n minus one naturally hopefully you see that this has to be my last term it's got to be a * R N1 show hands feel okay with that so far awesome now I'm going to do some kind of Fancy Pants math here what we're going to do is we're going to create another expression and then subtract these two things you're going to be a little bit fancy about it so what I'm going to do I'm going to multiply because you do believe this right this is a partial sum well it's an equation to which means that I can do whatever I want as long as I do it to both sides I'm going to multiply both sides by R so I'm going to have R * s subn equals If I multiply both sides by R understand I would have to distribute to every single one of these do you guys see that I distribute to every single one that means I'm going to have a r plus a r 2 + a r CU plus the very last term what would the very last term become when I multiply it by R very good I'd have one additional R notice if I multiply this by R it be a r n -1 * R to the first you add exponents when you multiply common bases that would be a r to the N power quick head now if you're okay with with that one now here's what we're going to do now this is kind of cool you believe this expression right just a partial sum no problem we actually had some of that on the board we're just stopping because you say partial sum goes up to a certain value of n that would be n we get our our ending term here this is a partial sum multiply both sides by R we get this one and now we're going to subtract sub ract these guys if I subtract them what we end up getting is s subn - R * s subn equals so I'm subtracting this minus this I'm going to erace these RS here basically we're just multiply by R that means you got to multiply this by R okie dokie with that one now we're subtracting s subn minus r sub r s subn got it that means we're going to have to take this stuff and subtract all of this stuff what's going to happen with most of these terms yeah in fact what's the only couple terms that don't cancel a a doesn't because there's no a down here so a the r okay squared cool boom boom a doesn't and what other one doesn't what about that one is that one going to go away yeah that one's going to be here somewhere does that make sense that's going to be here somewhere because what would happen is I'd have the a sub R sorry a * R the N minus 2 and I multiply by n that become n minus one and that would go away with this one so this is gone I'd have this one now would be a negative oh yes I'm sorry uh I wrote plus yeah we are subtracting good call good catch I would have caught it about 5 seconds but I saw the saw that I don't know why so yeah we'd have this minus this okay well that this a stays minus 0- 0us 0 minus 0 but then subtract that last one Patrick's right we get minus a * r n show P feel okay with that so far now here's what we're going to do what we're going to do right now is we're going to solve this for sub subn what that means is we're going to factor if I factor out my S subn I get 1 - R if I factor out my a I get 1 - R to the N still okay with that one last step let's just divide by 1 - R are you so far so good on this now here's the interesting thing we started with a partial sub of our geometric series I've worked it out mathematically to say this is still a formula now for the partial sum of our series basically all we've done we've made a formula out of this does that make sense to you made a formula well here's what we learned last time last time we learned that if we want to see whether this series converges what we would do is we take a partial sum and we do what with it limit limit as approaches what okay if you're if you're confused back the video up or or go and watch this video again um here's what we learned last time we learned that if you want to find out whether a series converges find a partial sum a partial sum ends at n correct but then what you do is say hey now let the end go to infinity and then your partial sum translates to your series if you let this the partial the limit of a partial sum is n approach to Infinity is your Series so this is what we had I'll write everything else for you this is equal to the limit of your partial sum that's this was last time okay this is not new stuff this is true this says if you find a partial sum for this guy and you let that n Go to Infinity that's true however we already know an expression for this I don't want this one that's nasty right I can't do a limit of that that's that sucks what I can do is a limit of this thing though so now that we've worked down to hey your partial sum is this let's just take a limit as n approaches Infinity of a * 1 - r n over 1 - R now I want to think really carefully about this what is changing and what's going to what's going to be a constant in this particular case firstly tell me what a is Conant a is a constant R the number R will be fixed depending on what your series is so it would be something like 1/2 something like 4/3 something like seven whatever negative 3 3/4 whatever that is your R will be fixed you understand that the only thing that's moving here is your N N's going towards Infinity now here's the whole point about why this is the way it is I want to give this to you first that way you understand here what's going on okay let me let me full attention ention here if R is one if R is one this would be 0 over zero that would be a big problem for for us we would have a limit that does not exist therefore we would get diverges when R equals one does that make sense to you it's clear that it will because if you plug in one for all these things you're going to get a * Infinity there you go now let's say R is more than one if R is more than one so like a number like two what's two to the infinity it's Infinity that's where this comes from if you're are an absolute value is more than one you're going to get something that is infinity here when's the only time in the world you can take a number and take it to the infinity and it's going to give you zero less what's less one when it's a fraction that's what this is coming from okay it says hey you know what if you take a fraction less than one so this equals z if absolute value of R is less than one that's where this is coming from I'm going to try to go through it one more time for you so you really do get what's going on do you get what's going on already a little bit what's going on is that this is our partial sum no matter what we have for R does that make sense to you I've proven it right here this is our partial sum for our series no matter what we have for R however if we have R for certain values we're going to get two different outcomes if R is one or more we get Divergent because this thing is going to Infinity are you with me we get infinity over constant number because R is a constant Infinity over constant is infinity it's Divergent if we have R less than one though in absolute value so between 1 and one between them well then that number raised to the infinity well that's going to go to zero 1 - 0 is a * 1 is R is a constant here we'd have a over 1us R and that is proving that proving two things here it's proving two things three things really it's proving that this series diverges when R is more than or equal to one in terms of absolute value it's also proving that the series converges when R is between 1 and 1 so absolute value of R is less than one and it's also proving that the sum is equal to this because when you think back to the last last thing we did in this class last time it said that when you find out the limit of your partial sum your your partial sums are a sequence and the ending sequence would be when ends Infinity the ending term of your sequence is still a sum it's the sum at Infinity so we we said this if your limit exists your series converges more than that because you're finding the limit of a partial sum if your limit exists it also is the sum of your series it's also what this thing equals and we just prove that show hands you feel okay with that one now do you want to see some examples yeah you're going to like these you really are promise [Applause] now in order to use this stuff you first have to determine whether this thing is actually a geometric series or not so we're going to look at it is it of the form of a geometric series yes if it is and here's how you check here show you check your first exponent should be zero it should match up with one and N minus one or zero with n does that make sense those are the two options that you have in this class so 1 and N minus one 0 and n it should have a constant if any it should have some number being raised to that power so in our case we should have an A you should be able to tell me what the a is and what the r is so tell me what's the a please three three very good does the a have anything to do with convergence or Divergence no tell me what the r is does the r have anything to do with convergence or Divergence oh heck yeah that's why we did this whole thing so you tell me is this geometric Series going to converge or is it going to diverge how do you know it's going to converge that's right the r is between Nega 1 and 1 or the absolute value of R is less than one not a problem so because we have just proven this what we know is that this series converges did we have to do any work with that nice H series converges and you should be able to tell me the sum the sum is this is the sum right here all we got to do is plug the numbers in guys it's that simple what's our a again over it should be one minus r be careful on your signs don't screw this part up 1 - what perfect 3 over 1 2 she be okay with where those numbers coming from now can you do 3 over 1 -2 yes sure that's how much three over three Hales [Music] or sure 3 over one reciprocate multiply we get two so we know a couple things it's kind of interesting right we know a couple things firstly I know because this series is geometric and we already prove it already proven it because our R is less than in absolute terms of absolute value is less than one I know it's going to converge more than that I can plug my numbers in uh make sure you don't use positive 1/2 here you will get a different sum okay you do have to plug in what the actual R is plug that in here's our a here's 1- R figured out than that we know our sum is two that's really all we got to do with geometric series what if this - one2 had been a four3 would that be a convergent geometric series or a Divergent geometric series why what if it was negative 4/3 would it still be Divergent yes absolutely the absolute value of 4/3 is still 1 and A3 it's still more than one so in those two cases we get something that would be Divergent we wouldn't have to now listen here's the whole thing okay here's the whole thing if you find that your geometric series is Divergent should you find the sum no heck no it's Divergent notice though that the formula will let you find the sum won't it you can still plug in three and you can still plug in -4 third and it will still give you an answer is the answer going to be right no so don't do that okay you first show convergent then you find the sum you do not do it the other way around you don't find the sum and say hey the sum is this but the series diverges that does not make sense at all Okie doie so show convergence then find the sum if it's appropriate does that make sense to you so this one this right here this would be diverent therefore this would make absolutely no sense to do let's move on sometimes we got to do a little bit more work with these guys I'm going to show you one of those let's say we don't have an explicit A subn but it's not given to us all we know is that this thing is 5/3 plus I'm sorry minus 5 9ths plus 527 - 5 81 plus so on so forth so it's alternating alternating signs we know five is always on the numerator and we're going 39 2781 I'm going to show you a couple ways that we want to work with this number one thing notice where our series is starting where's our series starting at one or at zero starting one what that means for you is that my exponent has to be n minus one does that make sense to you you got to match it up it's got to be zero with n or it's got to be one with n minus one now if you you just heard me understand that so I'm going be going to find an expon of nus1 for my R now how we do that well try to factor and simplify as much as you can to find that pattern so for instance I would factor out the five I would also factor out the 1/3 from this and here's the reason why what I want is for my first term to be one Okay the reason is because I'm going to have I'm take something to the zero power does that make sense so if I leave it as one if I leave it as a five and then a 1/3 does something to the Zer power give me 1/3 no but if I factor out the three as well does something to the zero power give me one then yes that's what I want does that make sense to you I'll say that one more time when you're finding your series if you start at one you're going to want to have an exponent of n minus one that's one thing we need to know second thing because I'm going to have an exponent of n minus one my very first term inside my parenthesis should be one because when I do 1 minus one it's going to give me zero for my power anything to the zero power is one that's what I need have happened now I'm going to be a little bit more pattern oriented for my next part of this instead of like something like - 1 27 I'll think about this as 3 3r instead of 1 over 9 I'll do 3 the 2 instead of 1 over 3 I'll do 3 to the 1 instead of 1 over one I'll do 3 to the AHA do you see what I'm talking about about the first Power has got to be zero this is what I needed if I would have left this as 3 to the 1st I would have had a little bit of a problem here cuz there'd be no way to for me not a real good way for me to reconcile I start at one but I'm getting a zero does that make sense if I start at one with a one well I'd have I'd be off by a negative if I did start at zero with a sorry one with an N I'd be off by my sign so we do got to factor out that 5/3 not just the five well here's what's going on then what's going on is I have 5/3 and I have look at this this is to the 0 power to the 1 power to the second power to the 3 power this is 1/3 to now we're very close let's see if it works firstly okay let's see if it works I start at one right so I need nus one power it's got to match up if I do that if I start at one my first term would be at0 13 zero then I get 1 over 3 to the 1st then second then third are you guys okay with this so far now here's the problem I'm alternating how do I fix this a negative here if I put a negative right there well shoot let's make sure that this works okay 5/3 would be there no matter what correct then my series would go through if I plugged in one I would get 1 - 1 is zero I would get one out of that that's here if I plugged in two I'd get 2 - 1 is one I'd get my negative back I'd get my one back I would get my three to the first back I plugged in three three I would get 2 - 1 is sorry 3 - 1 is 2 I would get a positive I'd get a one and I get 3 squar you see see that this is our pattern this is our our series now well that's kind of cool because now I know that this thing equals this thing 5/3 13 to the nus1 can you tell me now what type of a series that is go ahead and you discover if it's convergent if it is convergent find the sum if it's not then say it's diver stuff right there go for it I so if this thing is a geometric series we should probably be able to figure out whether it's going to be convergent or not just by looking at it is this going to be convergent yes or no yeah it's geometric it's a geometric series with a what's our a what's our R gooda 13 is that betwe negative 1 and one then this thing is going to be converted that's the first thing you say okay this converges then we find out the sum the sum of this series is how would you find out the sum sure a over 1us R did you guys do that as well 5/3 over 1 - 1 thir how much is that all said 53 54 so our sum is 1 and 1/4 how many people found it are you guys okay with this so far easy medium hard pretty easy as long as you can get down to here right once you get to here I mean this is a piece of cake this is awesome just don't do silly things don't find out that and then find things like sums that would be silly find out whether it's convergent or Divergent first and then if it converges find the sum let's do one more you see sometimes these things aren't that obvious that they are geometric series like that one does that look like a geometric Series right now no heck no but sometimes you can manipulate it well enough now here's the here's the thought process you need to focus on this one because this might leaving the dust if you're not okay geometric series match up Nal 1 to a power of n minus one you get that or be Nal Z to a power of n now if we know that then a lot of times we can manipulate our series to see if it's going to be geometric for instance here's what I would do instead of e to the N I'd try to force this thing to have an exponent of n minus one can you verify for me that e to the N is e * e nus1 okay now this is 3 n + 1 1 what I know is that 3 n + 1 is 3^ 2 * 3 n -1 can you verify that for me yes no yes okay because when you multiply common bases you add those Powers right so if I had 3 2 * 3 N - 1 it' be 2 + n -1 as my exponent that would be 2 + that would it would be n + 1 that would be my power there so F feel okay with that one guys over here are we okay with that you sure okay man hey um quick question can I separate fractions by multiplication yes multiplication is this a constant that's e over 9 this is e over 9 times e n-1 over 3 nus1 tell me something about e nus1 over 3 to the N minus one what could I do with that maybe I could make one fraction to a power couldn't I because they both my numerator denominator have the same power then this thing is the same thing as a series N = 1 to Infinity of okay e over 9 that's fine it's ugly but it's fine and then I'd have e over 3 to the n-1 now we are practically done with this problem but I want to walk through it one more time to make sure that you guys get what we're doing here first thing we're doing we're checking to see if it's geometric we're just we're looking at saying hey can I make it into something that's geometric if I can I need to look with where my n starts if my n starts at one I need to match this up to a power of n minus one did you guys get the first step yes no then try start doing that say well wait a minute then e to the N no no no I don't want to N I want 2 the nus one let's split off an e so if I go all right well e to the N I don't like that I want to think about this as e to it's close but it's not as e to the N minus one * e to the first because if I add those together I still get e then now of course I have written backwards but this is the idea try to find out the appropriate power from our Expressions here e * e nus1 no problem same thing with 3 n + 1 1 well 3 n + 1 is 3 * 3 * e * 3 N - 1 that's 3^ 2 this is a constant pull that off this I can rewrite that because they have the same power as e over3 nus1 and all of a sudden we have this thing that is a geometric series with an a of what's our a e over9 it's weird but it's e over9 what is our R now you tell me is that going to be convergent is that going to be Divergent you better know how much e is before you make that statement off it's about 2.71 or so so is this going to be convergent or Divergent yeah hey look at this this is less than one not a problem so this is going to be convergent if we want to find our sum our sum would be a over 1 - R well let's do a little bit of fraction work we'd have e over 9 over if you want a common denominator that's 3 over3 - e over3 that's going to be e over 9 3 - e over 3 reciprocate and multiply we get e over 9 * 3 over 3 - e if we simplify we get e over 3 * 3 - e it's just some fraction work but that's how we do it that would be our sum right there it's a weird sum but what I'm asking is is that a constant is that a number yes sure could you find out an approximation on your calcul L if you really wanted to you could do that uh ladies and gentlemen how many of you feel okay on getting down to this Step At least how about determining whether this is a convergent or Divergent geometric series can you do that do you see where all this junk came from then you then you know all you need to know okay the next thing rob you have a question the next thing we're going to talk about as a different type of series we're going to talk about the harmonic series most of what I'm going to tell you right now you're just going to write down as notes but they're very important notes first thing this is what the harmonic series is defined as the harmonic series would be this if you look at the series if you start plugging in one and then two and then three and then four you're going to get 1 plus a half plus a thir plus a fourth plus forever and ever and ever 1/2 1/3 1/4th 1/ fth 1 6th 1 7th 1/ eth 1 nth 1 10th and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on forever and ever and ever and ever you guys okay with that one now you would think because this is positive and because it's decreasing because it's doing that that you would get a conver series you do not the harmonic series is Divergent I won't prove it to you the proof is in any calculus B that you find it's not that hard I think you can follow it the harmonic series is actually Divergent oh this series diverges now there's a couple things we learn out of doing the proof on this thing I'm going to give to you first one is this they very interesting Concepts I I I want you to know first one is this um if a sequence going back to sequences for a second if a sequence a subn is convergent any subsequence of a subn must also be convergent does that make sense to you I say hey here's this gigantic sequence this gigantic sequence converges we know that if I cut a little bit off of it and say now let's just look at the inside part of it can this possibly diverge when the whole thing converges that doesn't make sense at all so if the sequence converges any subsection subsequence of it must also be convergent that wouldn't make sense otherwise you can't have that now the Corel of this is this sorry two sh what that means is the Cory think about it this way let's say that you had a gigantic series that you didn't listen carefully please that you didn't know was convergent or Divergent let's say you didn't know it's the whole thing okay now let's say you consider just a subsequence of that of that sequence if you find out that that subsequence is Divergent what's it tell you about the whole sequence has to there's no way for a little part to be Divergent and then come back oh but the rest is convergent that doesn't make sense okay so if a subsequence if a part of your your sequence if a subsequence is Divergent the whole sequence is Divergent so to show Divergence to show that a sequence diverges it is enough to show that a subsequence diverges that's actually what they do with the harmonic series on the harmonic series you take a subsequence you show that subsequence is Divergent to Infinity but just the subsequence of it uh it is Divergent therefore the whole sequence diverges do you guys understand these two statements hey if a sequence is convergent every subsequence has to be as well therefore if a subsequence is Divergent the whole thing has to be Divergent so sequence converges all sub subsequences have to as well but if a subsequence diverges the whole sequence must be Divergent as well couple more notes for you actually you know I still got some room so more notes you know what I'm going to write over here cuz really never mind the reason I give you this one about sequences is because we actually used that for the partial sums of the harmonic series it's what the way we proved that it's Divergent U we're going to go back to Series right now as for some more notes um these these stem from a lot of these ideas if a series converges if a series converges then the limit the limit of the sequence of terms has to equal zero what this means I hope that you you grasp on to this uh please listen carefully you remember talking about sequences and how when you take the limit of a sequence if the limit of a sequence equals a number then it converges and if it doesn't equal a number then it diverges remember that well think about this now it's not just that we have the ending terms of our sequence being numbers it's that we're adding them together so if you're see listen carefully because I don't want to blow your heads up okay um if your sequence if the limit of your sequence goes to a specific number that's not zero do you understand that you're always going to be adding more of that number so if your the limit of your sequence ends in like five oh good great your sequence converges but then for Infinity you're going to be adding 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 plus 5 what's the only number that you can keep on adding and it doesn't add to your sum Z that's what that says it says that in order for your series to be convergent in order for this to happen if if this happens if your series is convergent then what must have taken place was that this the limit of your sequence of these terms eventually has to go to zero you have to end by adding terms that are zero show pant if you understand that concept that's the idea here now what that means is that so to show a series diverges it's enough to show that the limit of your sequence of terms does not equal zero if the limit of your sequence of terms from which you are getting your series does not equal zero or does not exist the series from which we're the series upon uh the series that we're basing Upon Our sequence of as subn terms Dees here's the problem that students have with this here's the problem the students have problem students have is they think that this is a bond conditional statement they think that if the series converges the limit equals zero and if the limit equals z the series converges that is not true I'm going to say it right out flat out that is not true the times it happens sometimes it doesn't here's what I'm going to tell you I'm going to go through it one more time so I'm trying to be very clear here with you if you know I'm going to speak louder so you really hear me doesn't mean you're going to understand it more but you're going to hear me if if the series converges the limit of your sequence from which you're getting your terms for for your Series has to be zero that has to happen because you're adding terms which are going to 0 0 0 it is not true that if the limit of your terms equals zero of your sequence that the series is going converge prime example right here the limit of 1 n is z does the series converge no the series diverges and it can be proven I didn't prove it but it can be proven so if we want to show convergent we don't just do this we don't but if we want to show Divergence you go okay well cool if it converges this has to happen so if this doesn't happen it will not converge does that make sense so we can do that though we can say cool so it's enough to to show a a series divergers it's enough to show this happens so if the limit of our terms does not equal zero then what that means is we're not adding zero at the very end of our sequence we're not adding them together we're adding numbers that goes forever and ever we're gonna always add up numbers more and more and more and more and more that are the same okay or close to the same or it doesn't exist then this Series has to diverge that that's what we can do um let me say that one more time so big note limit equals z does not not necessarily I think I spelled that wrong mean convergence of your series it does not necessarily mean convergence of your series you know I was going to say one more thing I completely forgot what it was than totally for that's important too looks like we can't do our yeah too bad it'll come to me sometime okay so if the series converges this has to happen if this happens it does not necessarily mean your series converges but if this if you want to show that your series diverges just show that this doesn't happen does that make sense to you this like a condition you got to have this and something else for it to be convergent so this doesn't happen bam your Series diverges this right here I know what it was this is called the Divergence test so if you want if they're asking you hey do the Divergence test all you got to do take the limit of your terms please listen carefully if the limit of the sequence from which you were getting your series if you the limit of your sequence does not go to zero or does not exist what do you know about your series if the limit of the terms of your sequence do go to zero what do you know about about your your series it might not diverge Michael so this is due Thursday okay um there's one more thing we got to do it's super super easy uh let me show you an example of this first I'll show you one more thing we can do and then uh that's a w well you got to you got to see this one time okay at least this so we're going to use the Divergence test real quick and when I mean real quick it's going to be real quick here's your series here's how you show whether it's divergent or maybe not you take the limit as your terms approach Infinity of the terms of your series that's a sequence the terms of your series is a sequence so you take basically the limit of your sequence how much is this limit 2/3 it's 2/3 that's what it is because you divide by the larg power L rule twice whatever it is simplify you get 2/3 is this equal to zero what do you know about that series here's why because at the very end when you get towards Infinity you're going to be adding fractions together that are of the value 2/3 2/3 plus 2/3 that eventually will still go to Infinity does that make sense to you that's the whole idea we have one more thing to do it's about five minutes I'm not going to do it now don't worry uh but next time we have a little bit more to do on this section so the last little bit section 9 point whatever we're on uh we're going to talk about properties of convergent series like I said we're going to do just maybe one or two more examples so the first thing I need you to know is that if we know that our series is convergent or so basically if we're testing for our convergence what we can do with it are these two properties if we ever have a series with a constant being multiplied by the sequence from where we get our Series so like our H subn we can always pull that constant out in front of our Series so instead of having series of C * a subn it's the same thing as doing C * the series of a sub with no problems also what you need to know is that if you have a series where you have two sequences added together that are giving you the terms of the series or subtracted so added or subtracted you can split up those series by the sum or the difference so if we have a series that's of two sequences added together we can have a series of the first sequence plus a series of the second sequence that's the idea you guys okay with that one and often times this will really help you on determining whether or not your series are convergent or Divergent and if they are convergent it'll help you to find the sum so let me show you with this one final example and then I'll show you that shortcut I was talking about so first thing do you see anything that fits our two properties that we have what could we do here Theus yeah we could in fact if you think about this we can separate the fraction we could have 2 the N over 3 the N minus 5 the N over 3 to the n and then separate those series does that make sense to you yeah so we could do this and say all right well cool this is uh and = 1 to Infinity of 2 N over 3 N - 5 n over 3 n that works we can always separate fractions like that and then because I have one sequence minus another sequence inside of my series here I can separate those that series now now that we've separated our series we can actually start looking at each one and seeing whether they're convergent or not let me make one statement about this please before you keep going on this listen carefully our original series was this one correct so if we split it into Parts if we split it into these parts I don't I don't care how many there are if we split it into Parts tell me what has to happen with each part to make sure that this whole thing is convergent tell me what has to happen all of them say that louder all of them have to be convergent very good each part must be convergent for the whole thing to be convergent does that make sense to you you can't have one thing add to infinity and the other thing add to a number and go oh therefore this thing adds to a number that doesn't make sense so if any one of these parts is Divergent the whole thing is Divergent does that make sense to you yes what that means is that if you're smart about this and you see one part that's definitely Divergent boo yeah you're done does that make sense yeah I mean I mean why would you go through the process of finding the sum of one thing if you know the other things can be diverg Rob question suppose they're both convergent will they arrive at the same number these both these won't be they won't be the same number but you could add them together to get this series that's what this whole thing says okay it says uh the series of a sum is the sum of two series the sum is the sum suum will be the same if you add them together if they were both convergent does that make sense to you so here we go if we did this one thing that we could do is we could make this a series N = 1 to Infinity of 23 to the nus the series of n = 1 to Infinity of 5/3 to the N can you explain to me why I'm putting it in this format geometric that's a geometric Series yeah if we have a geometric Series right now we can tell immediately whether these things are convergent or Divergent um now there's one thing that's wrong with this picture do you see what's wrong with this picture as far as my series are [Music] concerned no one of us does I know one of us does one of us SE I see what's wrong two of us then cuz one other person said I know I know what wrong maybe they're a lying I don't know um but let's see if you know what's what's incorrect uh I told you that with geometric series in order to find the sum correctly your powers have to match up your index and your powers have to match up it's got listen in order for the sum formula to work remember the sum formula was a over 1 - R do you remember that at all yeah in order for that to work your first power must be zero is your first Power zero no okay so this formula won't work correctly now I'm about to give you a shortcut in about 5 minutes on how to get around this all right without doing a whole bunch of work there's two ways really but even if it doesn't match up exactly you can still tell me whether it's convergent or not because this R will not change even though I strip off a fraction and make my my power go down one so here's my question let's suppose my R is 2/3 would this be a convergent series yes or no 2/3 let's say this is 5/3 would this be a converged series yes no no so automatically we know this is Divergent now let's assume that they're both converging here's what you would do to get my powers to match up I would split off one power and then that reduces my exponent by one does that make sense to you you sure this is the same thing as that but now they match hey hey now it's a geometric series The Way We like to see it where our powers match and if your powers match up basically match up means when I plug in my first number my first uh n when I plug that in this power is zero please listen very carefully here if the first power is zero then a is actually the first term in my series do you understand that yeah this is always the first term in your series if these match up are you clear okay so this would be the geometric series your a is 2/3 your R is 2/3 that would be your sum it'd be 2/3 over 1 - 2/3 so hands feel okay with that one now here's my next question should I have done that no let's go to the next one minus tell me something about this series what's my what's my R again so you could you could strip this off and do n = 1 1 to Infinity of 5/3 * 5/3 nus 1 you could do that but notice when you strip off one of those fractions does your R change at all just the power change so your R is not going to ever change here tell me something about the r is it more than one or less than one greater than bam you know something about geometric series when the r is greater than one tell me about that so we got a sum minus something that is Divergent if you have a sum minus something that is Divergent this is a real number right that's something this is I don't know what that is it's Infinity actually because you have 5/3 that's getting bigger and bigger and bigger because it's more than one this is going to be Infinity so you have something minus infinity can you tell me what the sum of my series is if you have something minus infinity no if listen if you break up a series each one of these parts would have to be convergent for the whole series to be convergent if one little piece is Divergent then the whole series is Divergent n you just heard me feel okay with that so let's Imagine This was um 13 and this was 1/3 would this be converted in this case you would do 1/3 over 1 - 1/3 You' figure out this sum you'd figure out this sum and you would subtract them and that would give you the sum of your series show P if you okay with this idea now do you want to see a little shortcut when you deal with this stuff like this where the powers don't match exactly you want to see a shortcut for that yes okay sometimes I'll teach it sometimes I don't I think you guys can handle it so I'll give you I'll give you the shortcut okay so here's our formula if we have this or we have this if we have this or this well then we know that the sum would be given by those two expressions it doesn't change even though my index is different even though my power is different here's the whole reason why this doesn't change whole reason why this doesn't change is because I don't care what this is if my first power is zero that means I'm going to get a as my first term does that make sense to you it's always going to be the first term if my first power is oh 1 - one that's zero my first power is zero a is going to be my first term so basically basically listen carefully here because where I'm going to get my shortcut from basically a stands for the first term in your series look at this if I plug in zero for my n what's R the n one a would be my first term in my series you can make shortcuts with this let me give you an example I'll give you one like this one tell you what instead of actually matching this up here's what you can do with it if you understand if you understand that a is always the first term in my series then here's what I can do I can plug in one here um what's my when I plug in one what's 2/3 to the first Power I can take my first term in my Ser notice how 2/3 would be my first term in my series if I actually do this right I plug in one then I plug in two then plug in three 2/3 would be the very first one wouldn't it 2/3 over 1 - 2/3 you just take the first term you actually do the do the work plug in whatever this index is take the first term one minus whatever your R is because we know our R is not going to change by stripping off these fractions your R don't worry about your R it's never going to change it's as soon as you get in this format your R would never change you're just worried about your first term since I've shown you here that a is always your first term we can kind of cheat at it a bit did that make sense to you yeah I'll give you one more example so that way you can you can really see it okay this one's uh I think I just made this one up a little while ago and I want you want to show you so example you guys ready for it I'm going to do much with this example so stick with me of course before we do anything with this you need to recognize that this is a geometric series and the way that I see that I go well wait a minute I've got a constant easy constant to a power and I have a constant to a power that's based in N that right there says to me geometric does that make sense to you it's it's hey it's a constant to an to n and a constant to an N that means if it's not the same n i can strip some off or put some in whatever uh but ultimately I'm going to be able to get a fraction to an N power that's what says geometric about this to me now we can work with this it's not too bad if I have n = 2 to Infinity of e n over 3 n + 1 that's the same thing as 3 * 3 n show if makes if that makes sense to you now I'm going to break this up a little bit I'm going to get n = 2 to the Infinity of 13 notice my 1/3 and then I'll have e over 3 to the N I need a big show pans if you understand the algebra of this thing in the middle we okay okay now here's my point this is a geometric series correct correct yes here's my question do you know how much the a is yes if you tell me 1/3 you're wrong is the a 1/3 no no the a is not 1/3 here's why the a is not 1/3 does your index match your power which means when I plug my index in is my first Power zero that's how geometric series works okay if the first power is not zero that means this is not your first term that's the problem does that make sense to you that's the problem this has to listen I'll make it very cut and dry for these formulas to work this has to be your first term if it ain't your first term that formula don't work does that make sense so the reason why I I rarely teach I think you guys are smart enough you'll pick it up okay the reason why I rarely teach this is because people when they get this they forget that after the match and they do this they go oh my a is 1/3 I can do 1us e over3 big mistake big mistake there's now two options that you have for going around this the first option is the old way and it's not that hard all you got to do is just match up this this with this so if this is two if this is zero I need n if this is one I need n minus one if this is two I need n minus that's it so option number one you could do it the old way and just do okay if this is starting at two I can do 1/3 I can split off an e e over 3 S so basically e^2 over 3^2 I can split that off split off an e over 3 2 and then I'll have an e 3 nus 2 I'm curious do you see that this is the same thing as this do you see that yes do you see that this whole thing's a constant yes that would be n = 2 oops that's not right 2 to Infinity this would be e 2 over 27 verify that for me please this would be e^2 over 27 now let me ask a few questions about this if you plug in two is your first Power zero yes that means this is geometric and it fits my form all you have to have is the first power being zero because then what that means is this is your very first term if this is your very first term then I get to do my sum formula as e^2 over 27 1us e 3r notice how no matter what our e e over3 sorry not e 3r e over3 our e over3 is not changing even though we're stripping off parts that fraction it's not changing that's now my sum yeah of course you would simplify that right but I'm just trying to give you an example here did that one make sense to you now here's a shortcut for doing this here's a shortcut check it out from right here so or not both or if you're good at this if you're really good at this here's what you do you understand that what a is is really the first term in your series you go okay well duh if this gives me 2us 2 is zero this whole thing is one that's the first term I'd start with well you can do that from here just plug in two if you plug in two you're going to get look at that e s 9 huh e s do you see the E squ 9 I'm looking do you see the E Square 9 if you got e^2 9 e^2 9 * 1/3 is e^2 27 hey that's the first term in my series is the r going to change No 1 - e over3 do we get the same thing it's just a little bit less steps the only problem and I'm I'm praying that you see this students have an issue when they don't understand what's going on they don't understand this is the first term that's what a really stands for that that's the first term of your series and what they end up doing is go oh my a is 1/3 Mr Leonard says I don't care if those match up no Mr Leonard says care you got to care you have to this has to be an N minus 2 for you to legitimately use that formula it's got to match up your power with your index it must if it doesn't then you have to think harder you think okay well I know that a is really just my first term of my Series so if I plug in my first index of two the first term my series is not 1/3 it's e 27 that's the idea show that makes sense to you cool excellent job also one last bit of advice do not forget about the Divergence test don't forget about that you can check series very quickly by Divergence test and that's what you should do every time you get a series take a limit of it take a limit if that limit does not equal zero what do you know about your series Divergence that'll save you a lot of time on this homework okay now the next thing we're going to talk about questions so pretty much what you're doing is whatever n equals you just take it to that power if this is z minus 0 if this is 1 - one if this is 2 - 2 if this is 3 - 3 if this is four - 4 you need the first power to be zero if that's true then a stands for your first term if that's not true you figure out your first term make sense yeah yeah now 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 9.3:  Using the Integral Test for Convergence/Divergence of Series, P-Series
okay so the integral test has one idea it says can we use integrals to test for convergence or Divergence of a series and the answer is yeah yeah we can here's what's interesting uh when you think about what an integral is the integral adds up little rectangles of area don't it add stuff up well what's a series do it adds stuff up so we're going to add up areas and pretend they're like terms of our sequence that's kind of ter yeah terms of our sequence and if you add up the terms of our sequence we have a series if you add up little area rectangles well that's an integral that's what that means so we're going to use an integral to say whether or not our series is going to a finite number or whether our series is going to an infinity or whether it diverges so we pretend that our sequence is a function now I'm going to use X is in just a little bit I'm going just kind of give you the brief outline here so we let our our sequence so the terms of our series that's our sequence we let our sequence be represented by some function we say if F of n is continuous it's got to be continuous you can't have any breaks can't go to Infinity like like this can't do that it's got to be continuous it's got to be positive and it must be decreasing but if the function that we're using to represent the sequence from where we're getting our series is continuous if it's positive and if it's decreasing then we can use that integral to show convergence or Divergence of our Series so basically then this and this this is where I'm making a little jump here so uh I know I said f of n because it's based in terms of n but really this would be function in terms of X okay just like we did before um I forget what we did with that was the we used a function in terms of X with a with a sequence before we're going to do basically the same thing here we say hey if this is true if this function is continuous positive and decreasing then this series of a subn and this integral of f ofx from 1 to Infinity notice we start in one we're start in one going to Infinity going to Infinity then this integral will have either the same we'll have the same result they will both converge or they both diverge but either way they will have the same result so practically what we're doing is we're checking our integral to find out something about our series which is a really nice idea again the the the really basic idea is well um integrals add up stuff right series add up stuff let's just model our integral after our series and add the stuff up yeah we're not adding up everything in between because we're not talking about real numbers with our series we're talking about just positive integers but the idea is the same um one more thing about this is the idea is the same because I'll get to in a minute um another idea practically what's happening is that our integral is acting as an upper Bound for our series that's practically what's happening if we know that our integral is going like this so we can find the sum of this and it's a finite number then naturally if this is an upper Bound for our series our series is going to have to fit somewhere under here right or or or on it it doesn't really matter but if our if our integral is an upper bound and that integral goes converges goes to an actual number well then our series must also the integral a is an upper Bound for our series if it's continuous positive and decreasing so fans you understand the concept behind this okay now a couple key notes that I want to tell you about first key note this will tell you about convergence and Divergence if this is true if this if you can make this happen it will tell you about convergence or Divergence but it will not necessarily give you the sum so if you do the integral and the integral equals some number you go hey hey it converges that's great is the number converges to the sum of your series no it's not it just tells you that the series also converges but it doesn't tell you what the sum is does is are you very clear on that okay so this will tell convergence or Divergence but does not necessarily give the sum of this series secondly say what it sometimes can be the sun sometimes but not necessary so what is kind of cool and we get this from this we can sometimes cheat at this a little bit um you see convergence or Divergence is not affected by the addition or subtraction of a finite number of terms of your Series so if I take out the first few terms or add to it some terms in the middle convergence is not affected towards Infinity as long as it's a finite number of terms I can't add an infinite number but if I say let's add five terms or let's subtract the first 10 terms the sum would be different are you listening the sum would be different because obviously I'm adding or subtracting yes it's going to be a little different but the convergence will not be different and since this doesn't tell us about the sum anyway who cares it's going to tell us whether it converges or diverges not telling us some anyway so whether we subtract or add a few terms uh to to tell us whether we can go to the right tell whether our our integral is going to converge or not to tell us whether our series converges or not that's what we're looking at so we can sometimes cheat at this because convergence is not affected by the addition or subtraction of a finite number of terms of our series so basically here's what this is saying it says we can judge the convergence of this series with this series here's what I'm talking about um so hopefully you understand this let's say that the first few terms of this series are you listening first few terms of this series don't really mesh up real well with our integral okay we got a problem there something I don't know uh just because of continuity or positive or decreasing whatever specifically like the decreasing part is what we we go with typically the continuity is our problem with our interval typically the uh if it was our series wouldn't happen because if we had that issue if we had a discontinuity here we'd probably have a discontinuity somewhere in our series those terms W even make sense but usually for us it's going to be decreasing sometimes this this decreasing idea doesn't work so well with these exact terms so we say well let's forget the first few maybe we don't start at one maybe we start at n here's what this is saying folks it says I don't care how many terms you subract you can't subtract all of them okay but if you subtract a finite number of terms say I don't want to start at the first term I want to start at the third term I don't want to start the first ter I start at the seventh term I want start at the first ter I start the whatever the nth term big what that says is that yes the sum will be different the sum will be different don't care about that it's not going to give us a sum anyway but the convergence or Divergence will not be different does that make sense to you this is the idea some will be different the SU some will be different but the convergence will not so if our integral is affected by this we go man those terms aren't so great let's make it start a certain place therefore we can start our integral a certain place and tell us something about our original series this is the plan you guys want to see the plan in action you want some examples does this make sense to you the theory behind it it's kind of interesting right let's do a couple real fast ones just to get our feet wet okay one more recommendation I know I've said this before but I'm going to say it again and again please do not forget about the Divergence test now none of these for us are going to be Divergent uh by the Divergence test because that's too easy for us at this point but don't forget about that because on a test or a quiz or your homework or something you look at that you go okay the first thing I'm doing first thing we're off the bat I'm taking the limit of this if the limit of this as n approaches to Infinity does not equal zero what do I know about the series it's diverent don't even have to worry about it there's not going to be a sum don't have to worry about the integral because it's Divergent already here so we take the limit is the limit of 1 n^2 + 1 equal to zero yes so it says we're we're we're sure well we're not sure whether it's convergent or Divergent but it fails the Divergence test it's it's not Divergent by the Divergence test it might be Divergent some other way but not by that does that make sense do we know it's convergent no we don't know that it's basically inconclusive so here's what we do first thing is okay well um it's not telescoping can't Factor it so it's not definitely not that we can't break that up then we try the integral test because you know what I see I see let's look at FX = 1x^2 + 1 I'm not using n uh I know I did up here but I'm not using n I'm using the function in terms of X because what we're doing is we're modeling this function after this sequence and we're saying okay basically every term of this sequence is in here somewhere a lot more terms besides these terms are in here yes but at least this contains all of these terms does that make sense to you so we're going to say if this contains all these terms this will act as an upper Bound for the sequence provided it is positive provided it is continuous provided it is decreasing so let's think about this is this always positive absolutely it's x + 1 so this is positive is it continuous yes since it's always positive well yeah it's it's actually always continuous oh but wait one thing um do we have to be continuous everywhere we actually only have to be continuous on that interval right there so it's continuous yeah is it decreasing what keeps getting smaller it does keep getting smaller because this is a constant isn't it so constant by something that's going 1 2 3 4 5 it's decreasing obviously decreasing now we're going to State this on the interval 1 to Infinity because we don't care about anything else we don't care about anything else because what we're trying to do is model this function on this series this series starts at Hey where's the series start at so as long as this function is positive continuous and and decreasing on one to Infinity we are good to go show fany understand that concept okay so even if this had been like um oh man this is going to change something a little bit minus one I'll show you something here real quick is this positive not all the time yeah if it is it positive on one to Infinity no not CU you plug in 1.1 it's positive is it continuous no not at one so what you do is you go hey can I subtract a finite number of terms heck yeah let's start at two there you go is it positive continuous and decreasing done okay so we can do things like this now we're not there yet we're going to get there in the next couple examples so the next idea is shoot if you know how to model this series on a function and you know it's positive continuous and decreasing do you need to check for this every time you certainly do and you have to show each one of them some are obvious this is obviously positive obviously continuous and obviously decreasing okay then when we say is then this series and this integral from where to where of 1x^2 + 1 DX these two things because of this statement these two things will either both converge or they will both diverge that's what this says if this diverges this diverges if this converges this converges do I know the sum no but it converges don't know what two but it converges do you see it that's why we did last chapter what is that oh no no no no no it's improper inter it's an improper integral which you must show me appropiately how you solve you remember thing about appropri integrals that's an infinite interval one to Infinity we say hey B goes to Infinity take a limit of that no problem do we know how to do the integral of 1x^2 how much is the integral of 1x2 + 1 it's tan inverse if you didn't know that you could do your triangle x^2 + 1 you could do your X over one hey tangent look at that tangent you have a secant squar in there somewhere it simplifies get the integral of one that integral of one would be Theta Theta would be tan inverse of X so this right and look you can look that up for our I've done that example several times so look that up in the video or in your notes this right here is the limit as B approaches Infinity of tan inverse X from 1 to B integral of this is 10 inverse X going from 1 to B no problem we have a limit still yeah of course we have a limit still what's the next step what are we going to do evaluate it it sure we got 10 inverse of B minus tan inverse of 1 now you better be able to tell me what tan inverse of B and what tan inverse of one are you might want to have your your unit circle out or have something out that lets you see this pretty easy for me it's not a big deal because well of course you know I know this in my head if you don't know in your head have a little cheat sheet when you're doing some of these problems especially with our tangent so let's think about tan inverse of b as B goes to Infinity tan inverse looks like this tan inverse looks like that where you have a horizontal ASM toote here at pi over 2 and a horizontal as here/ 2 so this is 2 as tan inverse approaches I sorry as B approaches Infinity tan inverse of B approaches p 2 minus tan inverse of 1 it's 4 because tangent of Pi 4 = 1 tan inverse of 1al Pi 4 equals now question did we get a number yes this limit this limit this is why the limits are important this limit tells you that the limit exists right this says the limit exists therefore this improper integral was convergent that's where we had the F that convergent the first word right the first time we had that was in improper integrals because the limit exists the integral is convergent because the integral was convergent based on this function which was positive continuous and decreasing which acted as an upper Bound for our series if this thing is convergent tell me something about our series good so both the integral and the series are convergent do I know what the sum of my series is is this the sum of my series not necessarily I don't know but we know that that series converges show fans if you understand the idea of this kind of a cool idea right let's practice a couple more examples get right into it I'll try to do as many as possible in our time allow here for you okay so I'm I'm still going to walk you through this because I know you guys are fresh fresh at this only one example so the first thing we do first thing is my goodness take a limit take a limit if the limit does not equal zero the series diverges now most of these I'm giving you here they're not going to that's not going to happen but I want you to get happen to that is the limit of this thing zero as n approaches Infinity yes it is constant over infin is infinity so the limmit is zero does that make sense that means we got to keep going with something the something here is going to be our integral test so we're going to base our function on our Series in terms of X of course then we're going to check for three things what are the three things we must check for for the integral test to work for everything or just a certain interval aha so is this positive not always not always but I don't care about that is it positive on where am I starting is it positive on this interval yes yes is it continuous on this interval notice that 1/2 would be a discontinuity does that make sense is 1/2 in my interval then I do not care is it decreasing on my interval that's a constant over a variable that is growing bigger decreasing so feel okay with that positive continuous decreasing well then what we're going to do is say since this function is positive continuous and decreasing on my interval the same interval as my series I'm going to take an integral of this the integral will act as an upper Bound for my sum my series if the integral converges this thing converges if the integral diverges this thing diverges so let's take our interval integral where's our integral start one yeah same thing as this 1 to Infinity so wherever this function is positive continuous and decreasing that's where you integrate do you guys see how many times you're going to be using limits here these are all going to be improper integrals so we're going to have a limit as B approaches Infinity from 1 to B of 3/ 2x - 1 DX oh my gosh it's an easy one tell me what we should do with integral of 3 2x -1 pull three out do do a Uub very easy if we do a Uub we're going to get U = 2x - 1 du = 2x DX sorry 2dx du over 2 = DX so long story made real short we have a limit as B approaches Infinity of 3es integral 1 over U du well that's a li um I'm going fast here is that okay with you that I'm doing these integrals really quickly yes just because well frankly I mean we should know how to do all those anyway you guys okay with this one so far we go hey you know what um 2x + one 2x - one is our U so we have three halves pull it up front integral 1 over U no problem du integral one over U is Ln absolute value of U now tell me something when I plug in my 2x - one do I need the absolute value here yes well think about my interval do I need the absolute value here no I don't what I do need to do is evaluate from one to B and then take my limit so let's do that this would be a limit as B approaches Infinity of three Hales you know what you can do you can even pull three halves all the way out front if you want to you don't even need it here a constant can be pulled out in front of a limit so let's do that let's have three Hales up front we'll have Ln of 2 B -1 minus Ln of 2 - 1 I got to make sure you guys are okay with this before we go any further are you guys okay with this one because it's always positive don't we never need the absolute values on any of them don't we never need I don't uh you know I I can't I'm not going to make an absolute statement there it's going to have to depend on what you have what if you had x's over X's I'm not sure okay I don't know how work there I'm I'm not going to make an answer I don't know what I want to know is are you okay making it this far yes this is exactly the same stuff that we've done already in this class well see what pull out three Hales of course that's you know we do that for a while so three halves out front tell me um what's 2 - one what's Ln of one what's uh B here going to Infinity what's 2 * Infinity INF Infinity minus one infity what's Ln of infinity is this integral convergent or divergent This thing is infinity minus 0 that's infity * 3 this is infinity therefore this integral is Divergent tell me something about the series is the series going to be divergent or convergent this is interesting because I said the integral X is an upper bound it also acts as a lower bound it acts as a bound so the integral is the Bound for our our series it's either an upper bound if it converges or a lower bound if it diverges which is really neat therefore the series also diverges and this is exactly the way you st on your homework and you test you say the integral diverges therefore the series also you don't just end it with diverges you make a statement about the series you say okay so they're both convergent or they're both diverging you say because this one diverges the other one diverges makes some sort of a statement like that so hands feel okay with with this one tell you what I'm going to talk about one more thing we're not going to finish this but I want to show you something while we're we're Super Fresh on this material Min fresh minty fresh calculus fresh aqua [Applause] fresh Okay so this is the first time we've had an N function over an N well not function but an N over an N the first thing you would do here check your limit now if you did lows you're going to find out that this limit does equal zero but you would check by the Divergence test first are you with me on that one always check that secondly you go okay well you know what I know that this series if I model this function after that that sequence after the sequence and I determine that the integral of this function is convergent the series convergent Divergent the series Divergent as long as this is positive continuous and decreasing now let's talk about those three things and then we'll end for today okay uh so is this positive should be X oh I'm sorry thank you yeah good yeah my bad good save good catch not M crush anymore tepid and rancid whatever uh FX Ln X over X is is it positive yes is it always positive no no is it positive on this interval yes yes after one Ln of one is zero after that it's positive over something that's always positive after one you'd have something that is positive is it continuous the only discontinuity here would exist at x equals what it would be discontinuous for both of them actually after that it's continuous is is it decreasing this is not an obvious one obviously decre here obviously decreasing that's a constant that's over number that's growing that's decreasing this one not so obvious this time you're going to have to check for decreasing so here's our check for decreasing you must show these things show decreasing how I would show decreasing with a function man I would take the derivative of that function do you remember doing that now we just did that stuff right to show that this is decreasing if it's decreasing the the derivative has to be negative decreasing means the derivative is negative so if we do the derivative it's low D High minus high D low Square the bottom and away we go so our first derivative is 1 - Ln x^2 you guys okay with that so far well here's the whole thing we're trying to show decreasing correct we're trying to show when this thing is less than or equal to zero that's what we're trying to show now here's the whole point is X2 ever negative then this will only be negative when 1 - lnx is negative this happens when this happens you guys okay with that one yes no are you sure yes yes yes yes no okay if I solve for this I get 1 is less than or equal to Ln X that's not good enough I want to solve for x well if I take both sides as an exponent of e e to the first would be less than x e the L and X is X so take e on both sides don't take e that's bad for me uh but put e on both sides this is X B here's what this says to me and hopefully to you what it says is that this function is certainly positive it's certainly continuous it will be decreasing as long as X is bigger than or equal to e how much is e 2.7 then what if I made this three if I said this is decreasing on 3 to Infinity would it be true yes if it takes X being bigger than or equal to e to be decreasing then this the function will certainly be then f ofx is certainly decreasing on three to Infinity because 3 is bigger than e it said X has to be bigger than e well 3 is bigger than that therefore this is also decreasing on the interval from 3 to Infinity so our integral where's our integral I'll see if you can put all together where's our integral going to start three three not one it's not decreasing there but just start at three this was the um this is the first thing that we talked about one of those notes it said that I can subtract a finite number of terms listen carefully the last little bit okay I can subract a finite number of terms I'm subtracting the first term and the second term I'm starting at the thir third term I don't want to start at e okay I want to make this an actual integer that matches up with our series I'm going to start it at three so check positive check continuous you guys okay with the decreasing part of this derivatives have to be less than zero for decreasing so show it hey look it this would be less than zero when this happens or when this happens take e on both sides when this happens X has to be bigger than e make it three three is Speaker than e therefore this will be positive no problem continuous and decreasing on 3 to Infinity starts your integral at three we'll finish it up next time so we're going to finish up this problem so if you were with us last time what you saw was whenever we have these series and we can determine that our function that's based on our series is positive continuous and decreasing we can take integral of that function and what that function does it stands for a lower Bound for Divergence or an upper Bound for convergence basically it says that uh every term of this sequence from which our series is built is found in this function therefore if the integral of this function remember integral means add up stuff if the integral of this function diverges means the sum or a series is also going to diverge if the integral converges means the sum of the series is also going to converge that's the idea that we have now does the integral necessarily tell us the sum of of our series no it doesn't give us the sum it just tells us whether it will have a convergent sum or a Divergent sum that's basically idea so what we've done here so far is said all right let's call this function lnx overx we've modeled it on our sequence we've determined hopefully obviously to you it is of course positive it's definitely positive that's positive and that's positive after one therefore positive over positive gives us a positive it's definitely positive after one it's continuous the only problem we would ever have is at zero since zero is outside of our inter interval from 1 to Infinity no problem the problem we came across with this problem was the decreasing how we show decreasing often times with our functions take a derivative if a derivative is less than zero if a derivative is negative that means that our function is decreasing if a derivative is positive that means our function is increasing for a given interval what we're trying to show is that this function is always decreasing does that make sense to you so we take a derivative our derivative you should know how to do that we say okay when is this derivative going to be less than zero well this derivative is less than zero when the numerator is less than zero you see the denominator is always positive so it can't change your sign so it's always the numerator less than zero for this example no problem well if the numerator has to be less than zero for a derivative to be less than zero that means that one's got to be less than Ln X if I take e both these sides as an exponent upon e I'm going to get e to the first is less than e to lnx no problem what that basically says is that is this the derivative of our function will be negative when X is greater than or equal to e that's the idea does that make sense to you so basically it says our function is decreasing everywhere after xal e that's what it says well then what we're going to do is we're going to pick some number after this after e well what's slightly bigger than e three three is we're say well you know what tell you what did you follow this logic down by the way yeah decreasing means less than zero that means this would have to be less than zero that means this would have to happen this would have to happen and X would have to be bigger than e that's what that says well Pick X = 3 and then we know for sure that our function will be decreasing at xal 3 and further all the way to Infinity show fans if you if that makes sense to you now the re why we're allowed to do this I gave you the statement last time you can actually add or subtract a finite number of terms from your series and that the resultant of convergence or Divergence will not change so I know that our series where's our Series start where's our integral going to start that's two terms difference actually so we would ignore the first term and the second term and start of the third term is the sum going to be the same no it's going to be different who cares it's not going to give us the sum anyway so it's just going to tell us well if I subtract a finite number of terms who cares it's going to give us whether this this series is convergent or Divergent anyway does that make sense to you I think I explained last time but I wanted to make sure that you guys actually got to it so we check positive easy check continuous easy on this interval on one to Infinity that's both positive and continuous good to go decreasing take a first derivative work it down find out what x has to be for this function to be decreasing for us it's anything bigger than e well 3 is bigger than e so let's make our intergral from 3 to Infinity now what that says is that the integral of this function will have the same result as the series does either both will be convergent or both will be Divergent so we just got to do this integral fortunately for us man it looks so familiar we've done that that's an improper integral so what's our first step with an improper integral please Li from what from 3 integral from 3 to B lnx X DX now of course we're kind of past the whole integration phase of this class we're still going to use it but these are going to be quite a bit simpler than what you're used to so think easy on these things right now how would I do this you what's our sub y du = 1X DX do you see it it's right there this is X therefore we have a limit as B approaches Infinity the integral from 3 to B of well since I do my substitution U equal Ln X so I'm going to have U du is 1/x DX so du is this piece well that was pretty pretty painless that means we're going to get L limit of u² over 2 as B goes to Infinity from 3 to B so fancy feels so far so good on this thing now there's one little issue what's the little issue that we have bounds are different from our variable right now and since we haven't changed bounds what we're going to have to do is we're going have to resubstitute back in so instead of having u^2 over two we're going to make this the limit as V approaches Infinity of2 uh what was our U anyway and take that from one to B sorry 3 to B my you all okay with that so far cool let's go for it is any of this hard for you at this point no we know how to do simple inter it's not a problem we know how to evaluate so when we do this we're going to have a limit B goes to infinity looks like it'll be 1 12 lnb sarus 12 Ln 3 squ can you please tell me what's going to happen what's going to happen with this limit what is um what's ln3 no idea but this is going to be some sort of constant isn't it so this is going to be some constant how much is Ln b as B approaches in remember B is approaching Infinity how much is Ln B what's infinity s still infinity infinity minus a constant tell me something about this integral is it is this improper integral convergent or Divergent why toity the limit goes to Infinity therefore this integral is Divergent so or the integral diverges now what we said was because this function is modeling this series it contains every term of our sequence and it's adding stuff together just like our our our series would do a series adds the terms well the function basically adds up areas basically the same thing since this is modeling this it's an upper Bound for convergence it's a lower Bound for Divergence what that means that is if our limit of our integral basically if our improper integral diverges tell me something about our series yeah you have to say that okay you don't just leave it diverg it done you say so because the integral the improper integral diverges the the series also diverges so we say so series of lnn /n also diverges quick show hands feel okay with with the so far all right well tell you what we got a little bit left to do in this section I'm going to go through what what what called what is called the P series uh go through that one I'll do one more example of this very similar to this problem just to get our our brains wrapped around one less time and then we're basically done with our section so last little bit we get to talk about is something called the P series here's what the P series stems from it says suppose you got a series suppose it starts at 1 to infinity and it's 1/ n to the P where P does not change the N is what changes I want you to think about what this would look like okay let's think about the first few terms just to get our headr around what what the world the P Series so notice n's our Index right n is what's changing so would the P change no no the p is going be something like two three four whatever uh P's going to be a some sort of a positive number not equal to one well it could be one but then we have something that's not very interesting so here's what happens actually is interesting it's just something we've already covered I should say it that way here's what happens if I plug in one I'm going to have one over what what is n one what's one to any power one excuse me hope I didn't blow the speakers out on people's computers that was loud well if p is a power hey P power cool if p is a power then I'm basically taking one over one to the whatever power it's going to be one do you see that so I'm going to get one for my first term next I'd get one over what would my NB two what would my P be I don't know it'd be whatever I tell you it is it's going to be two to the P plus one over what's the next one going to be 3 to the what the is the P changing no it's going to be whatever's defined in your Series 3 to p + 1 4 to P plus forever that's what a p series does it's basically taking your n and raising it to some power over under one one over whatever that happens to be you guys okay with the idea of a p series now we're going to talk about when this converges and when this diverges and basically we have everything in hand to do that so this will always converge when something happens and it will diverge when something happens it's not going to be based on the N this time because n is going to go through its its sequence of numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 it's going to be based on the P so can you tell me let's let's talk about the Divergence first can you tell me when this series would diverge what do you think when p is neg you're right when p is NE there's also one more thing one what about one one now now listen carefully if p is 1 if p is 1 we would get 1 + 12 you know WR over here when p is 1 we would get 1 + 12 + 1/3 + 1/4 are you seeing where these numbers come from yeah tell me what series that is you should know that's harmonic series very good is the harmonic series convergent or Divergent diver diver very good so what we know is that it's not only negatives but it's actually anything less than one anything less than or including 1 does that make sense to you this is a harmonic Series so when P equals 1 it's Divergent if p is less than 1 if p is less than one well the Divergence test will actually show that to you if p is less than one imagine this this is actually we for both but if you take a limit of 1/ n the p as n approaches Infinity if you do that and P is less than one we're going to get something that's Divergent for sure now when will this converge when p is when p is greater than one you can think about this if p is greater than one then 1/ n p if you model this with the function if p is greater than one this is positive yes any positive number ra to any power should be positive this is continuous and is never zero it's also decreasing on the interval 1 to Infinity because this will give you positive continuous and decreasing we basically I'm kind of skipping a step here okay you'd model this on the function of x to the P FAL x to the P this would be positive continuous and decreasing if that's the case sorry I'm trying to go faster than I really should we'd model this on FX = 1X p and if we did that this is positive this is continuous this is decreasing therefore by the integral test also all the the integral this thing is always going to be uh we're going to find something that that converges integral test is going to tell us this is also convergent so because of this so here's the thing one more time if you have your p as less than or equal to one if you have your p as less than or equal to one what do you know about your P series harmonic series or anything lower than that for for power is going to diverge if you have your P greater than one not equal to one one's over here okay if you ever P greater than one what do you know about it it's got to because any sort of a function like this where p is more than one your integral from 1 to Infinity of 1x P DX it's going to converge you can do the limit on that if you want to uh you do a li from you do a limit uh of whatever your integral says from 1 to B 1X to P DX if p is greater than 1 this becomes a pretty easy integral to do this would be like x to the -2 or x to the 3 or X to the4 are you with me on this one whatever's going to happen is you would add one to your power that would give you at most x to the 1 if you add one to your power does that make sense to you because you you'd have at least x to the 2 there well that's not quite true you could do this with decimals as well but you'd have something that would still be a negative exponent does that make sense that would be one over infinity when you plugged in that b one over infinity gives you that 0 plus whatever constant you have that's going to be convergent so we have something that is convergent here show hands if that made sense so you feel okay with it okay so P series diver p is less than equal to one p series converg p is greater than one by our integral test and you can do this in general when p is greater than one now let me show you how this works and how nice this is trust me you're going to like this here's why you're going to like it I want you to consider that series firstly is that a specific type of series that you know yes yes is it geometric no it's not geometric but we have lots of different types of series here is it a piece Series yeah very good hey what's the p is two more than one yes tell me about the series am so you have to State something like this you say okay this is a p series the p is 2 which is greater than one therefore this series converges do I know what the sum is no do I know what converges yep that's what a asking here so depend if you if you like that stuff huh don't you like that let give me 30 of these on the test huh 100% 100% we'll kick some calculas in this [Music] class okaying now you tell me what type of series was that it's still a p series now you might want to write it as a p Series so how in the world is that a p series well it's a series N 1 to Infinity 1 / n to the every type of root is automatically a power this is a power so we say this is a p series p is equal to what's our P now remember this is not zero it's not talking about ative of course every negative p is going to give us a Divergent uh series here but it's not zero it's less than one so even if we get something like 1/3 what's that tell us about our series here this is less than one or equal to one you can put that too less than or equal to one therefore this series diverges is this making sense to you yes kind of nice little break from doing all the other stuff right okay we'll do uh we'll do one more true or false this is a p series true or false false true or false that's a p series but wait a minute it's not one over something power you better be smart enough to do that right okay so if you have a if you got a negative power you need to understand that this is the same thing as 1/ n to the positive Pi power that's a weird power but I didn't say anything about P being an integer I didn't say anything about that all I said was P was a power p is an exponent if p is less than or equal to one your P series diverges if p is more than one your P series converges so is this a p series yes it is you might want to write it as such so it's a p series the p is what's the p yeah Pi is about 3.1415926 something whatever I don't know the rest of them uh but what I'm asking is is that bigger than one or is that less than one that's more than one so what does our P series say about that because we've done this in general or p is anything bigger than one we can say that all the time we don't have to reinvent the wheel and prove it every time we know that if p is less than equal to one that series is going to diverge if p is more than one that series is going to converge you better make darn sure that it actually is a p series though okay so spend some time really think about it but if it is goodness gracious isn't that nice so if you don't recognize the P series you have a lot of lot more work that you're going to have to do right you do the integral test with this when you don't actually have to we've done the integral test basically once and for all for this this is what we why we talked about this stuff if you didn't catch that go back and Rewind it or or watch this video watch the video again or something to catch that the P series P series here really is an integral test over and over and over and over and over and over and over again that's all it is if you have any P listen listen if you have any power that's less than one any power less than like 1/3 what happens is that this is this would become x to the 1/3 power correct you would add one to it on an integral that would become POS 23 power when I let B approach Infinity that is going to approach Infinity that series is going that that limit is going to diverge that means my integral diverges that means my series diverges does that make sense to you that happens anytime your p is less than or equal to one if it equals one you got L and X we already determined that well this this harmonic Series diverges so that takes care that equal to one anything less than one I'd have X to a p power if p is less than one when I add one to it X gets to a positive power does that make sense what that means is that when I evaluate my limit as B approaches Infinity that thing's going to go to Infinity that's why anytime p is less than or equal to one I get a series of diverges the opposite is true for convergence if p is more than one I would have x to the ne P correct but if p is more than one when I add one to it the power is still negative that means I have 1 over X to some power I don't care what it is when B approaches Infinity that's going to approach zero make sense then I'd have a constant or something therefore my integral would converge that's the whole idea so don't be doing integral test all this stuff it's it for sure would work absolutely but we've only done it like once and for all here so don't reinvent the wheel that's the whole point show hands if you understand the point good deal tell you what we're not going to do any more P Series this is hopefully straightforward to you I want to do one more kind of a little bit more advanced idea of um of series show you what you can and can't do with it basically dealing with a little bit more with how to show uh decreasing because the whole integral test says you got to have something that's positive you got to have something that's continuous and you have to have something that's decreasing so I want to go through one more of those and then we'll call it good on this section you guys have any questions on the P series at all that I can answer for you yeah pretty much the only qualification for that your variable has to be in your denominator just to any power it can't be like added to anything right it just has to be like you know variable to power then you use P Series in your denominator I didn't quite catch that like all right like for p series your your give me an example uh let's just say one over what let just say 1 over n to the 7th plus one you couldn't use P series on that like that yeah no it just has to be that but in the next section we're going to cheat a little bit and do it oh all right cool you want to see how sure is this for sure less than 1 n 7 it sure is yep does that converge P series if this is always less than that one tell me something about this one now converges comparison test that's the next section now so yes we are going to use the P series a lot Okie doie a lot but we're going to normally do it it's not as easy as what I gave it to you we're going to normally do it as a comparison test we're going to base our other series on something we already know about we're going to base them on geometric series we're going to base them on P series we're going to compare them to them I'll show you how to do that but first I want to do this example okay so here's how we would go through this I kind of did this for integrals for you so I'll kind of show you how to do this for series as well the thought process the thought process is the first thing you check for is the diver test that will be the first thing you check for in this case the Divergence test is going to show you because you do a couple well L TS rules there you're going to get a zero out of that then your diverence test tells you zero what's Divergence test say if it's not zero what happens if it is zero what's it say maybe be not Divergent don't know undetermined we got to figure this thing out okay so for us we already determined that next thing you check for is this a simple series is this a geometric no it's not here's how you tell is it a number raised to the N under a number raised to the N no no it's n raised to a power that's not a geometric series does that make sense geometric is a constant raised to a power this is not that and you can't make it that so no it's not geometric is it a p series no no it's got to be one over something that would be a p series there does that or a constant over something because a constant you can fold out this is not a constant does that make sense so Divergence test well it's it's it is equal to zero so it might not be Divergent get check geometric series no P series no and hopefully you just caught on how to check for that because I just explained it right now so what's our our last option for us right now well our last option is an integral test so we got to look at this thing and pretend that we get a function of X actually make a function of X that models this sequence e 1X x^2 okay in order for you to use integral test and you guys should all know this in order for you to use an integral test what must this function be on my interval for my series what must it positive very good what else Contin Andre the hardest one to show is usually decreasing decreasing positive is pretty easy to show you just go uh that's always positive because it's e to some power that's always positive because it's squared positive over positive is a positive it's definitely positive does that make sense to you continuity continuity is usually pretty easy to show this is only discontinuous at zero that's it e is continuous everywhere e to a power is always continuous how about uh X2 well it's always continuous except at zero do we ever hit zero in our interval no it's always continuous hard one here is decreasing decreasing you go I don't know how do you do how do you show increasing for a function you got to do one of two things you got to show that a subn + 1 is less than a subn which is sometimes very hard to do or you take a derivative if it's something that you can take derivative of that's probably the easy way if you have n factorials and things have do you know how to take a derivative of a factorial yeah no so you'd have to show that a subn plus 1 is less than a subn and go for that way show that it's decreasing we did that once if you remember do you remember that with SE we did it in this case because I don't have any factorials I have nothing horrible going on and I can take a derivative of this you can always show decreasing of functions by showing the derivative is what decreasing functions always have derivatives that are negative so if we can show that this is NE this derivative is negative for our interval we show that this is decreasing on the entire interval now here's here's a little Cavo I showed this before if it's not decreasing on the entire interval is there a point where is decreasing if there is a point where it's decreasing like like last time it was decreasing after e remember that if there's a point then we can subtract a finite number of terms from our series and get the same result they're both going to converge or diverge so it's just find out whether this thing is decreasing on a certain interval and that that's all about the derivative so we're going to take the derivative I'm going to do it very quickly um I know you guys know how to take derivatives so if you do the derivative remember it's not lobit talls it is a quotient rule it's low minus high D low Square the bottom away you go so low D High gives you x^2 e 1X * x² uh sorry * 1 over X2 1X s minus so that's low D High minus high D low Square the bottom and way spend some time on your own if you need to and do that derivative on your own I'm doing it really quickly of course but chain rule it work here don't forget about those chain rules we'd have low derivative of e e 1X is e 1X * 1X by the chain R keep the high one derive the low one you get 2x e the 1 over X and then Square the B so if we do this we're going to get e 1X - 2x e 1X all over x 4 let's make this a little nicer we're going to factor out NE e 1X if I factor out e 1 /x what we're left with is POS 1 + 2x can you verify that for me that if I factor out e to 1x I get pos1 + 2x can you verify that okay over x 4 tell me what we just found derives derivatives derivatives show decreasing when they are okay so what we got to ask our question is is this thing negative is this thing less than or equal to zero on my interval well let's think about it all you're trying to do is show it you're just trying to show that it is decreasing if you can't show it if it's not decreasing you can't use this stuff so hopefully it's decreasing for you let's see where does our interval start here one it starts at one is this decreasing on one well let's let's think true or false this is always positive true or false this is always positive if x is greater than or equal to one I don't care about negative numbers series doesn't start negatively starts at one so this is always positive right this is always positive yeah now think about this one is this always this without the negative is this this always positive e to any power is always positive so we got a positive we got a positive we got a posit so you're telling me for any value of x this expression will be positive correct are you sure me too because that's positive that's positive and that's positive when X is greater than one what would that do so is this always negative for X is between 1 to Infinity this is positive for xal 1 to Infinity this is positive for xal 1 to Infinity this is positive for x = 1 to Infinity therefore this whole thing is negative when x = 1 to Infinity because my first derivative is negative on this interval because my first derivative represents increasing or decreasing because my first derivative is negative on this interval it shows that it is decreasing on this interval that's the idea that's the hard part the rest of it's pretty easy so FY if you understand that part you feel okay with it can you go ahead and try to do the rest of this try to do that integral okay go for it see that you still have the chops to do integration so because this function is positive continuous and decreasing and because it's based on the sequence of our the sequence from which we get our series the integral from one Whatever interval is where it is positive continuous decreasing our interval is 1 to Infinity where that happens our integral from 1 to Infinity e to the 1 /x x^2 DX will have the same result as our series if this is convergent our series is convergent this is Divergent or series Divergent of course what we know is that this is an improper integral we must treat it as such [Music] yay did you find the appropriate substitution not so bad right not so bad it's just a substitution most of these things are going to be just substitutions for you not horrible if you do U = 1X then our integral becomes from 1 to b e to the the U now what else happens let's see if you if you did this right you guys okay with the U equals 1X reason why we see this is because the derivative of 1x is 1x^2 somehow without the constant so that derivative is up there this counts as a 1x^2 so U = 1X du is 1x2 not a problem move the negative over here netive du = 1x2 DX that is this piece right here so what is after my e cool that's about the easiest integral I can think of right there actually so this is a limit as B approaches Infinity of what is it going to be negative I like the negative what from 1 to B now there's a problem here do we want to plug in B and one right now no if you do this you're going to get a Divergent limit you're going to it's going to look like it's if you if you plug this in what's the what's the big problem with doing that these aren't in terms of U they're in terms of X actually so for us we absolutely must substitute back in before we evaluate our limit so this has to be e to 1 /x that's going to make a big difference did you catch that you got to make sure you substitute in make sure your bounds match match your variables your bounds are in terms of X which they will be your resultant from your integral better be in terms of X as well so we need to make sure we substitute back in if we've done a substitution well what that means is we got a limit as B approaches Infinity e^ 1 B minus E 1 over 1 let's see what we got personally did you get the same thing as I did good good for you that's fantastic how much does this all make this going be plus e somehow negative negative well minus negative is plus e the 1 is e how much is let's do this how much is B going towards how much is one over infinity is e to Z so this whole thing equals -1 Plus or E minus 1 now do I care that it's -1 + e or E minus1 well not so much because it doesn't necessarily give me my sum for my series but what's it tell me about this limit this limit is is equals a number doesn't equal Infinity it's not it does not exist limit it converges so what's it tell me about my series from where I got this so by the integral test this is convergent so this converges so my series also converges and that ladies and gentlemen is what the integral test does for you it will have the same the the integral if your function from where you that's based on your sequence is positive continuous and decreasing on an appropriate interval sometimes subtracting some terms sometimes not finite number terms if that limit of your improper integral converges your series converges if that limit of your improper integral diverges your series also diverges show fans if that made sense to you do you guys have any questions at all on on any this stuff yes no n s not n the N what I do n the N series your series oh cool I just like NS all right assuming all right well that's it for the that's it for theal test next thing I want to give you is the comparison test what do that next time 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 9.4:  The Comparison Test for Series and The Limit Comparison Test
all right so today we're going to talk about the comparison tests uh as I was mentioning before I gave a preview of this in the last section we're going to talk about two types of tests firstly the comparison test and then secondly the limit comparison test test which I just said was very powerful so the comparison test we had a taste of this in sequences and the idea is if you can compare one sequence to another sequence where you know a relationship like one is always smaller than another or one is always bigger than another then sometimes you can use the convergence of one sequence to tell the convergence of another sequence or we can use the Divergence of one sequence to tell the Divergence of another we're going to use that same idea with series rather than sequences so here's the idea um the idea is we're going to compare one series to another series that we already know the convergence for whether it converges or diverges typically that's going to be like a geometric series or it's going to be like a p series you guys do I need to write that down or you guys got the idea do I need to write down okay I better write that down so here's the idea compare one series to another where you already know the convergence or Divergence typically this is the series that we've already talked about in this class like a geometric series or a PE series or a harmonic series simp like that so here's where the comparision test comes in says all right so suppose we have two series we have a series of a subn and we have a series of B subn and both of these are series with positive terms so suppose the series of a sub and the series of B subn are series with positive terms well there's going to be two cases and I'm hoping that you see the similarity between this comparison test for series and the comparison test that we had for sequences so here's the idea let's suppose or let's say if let's say a subn is less than or equal to B subn for every term so basically here's what we got we get these two series they both got positive terms but here's what we know we know that the series of a subn every term the sequence of that basically every term term by term a subn is less than b subn so for the first term a subn is less than or maybe equal to B subn next one as subn is less than or maybe equal to B subn and so forth and so forth and so forth so basically if I have my B subn like this my a subn is right below it or maybe equal with it but it's never above it do you guys understand that idea so term by term a subn is less than b subn quick hit not if you're you're all right with that let's further suppose that B suban that series converges what's going to happen what's going to happen if I have my Bend and I have my as subn and I say hey tell you what uh they're both positive terms so they're both above zero and I say for every single one of these terms a subn is less than or maybe equal to B subn it could be right on top of it who cares it's just not greater than that I say furthermore what I know is that this series when I add all these terms together for B sub this series converges so if the series of B subn converges and a subn is always less than that but it's never negative right it's always positive so it's basically it's bounded and it's less than a series that's convergent what's going to tell you about this uh the series of a what's going to happen with that it has to be so here's what the comparison test says it says compare one of your sequences to another one where you know the convergence for there's going to be two scenarios the scenario is going to be well if a subn is always less than b subn if b7n converges if the series of BN converges where add all together goes to one number then if as is always less than that it also has to converge okay let's see if you're paying attention I know some of you guys look like you got sleepy eyes so uh let's focus right now so now let's do this one okay check up here Eyes On The Board now let's suppose that b suben diverges if as subn is always less than B subn and B subn diverges what does it tell you about as subn why not is below it's below it well as suben is below the B sub so if B suben converges yeah if a is below it it's also going to converge that makes sense because it's kind of pushing it down here and getting closer and closer and closer to one number if I add those together when we're talking about the series now not just the sequence but the series so if the series of B sub converges and a sub is always below it then the series of a sub also has to converge but if the series of B suben diverges and the series of as suben is below it it tells us nothing Asen could diverge it could converge I don't know because it's not being forced anywhere this idea of the series of B ofen converges and A's below it the series of Asen is being forced somewhere it's being forced down and down and down and down and down if B were to diverge a would not be forced anywhere it could go either divergent or it could go convergent it would say nothing so fans you understand the idea okay what's it going to take what's it going to take to show that a series would be Divergent what would have to happen here to show Divergence has to be less than hang on two people talking go ahead will have a diverse to show that okay I'm going to State it as as subn being compared to B subn so let's say that uh let's say that right now B subn is going to converge if sorry um we already did conver did we let's talk about BN Di so let's say that b subn is going to diverge with a subn being below it does that show Divergence where would a a suben have to be in order for B sub to diverge and a suben must also follow suit and diverge it's got to be above it so that's our next case so if a subn is always bigger than or possibly equal to B subn for all n and the series of ban diverges well then the series of Bas event has to diverge here's this case it says all right so start off suppose that uh that for every single term here's B subn A subn is a little bit bigger here's B subn A subn is a little bit bigger here's B subn A subn is a little bit bigger so every single time well then a subn is not here anymore Ace subn says no no no I'm always just a little bit bigger now I'm up here term by term I'm a little bit bigger now suppose this suppose that the series of B subn is Divergent so this thing diverges if a subn is also a little bit bigger every single term if this thing adds to infinity or diverges or something you know the series adds to Infinity it's going to diverge and as's a little bit bigger where's the series of Asen going to go it's going to be bigger than that since it's term by term bigger if I add up all these these terms and it diverges then if I add up terms which are slightly larger than that it's also going to diverge so f understand that idea so now let's do this one let's say that bben converges if asen's a little bit bigger and bben converges what's it tell you about as suben nothing it says hey this one's bigger than that great bben converges okay what's tell about Asen nothing because asen's bigger it could converge I don't know it could diverge I don't know it's not being forced anywhere with B sub diverging it forces as suben to also diverge because a SP larger than that show pans feel okay with that idea would you like to try some examples you guys see the similarity in what we did between our sequences and this it's really similar it's just a series just had to make a a statement here so let's try a few examples are there any questions before we get going on and hopefully it's going to be pretty straightforward so let's try one let's really see if you're with it today by the way what's the first thing we should always check with series no matter what first thing what would ah we should always check that because it's going to be really quick so let's do the Divergence test does that diverge okay that's a horrible way to ask that question actually um are you certain that it might not divert that's a weird way to ask it does it pass the Divergence test so basically is the limit equal to zero if it wasn't equal to zero what would you know about this series for sure so it might not be diverent is basically what you know do we know it's convergent yet no no we don't know that but we know it might not be Divergent because the limit of our sequence from which our series is built equals zero as n approaches Infinity you okay with that one okay so we check that first nextly we go through a progression is it a p series no would that a p series yes okay you sure yes yes okay um say what now when p is greater than one when P would be greater than one so we know something about that but this is not now later on we're going to compare this is something very similar to that how about uh integral test could you do an integral test with this you actually could it'd be hard to do because that's not a perfect square but you could still do it you could do an integral test with that it's going to be some form of like a inverse okay if you if you were to do that not such a big deal you could do that is there an easier way to go about it yeah here's the easier way to go about it let's compare this to a series that we already know the convergence for so basically here's what we need to know first thing we need to say whether these terms are all positive are all these terms positive yeah okay so we know that because all these terms are positive this is greater than or equal to zero and now we're going to basee this on something that we already know the convergence for if we're trying to show listen if we're trying to show convergence you need to have this as less than something some Series where you know convergence for if you want to show Divergence you need to have this bigger than some series you know Divergence for it's silly to have something less than something divergent or bigger than something convergent that doesn't show you anything so what we're going to do is okay does that look like anything familiar and and you guys just said it you said it looks like a p series doesn't it yeah let's make this less than the P series is this true is that true for all n greater than one yes yeah well we know that when a denominator gets larger our fraction gets smaller so this fraction would always have to be less than this fraction you still okay with that one and this is true for yeah it's as a matter of fact it's true for all n but we only need it greater than equal to one so let's go back and see what this says um this says we're always going to have positive terms no matter what this says that well this is a true statement we're basing this on something we don't know the convergence for right here this is a piec that's fantastic well if that's a true statement then here's what the comparison test says it says well do you know that convergence for this yes yes okay let's go through it one time uh what's that called again P what's the P here two so we know that this is a p series p = 2 hey that's greater than one that's fantastic we know that if P were less than or equal to one we'd get the harmonic series or something below that and we' get something that would be di actually above that as far as sequences go we'd be Divergent so here we know hey it's a p series not a problem P equals 2 that's more than one therefore this series is what convergent now we're going to put the whole thing together put the whole thing together we start with some Series yeah you could do a couple other tests with this not a problem um can we do a comparison test well that depends are all your terms positive yes yeah it says right here you got to have positive terms so all our terms are positive no problem if is it less than a a series that you know is convergent that's what you ask now is it less than a series you know is convergent or is it bigger than a series you know is Divergent in our case I know that this thing is less than 1 n^2 it has to be that way because I'm just taking my denominator adding two between this fraction and this fraction between this sequence and this sequence or likewise our series and our Series so these are always going to be less than these terms for every single one term one term two it's always less than that if it's always less than our sequence we know is our series we know is convergent well then we got to look at that thing the series of 1 n^2 is a p series we know the p is equal to two that's more than one that shows convergence so what do we know about this series as well that also converges that also converges so our series of 1 n^2 + 2 also converges I want to make sure you guys really understand this before we go any further did that make sense to you show up hands if you did feel okay with that so basically what we're doing we're comparing one series to another uh we're comparing it to make it to show whether it's convergent or Divergent by saying well if it's below one series that converges our series converges if our series is above one series that diverges our series diverges as well that's the only two scenarios that we can really have there's only two cases have I explained this one well enough for you guys to get it can we move forward okay let's try a couple more let's give this one a try let's start from the very beginning with all of these series really go through the progression what's the first thing that we try anytime we get a series and we're trying to show convergence or Divergence what do we test first okay so we're going to take a limit of this thing uh does the limit of this thing equal zero yes if it didn't we'd stop right there if it does hey we're good to go let's continue with this thing so it says Hey the limit of the sequence goes to zero that means that potentially we could be possibly not Divergent we got to show that though we can't just stop right there it doesn't show convergence after that man we go through our our list of things to do um could we do integral test I don't know maybe but it's probably a little bit easier to do a comparison test right now here's why I see that um first I see are my terms positive all the time okay well that that's one condition we got to have that for comparison test so I know that we have all my terms are positive second thing I'm thinking about is this can I show that this is either greater than some series which is Divergent or less than some series which is convergent can I show that I don't know can you show that I can show that I know how to do it here's what I'm thinking I'm thinking that the one big the one thing about this is that three is kind of holding me back here does that make sense to you so the reason why the comparison test is so nice is if you haven't noticed this already it allows you to get rid of little pieces which are holding you back so you go hey that plus two that plus two hold me back man let's get rid of that well if I have a plus two in my denominator it's going to be less than one over whatever I have without that plus two does that make sense now here's the the little kicker for you what if it was a Min - two o greater than yeah that would be a problem because here that would be a minus two and that would be a greater than okay stick with me here I'm going back to this example now look we know that this series converges don't we but that series is bigger than that so this double inequality makes absolutely no sense says this is bigger than zero okay this is bigger than that so I can't use a squeeze THM if you're thinking squeeze THM right here because I don't have my double inequality set up the correct way this says all right those are positive terms fantastic but now this series is bigger than this one this one I'm sorry this one converges or or diverges conver tell me something about a series which is bigger than a convergent series does it tell us anything that would be a problem we'd have to do something different with that but if we have the plus man we're we're all set up we're good to get we're good to go in our case do we know that this is less than or equal to some series less than what you know I mentioned the squeeze theorem about 5 seconds ago do you guys see that essentially we can use a squeeze theorem here as well limit of 0 is0 limit of this thing is zero limit of this goes to zero that we could we actually did use that for sequences now the series a little bit different but basically the idea is about the same as far as comparing them so with comparison test we set it up all we have to do now is determine whether this thing converges or diverges let me let me make another point for you here if this were Divergent would it tell you anything about this no if this is convergent would it tell you anything about this so we want to see if this is convergent or not is it oh you got to show it to me you got to show me so let's talk about the series of one/ 2 the N tell me how that thing is converging tell me why and don't just say well if I take the limit it's zero you can't you can't do that isre say what now n is always increasing that's true explain that make the one the whole thing to the N power and then take out one okay so if I did this is that still true guys remember you're not trying to reinvent the wheel here right you're trying to base these on series that you already know the conversion for that's why I put at the very beginning base it on a geometric base it on on P series based it on harmonic series based it on one of those things does that make sense to you um you can do the integral test for some of these and that would work sure but it's easier if you based on things that we already have if you can do that quick head on if you're okay with this so far so we go okay cool well we we know that our terms are positive we know that our terms term by term this is going to be less than this one now this is great news for us because we know something about the series of 1 over two to the N the series of 1/ two to n the same as a series of2 to the N oh that's fantastic news why is that fantastic news what type of series is that now because it's geometric we can immediately determine whether this thing converges or diverges now um what I told you a long time ago few lessons ago was that this and this have to match now that's true if you need to find the sum does that make sense are we finding the sum of these series no so do I care not really I don't really care you can but notice that if I pull out a one2 to match my Powers if I pull out a 1/2 to match my Powers remember that whatever this is you have to match it 1 - one 2 - 2 3 - 3 if you were to find the sum because what remember what the sum of a geometric is it's a that's your first term over 1 - R I've already covered you can refresh your memory on that lesson uh as you want to but since we're not finding the sum it doesn't really matter as far as conversions goes the reason why it doesn't matter once you have this to a power I don't care how many of those factors you pull out that one half ain't changing does that make sense so all we're really looking at not really the a don't really care about it what I'm worried about is the r how much is the r absolute value of R is 12 that is less than remember that if we have the r absolute value of R less than one tell me something about that geometric series that's perfect so because this is a geometric series with r is less than one absolute value of R is less than one this thing is convergent or this converges um I'm hoping that you understand the reason why I'm not matching my powers do you do you understand why I'm not matching my powers we don't have to use trying to find the sum not trying to find the sum don't really care about it okay so let's refresh because on your test you are going to have to find the sum okay if you did have to find the sum would this be good enough no now you could do this remember I gave you a shortcut I said if you had to find the sum you just think about what your first term would be your first term would actually be if I plug in one your first term would be2 over 1 -2 does that make sense that's how you do it really fast no matter what that is even if they don't match it's your first term over 1us R not a big deal if they do match well you get to use your a it's a over 1us a is your first term always you can take your first term of 1us R it's not a big deal I covered it in a previous lesson you go back and check that now let's keep going with our our current problem so we start here we go cool positive less than 1/ 2 N that's a GE metric series that thing has an R of 1/2 Which is less than one it says that this series converges tell me something about the series that I'm given there why it's less very good the series we're given is less than or equal to some series that converges by the comparison test that means that this series also converges is it still making sense to you is it interesting to you it's similar to what we've done before I think it's kind of interesting kind of fun tell you what we'll try we'll do one more and we'll talk about something slightly different would you like to try one I'll give you about two minutes let's see if you can you can manage to to figure this one out if not no big deal so here's what I'm asking I'm asking you to firstly determine whether these terms are all positive you have to show that so the comparison test works when both of our series have positive terms so show me like this that our terms are always positive and make sure that you're right notice that this does not start at one this starts at three so show me that we have positive terms nextly determine what is going to work here whether this should be bigger than or smaller than a given series remember that if it's smaller than a given series that series must be convergent if it's bigger than another series that series that you're basing this on has to be Divergent so pick the correct one see if you can do it for tell me something are all the terms here positive yes did you see why we had to do n starts at three and not n starts at two or something if we said that n starts at two we'd have something undefined if we said n starts at one we'd have a negative and then something undefined so we said three so we get something that is positive so okay so yeah all the terms are positive now next up next up what is this going to be based on what's a good series for us to base this one on try to figure out whether it's diversion or conversion what is it do you remember me saying that when you have a constant like that that's the thing that's holding us back typically this is what's holding us back right here so we have 3 n/ 2 N - 4 and we have 3 n over 2 to the end check it out here's how you figured this thing out um would you be able to tell me convergence or Divergence for this guy okay cool uh specifically what would you be able to tell me it's diver okay so we're going to get to a diverent series right here now this one would have to be greater than or smaller than this one to show also diver so we got to figure it out is this bigger than this this is this way no no no heck no if I take a denominator and I subtract four from it it's going to make it bigger than my starting fraction so basically it says this fraction is always greater than this fraction my denominator is smaller therefore my fraction is larger sure be okay with that one are you sure okay do you guys see the point of trying to trying to do this or saying you know what this is always bigger than this series if I sometime possibly equal who cares so if this series if we can determine that this series diverges then we can show that this series diverges as well how am I supposed to write this series what should I do with it turn it into geometric yeah GE looks just like a geometric series that's great so we'd have 3es to the N power remember the idea is base your your given series on something that you already know the conversion for whether it's geometric whether it's a p series whether it's harmonic series one of the ones that we already know so for us we're saying man you know what this thing looks a whole lot like if I got rid of that constant it would look a whole lot like a geometric Series so let's get rid of the constant so if I get rid of the constant what that means is I'm basing that on something without my minus 4 well it's going to be bigger than 3 the N over 2 the N without the that's the idea since I know that this is geometric that's why I chose that one guys I'm not picking something out of a hat I'm picking something that looks really similar that I know the convergence for or Divergence for in our case I know that that's a geometric series with Ral 3 so we'd State this is geometric this has an R with the absolute value greater than one specifically we'd probably write it this way absolute value of Ral 3es that's greater than one tell me something about a geometric series when your R is greater than one in AB notice these are not arbitrary statements you you state it is geometric you state that the r is three Hales absolute value R is three halves it's bigger than one therefore this geometric series diverges Now is it going to be a problem that this doesn't match no no could you make it match yes you could you just pull out uh 3es to the 3 and you'd have 3 to the nus 3 not a problem why aren't we doing that this sum is not going to be the same as the sum it's saying that this is always bigger than that so I don't even really care what the sum is it's Divergent anyway why would I can't find the sum here so I'm not really concerned about the sum but if you're wondering why in the world are you not matching these up to an N minus 3 it's because the convergence or Divergence will not said this one time this is kind of an important note that you have down somewhere in your M Banks remember that convergence or Divergence will not change if I add or subtract a finite number of terms do you remember that the convergence or Divergence will not change if I add or subtract a finite number of terms the sum will change yes the Ser the sum will change but not the convergence or the Divergence so basically this right here look at the board please this right here has the same convergence or Divergence as this does it has to cuz all I'm doing is adding to it three terms or from here to here all I'm doing is subtracting from it three terms does that make sense therefore if this one conver this one diverges I'm subtracting three terms this one also has to diverge don't care that I can't find the sum we're not worried about that anyway we're not finding the sum here what we're doing is finding out convergence or Divergence now let's go one step further so because we know that my series is bigger than a given series for which I know Divergence tell me something about my given series and that's exactly how I want you to write it I want you to start with a given series I want you to base on something you know convergence or Divergence for typically you kind of have an idea in your mind hopefully you do before you start this like for here I'm thinking you know what uh if I cover that up that's going to be oh that looks like a that looks like a geometric to me with Ral 1/2 if I cover this up man that looks like a geometric with Ral 3es so I'm saying okay I'm going to try to make this smaller than a series that converges I did it looks like a geometric it's smaller than a geometric that converges therefore my series converges okay this one it's bigger than a geometric that diverges therefore my series also has to diverge this is the case where as subn is smaller than B suben it's forcing it to converge this is the case where as suben is bigger than B suben it's forcing it to divert Jo I explain this well enough for you guys questions oh um could we just skipped all this work we did the limit test limit comparison test yeah we're going to in a minute what do you mean limit it's like the diver Li that original thing yeah you could have but you didn't stop me you should have but you didn't thought you trying to make a point so I am making a point I did make a point uh but if you if you do the first thing you should always do is what I've said that every problem except for this problem right because I was making a point uh but if you did that well you have a fraction that's bigger than one raised to the infinity it's going to go to Infinity it's not going to go to zero this would fail the difference test it would not equal zero it would be diverent does that make sense okay stop right there good catch let's try one more uh any other questions before we continue you guys are awfully quiet today to blew my mind honestly this one the liit little comment di after I let it soak in oh yeah now doing this appropriately would take a little work because you can't just start with three to the N over over 2 the N minus without the minus 4 so you'd probably have to do the lals and say this is infinity over infinity to get rid of that four so you have ln3 3 the N over ln2 2 * 2 N then you do it uh then you go ahead and say that's a constant so pull out the ln3 over ln2 have a limit as n approaches Infinity of 3S to the n and then we think okay this is a fraction that's greater than one true fraction greater than one being raised to Infinity power that's going to grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow this equals infinity therefore this does not equal zero Divergence that's what you were talking about right and you could also show it that way so this was this was a twer we we could do Divergence test and it fails it hey cool no problem it's not equal to zero therefore serious Divergence or you can show it this way honestly for me they're about the same level of difficulty but you should be checking the Divergence test first that was a great point soens if you understood both of these good deal okay now we'll do one more more one more one more one more well that wasn't one more that was the same one so one [Applause] more okay I'm going to go kind of quickly through this one kind of quickly through this one so first thing are all of our terms positive yes no yes cool now what's the problem on our series that we can't can't do what we want to do what's our problem the plus one the plus one's a problem so let's base this on a series without the plus one cuz I don't want the plus one the plus one is the problem is this series greater than this series or is our given series less than our series that we just made less than less than for sure less than so far so good okay now here's the issue if I do the series of 1 to Infinity of one over theun n do you understand that that's the series from 1 to Infinity of 1 n 12 power tell me something about that Ser P series very good what's the p that's less than or equal to one tell me something about a p Series where the p is less than or equal to one now let's go back to our original series we have a p Series right here where the p is less than or equal to one this this series diverged right uhhuh what's it tell you about my given series crap why not this is the this is the time where you have B to the n and you have a to the n and I say hey look at this uh B to the N diverges what do about this one I don't know it could converge it could diverge I don't know because it's not being forced anywhere that's this that's this guy okay that's don't be this guy well this is the only thing that we could do I mean we can't make this smaller than a series that converg just we don't know what that is we don't know what's going to it's going to be we don't know anything about this the only thing that we could do is BAS it on this immediate one this one that says okay we know for a fact that this is less than u 1 over theare root of n we know that for sure but we know this thing diverges if that diverges and our series is less than this one it's inconclusive it's not a good test for us it the only thing we could do but it wasn't a good test now the point is we don't just stop here we have something else that we could do the other type by the way we didn't test this but hopefully you did this in your head could you do the Divergence test with this limit of this guy is zero so we know we should have moved forward with it unlike the last example so if ever we can't just use a basic comparison test like the ones we had what we had works great if your series is less than something convergent or more than something Divergent does that make sense if we're less than something divergent or more than something convergent it doesn't make any sense to do that we have another test for that we're going to talk about what's called The Limit comparison test here's the idea for the limit comparison test if the series of a subn and the series of B subn have all positive terms and and here's the big part okay so positive terms uh we had that from before right that's for any of these comparison tests they have to both have positive terms and the limit of A subn over B subn exists not exits sorry exits leaves the room it just gives up he exists and here's what we know then either both series converge or both series diverge they're tied together so closely that one is a predictor of the other and that's what the limit comparison test says um you could probably think of it this way you think okay well if this exists think about this think about this if this limit exists this is a ratio right of one series one the terms of one series over the terms of another if the limit exists at some point as n approach Infinity that means that those terms are so close together that it doesn't really matter does that make sense to you if they're so different that it does matter that thing's going to go to infinity or negative Infinity probably Infinity because they're all positive terms um but that thing would go to Infinity they would be so different does that make sense to you so we say Okay cool so if this limit exists then either both series converge or both series diage so again I'm not gonna write this down it's the same idea so we're going to compare our given series to a series that we know the convergence of and then we're going to take a limit that's the idea would you like a proof of this to prove that this is actually true yeah okay so here's the proof um let's suppose that this limit exists if this limit exists then the limit as n approach Infinity of a A subn over B subn would be equal to some limit True by definition of what a limit is what this means is that absolute value of A subn over B subn minus L would be less than Epsilon remember those Epsilon Delta proofs you loved them right woo that's what a limit that's a definition of limit it means that the different it's a very simple idea it looks really confusing it's a very simple idea it means that if this limit exists then the difference between those this fraction well whatever your function is between this function and your limit the difference between those and absolute value is less than whatever you say I can make it smaller that's what it means so you give me 01 I can show that this difference is smaller than that that's what the definition of limit is it says the difference between them is so negligible it doesn't matter what it is even if you give me Epsilon a really little number does that make sense are you sure okay so this is by definition is true so if this is true then for certain I can multiply by L and it's still true since L's a number it's it's still true well we're going to use that because we have an absolute value inequality we should know that we can solve this inequal well we can manipulate this inequality by doing negative absolute value negative sorry Epsilon that's absolute value negative Epsilon L is less than a subn / B subn minus L Which is less than Epsilon L well that would have to be true that's how absolute values work absolute value equalities work this way you go okay well I make that negative this is bigger than that if I leave it positive this is smaller than that is it now double inequality we're just going to solve for this so what we're going to do is we're going to add L to both sides if I add L to both sides I get lus Epsilon L is less a subn b subn Which is less than L plus Epsilon L almost done last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to factor and I'm going to multiply by B subn so we factor out the L no problems oneus e 1us Epsilon factor of L it's 1 plus Epsilon multip by B subn on all three sides by the way we can do that because B subn is what type of a number what type of terms they're positive it's not going to change my inequality so this is all based on that this the B sub has to be positive terms so we can do that does not change inequality now have you understand that that idea yeah okay so it's positive we're all good as far as inequality is concerned well here's the idea here's where this comes in do you understand that that's a constant e Epsilon is going to be some number right add one to it's still some number multiply by L it's still some number so the convergence of B subn is not affected by what this is likewise the convergence of B subn is not affected by what this is so think about this and this proves both of them this kind of cool if the series B suben converges if the series B sub converges as suben is less than that series do you see that okay you're not you're not really with me huh are you with me yes kind of sort of do you see the the comparison test out of this right now if bben converges asben is less than that if bben diverges as subn is bigger than that so just based on whatever we're we're looking at if B sub converges no problem as sub converges if B sub diverges a sub also diverges that's the idea if you understand idea that proves this guy that proves this uh this theorem here so I'll write that real quick and we'll be done if B subn converges since a subn is less than that and this does not by the way this does this is a constant it's not going to affect the convergence of our series it' just be our series multipli by whatever that constant is if B sub then diverges asent also diverges now of course I haven't done an example with this but we're going to do that last example I had with our limit comparison test so here's the the whole kind of put everything together a moment for you the first thing we start with all the time first thing we start with all the time is what liit di just take a limit if it doesn't equal zero you're done it diverges after that start thinking about easy stuff okay is it a geometric if it's geometric do it goodness six is it a p series is it harmonic if it's not one of those things then we start talking about okay well can I do an integral test with it maybe I can if it's positive continuous decreasing integral test Works real nice if it's not one of those things or it's maybe it's easier to do this you go okay well at this point I think well now with the comparison test is this always smaller than a series that is convergent or is my given series bigger than a series that's Divergent if it is man we're done if that's not the case if you go man now I have something that's smaller than divergent or bigger than convergent I can't really use the comparison to test straight up then what we do is we go well maybe a limit comparison test would work we'll say this one's so close to the other one so close that I'll take a limit of the ratio of them if I take the limit of the ratio of my series then if that limit exists my result will be the same for both my series they will both converge or they will both diverge does that make sense to you question with these tools can we do any or there some there just they can do anything no there's other things other techniques I'm going to show you you can do a lot with them I'll put it that way okay all right so let's wrap up this example so what we learned was that often times we can't use the comparison test just like it is for instance when we did when we tried the comparison test with this particular series we said sure the terms are positive that's fine sure it's less than 1 over the of n however because 1 the thir of end that series diverges and it's bigger than the given series that we want to show convergence or Divergence for that doesn't do us a whole bit of good because well if this is bigger than the series and this diverges it's not forcing this one to do anything therefore the comparison test by itself won't really work we need something that if we have our given series smaller than a series that converges that's good or bigger than a series that diverges that's good but smaller than a series that diverges doesn't do us anything so we invented this new thing we said all right well if the comparison test doesn't just straight up work let's try the limit comparison test so we said all right no problem let's compare these Series in a ratio no problem just some sort of fraction here and let's take the limit as n approaches Infinity if that limit exists what that means is that these series are so close together that the ratio exists to some number they're so close together that if one converges the other one's tied to it and if one diverges the other one's tied to it so basically what we do is We compare a given series compare a given series to one that we know the convergence or Divergence for and take a limit of it it's not a straight up comparison test is saying it's always less than or greater than because that won't work in this case but if we take the limit and we say all right tell you what by the way a is a subn is always your given series always what you start with b suban is always something you're trying to base your series on that you know the convergence orever 4 so we say all right our a subn here is 1 the < TK n + 1 over something that looks a whole lot like our series that we know the convergence or Divergence for so namely we'd say all right well let's compare it to the one over the square of n this thing's going to behave a lot like this that's where we're getting this from are you guys okay with this so far show hands if you are so it's it's looking just like this right only we're not doing a comparison test as it's always less than or greater than we're do a comparison test as far as the limits concerned that's why it's called a limit comparison test taking the limit of this comparison so far so good do you know how to do limits mhm of course you do so we just make this thing simpler since we have a complex fraction here let's make this we reciprocate and multiply 1 over the < TK n + 1 excuse me thank you time of one n over one all right well that's going to give us a limit as n approaches Infinity of theun n over the < TK of n + 1 tell me something about that what's the limit infity okay tell me what you could do you could if you wanted to uh now notice that you have the same thing of the same thing right so that that might be an issue for you I don't know uh maybe something a little bit easier something that we think can't split this one up because our denominator can't be split up so we can't do that what we could do is maybe just divide by the largest power of the denominator which is what we typically do with these things anyway so if we do divide by largest power in the denominator I think Frank said that in the back if we divide we're going to get the of n over the of n that's one we're going to get theare of n over the of n that's one we're going to get 1 over the < TK n and that saves us a whole lot of time we don't have to worry about ly tall's rules so don't skip some of the easy stuff when you're doing these limits um often times it's a lot easier to just divide by the largest power in the denominator if you have something that's rational like a rational expression or even square roots things like this almost like pols you guys okay with that so far so tell me what the limit is what's the limit of one what's the limit of one what's the limit of one over the of n is am how much is this limit okay now please listen carefully here's what this whole thing means what it means is that these two things were so close together that our limit existed it also means they're so close together that if one converges the other one has to converge and if one diverges the other one has to divert so please do not make the mistake of doing this do not make the mistake of saying hey the limit exists therefore it converges that is not what we're talking about we're talking about in the limit comparison test is since the limit exists they will both have the same result they'll both be convergent or they'll both be Divergent that is why you compare your given series to one that you already know the convergence or Divergence for you say hey you know what I know this one what is that is that convergent or Divergent diver that's Divergent why P ser very good and the p is so it's a p series of P less than one true that's Divergent so what this says is this doesn't mean it's convergent this means that this thing is going to have the same result as what you're basing on that's what it says so if the limit exists we go okay well since the limit exists since they both have positive terms which they both do we already checked that earlier here since the limit exists and the series of 1 < TK n diverges the series from one to Infinity of 1 the n + 1 tell me something about that one then diver also Divergence so we say all right the limit exists they're tied together so closely that they're going to have the same result either both converge or both diverge a limit existing here for the limit comparison test does not automatically mean convergent that's not what it means what it means is that whatever your series is and whatever series you're basing that on both converge or they both diverge if you know one of them diverges because this is a p series with P = 12 then you know this one also Di just because that limit existed of that ratio question um I'm kind of confused when we do limits and say we had a 1/x^2 took the limit as an approach or X approached Infinity um we say that that's zero right true but then we do like series and it's like a p series like that we say that it converges the P series does converge but does it just converge to like five or something or something like that where it would the infinity anyways I don't well the P series converges but a series is different than just a straight up limit now we check a straightup limit on the series just to see that the sequence is going to converge so try not to get confused with sequence versus series okay what we do immediately with the with the Divergence test is say hey look at your look at your sequence of numbers this is the Divergence test does your sequence go to zero yes it does that means that ultimately for a series what we're adding up are values that are zero now the series itself is not going to go to zero the series itself is going to add up a number of terms I don't know what that's going to add to in a lot of these things I do if it's geometric because we can find the sum of that okay but I don't know what that's going to be so when we're taking a limit here we're not actually finding a sum we're not actually finding out whether it's equal to zero or not we're not actually finding out basically anything besides these things are really closely tied together that's what the limit comparison test does it says these things are really closely tied together does the limit have to equal zero for this to work no no it just says that it has to exist it's got to it can't be Infinity can't be does not exist okay it's got to exist to be a number if it's zero cool if it's one cool I don't care what it is as long as it's a finite number that means these are tied together and the the Divergence or convergence will be the same between our two series now when we're taking um a limit of a of a series like uh like when we did the limit of this one again what you're just saying there is the Divergence test says the sequence from which your series is built has to go to zero because ultimately you got to add up terms that are close to zero for it to make no difference does that make sense if we would have had something like n over the of n we' add up terms that ultimately would lead us to Infinity that means that our series would go towards Infinity as well and we would not be able to add that together we' not be able to find a series that converges so convergence for a series just means that ultimately you're going to be adding up terms that are zero so ultimately you'll come up with a sum that is not Infinity that is an actual finite number did that clear something up for you yeah okay it's it's I know it's a little confusing because we talked about sequences right and now we're talking about sequences kind of but we're adding the terms together so some of the things are are along the same line and now I'm bringing up limits again and saying yeah the limit does have to equal zero doesn't and it doesn't mean that if the limit exists we're getting convergence doesn't mean that if the limit exists we're getting Divergence you have to read the problem you say hey this thing if it exists these two series will have the same outcome whether one's Divergent other's Divergent where one's convergent the other's convergent so it's a little different idea we're using a limit here not to show convergence or Divergence we're using a limit here to show that they have the same convergence or Divergence and I proved that that theorem last time okay anyway uh I'm going to move on here a little bit I'd like to get a couple more examples out of it see if we can do this one are there any further questions that was a good question thank you for that one any other questions before move on did this make sense to most of you did this make sense to all of you how many people did it make sense for feel okay with that one ify are we okay question so just to further clarify if this limit were to coach infinity or some um abstract number like that then um then you can't say a thing about it then okay we just you might try maybe a different series okay okay now for us usually we're going to pick them so that they're really close um I'm going to show you how to do that right now so maybe this will clear up your question question okay one and then two uh so a subn is the one that's given and B subn is the the one that you're using right always okay you want us answer it like that with the like sentence I would love it if you guys would answer it like that I'm guessing some of you won't but I would love it if you answer it just like that because that is literally what the the answer is it's saying because the limit exists because the series here diverges because it's a p series you have to state things like this okay you can't just say diverges you got to State why you got to show me your thinking here much of this is not going to be just math work much of it is thinking reasoning like well this is a diver series because it's a p series P equals one2 okay cool how's that relate to what we're doing well because the limit exists it says that they're going to have the same result they're both going to be convergent or Divergent one since one was Divergent the other has to be that's the idea any other questions those are all good let me show you another one last chance I waited this time I was nice and you go ah man what are we going to do here well listen we don't have to have a series that's exactly the same that's not the idea here we have to have a series that behaves kind of like this one that we know the convergence for so here's what we do when we're coming up with these especially when you have something that's rational or kind of semi-rational you have almost pols or square roots of polinomial listen do you guys know anything about limits as Intero Infinity do you know that with polinomial the limit is dictated by the behavior of your very first your leading coefficient your leading term I'm sorry your leading term did you know that so the think of the end behaviors of this of these functions so the end behavior of this function I don't even care what that is the end behavior is going to look a lot like 2 over n^2 does that make sense the end behavior of this does that three really matter as far as the end behavior goes no this is a whole lot like the square root of 4 n 7 that's really what we have there that's the end behavior so when we're doing these we're going to compare this to this one why well this is going to act really similar as n approaches Infinity now are all the terms going to be the same no but as we get towards Infinity these terms are going to be really close to that one so the end behaviors will be very close so what I want you to do is think of and behaviors basically with pols that's really easy because that's just the leading term that's what a that's what a limit is it's n approach infinity or X approach Infinity is just the leading term term with the largest power that was it so um let's be kind of nice about this can you simplify that hey that's why this thing's going to be nice because if we simplify this we will find out what the convergence or Divergence is of it so let's do it um how do I simplify it say what pull the four out and then pull the four okay so 2 n^2 over 2 N 7 Hales we could do that can I keep going how much is it two is gone yeah okay that's good news what about n^2 n to the 7es can you do that 1 let's see this would be 4 - 7es that's n the -3 or we get 1/ n the 3es yes we get 1 over n 3es you guys okay with this so far yes are you sure you should be cuz that's freaking just some algebra and you should be okay with it now tell me something about this series tell me something about that series it's a p series what's the P so this is p series with a p equals to 3es greater than tell me something about a p series with a p equal 3es greater than one what do you know that's convergent P series beautiful now let's think about what the limit comparison test is going to do for us here so we probably already would have done the Divergence test hopefully you would have done that now the limit of the sequence here without the series The Limit would be zero we're good to go it says we might not be Divergent then we go ahead and we think well is it a straight up P series is it geometric is it any of these things that we can do is it integral test um is it a comparison test I don't know looks pretty hard for comp comparison test can I do a limit comparison test yeah yeah think of the end behaviors end behavior would look like this guy this guy is a convergent P Series so what we're going to do now now that we've determined that this is a convergent P series or even if it was a Divergent P series We compare this as a limit as n approaches Infinity uh what's going to go on the numerator of this Rao the original one the original one very good we put so the original series that's our a sub then over what the end say what now one over the n n the n one so this one you could even use this one whatever you want now that's fine I don't think it really matters uh what which one you use we doing Bas I'd use that one because it's nicer basically and you can do these a couple ways okay basically what I like to do I like to find out what I'm going to compare my original series to I like to simplify that as much as I can because they all should be simplified because basically you're getting rid of everything but the leading terms did that SN in that means they're all going to simplify hello you're getting rid of everything but the leading terms should be just one term over one term you simplify that I like to find out whether it's going to converge or diverge first I like to have that in the back of my mind then I like to compare it with the simplest form that should make sense right that way I don't have to re simplify in my problem well this is a whole lot easier to deal with than that one is isn't it so why would I put that back back in I'm going to use my simple tell me the next step what would you do simplify multiply by reciprocal we could do that are you starting to notice all the algebra you're going to do so we'll have 2 n^2 + n over the square < TK of 4 n 7 + 3 * n 3 over one now I'm going to move over here what now yeah okay we can do that two and to the what no mind you guys are going to make me start drinking aren't you sorry I drink guys just I want to punch more papers we just pull more ins out I think that's what we end doing any s yeah seven spot you guys figured out me you better figure out okay last time I checked yeah last time I checked it was it was seven Hales damn do you know what you do when you multiply common bases you add plus how much over nasty square root don't do a l TS rule don't that just divide by the largest power in the denominator so if you divide by the largest power in the denominator here's how you figure that out you cover up all but the leading term that would be the largest power so cover up all that that thing and write that as a power so we're going to divide by by what divide by n 7 so we're going to divide by n to the 7es Over N to the 7es works out I want you to understand that these are equivalent do you understand that they equivalent one we've written as uh rational exponents one we have as radicals now please listen carefully you don't always get to do this just like it is you have to verify that your radican the inside part is actually positive because this is positive we can make that straight up move does that make sense to you so that we're we're good to go so if we divide this we're going to have a limit as n approaches Infinity of 2 N 7 over n 7 I'm show you every step here plus n the 5es Over N the 7es all over big square root because that has a square root that has a square root we'd have 4 n the 7th Over N 7 + 3 over N 7th I want to make sure that you guys understand that we are not multiplying here we're dividing we're dividing by each of these terms okay so it's getting divided it's getting divided that's why we have this over into the 7 Hales and over into the 7es and over end the 7th because we have two square roots here we can make that one large square root over end the 7th and over end of the 7th show you okay with the AL over there let's simplify it so we have a limit and n approaches Infinity how much does this give you two plus 1 over what Z over this would be square root of 4 + 3 n 7 can we take the limit now now that we got rid of all that stuff what would you get what's the limit of two as n infity what's the limit of this as apprach infity that goes zero how about the limit of this one how about the limit of this one what's 2 over the < TK of 4 what's that tell you the limit exists the limit exists that's what it tells you says the limit exists which means that going back here it says that what we have and what we compared it to will have the same result if this one's convergent the one we're given is convergent if this one's Divergent the one we're given is Divergent does this always tell you convergent or Divergent no no the first example we had it existed yet it gave us Divergent now we have limit existed yet it's going to give us so the way we write this is limit exists since the limit exists and the series of 1 n 3 as n = 1 to Infinity converges then we have the series from one to Infinity of our nasty junk also converges that's the idea do you understand the idea show F if you do you feel okay with this stuff easy medium hard different probably little different it'll get easier the problem with all this stuff is that there's so much stuff that's the problem with this it's because some of this will get confused in your heads and some of you will will think back to the comparison test for sequences forget about the limit comparison test here some of you will get confused with the Divergence test taking a limit of uh sequence here saying equal to zero and automatically think it converges some of you will think well since this doesn't equal zero it must diverge that's not what we're doing you need to get the test straight I know it's new and there's a lot to it there's a lot of stuff that we're doing so I'm going to try my best to reinforce the ideas here the ideas are you start with a Divergence test and you take a limit of this sequence from which your series is built if it does not equal zero you stop right there your series is Divergent does that make sense after that you keep going with one of the meth methods that i' I've used so far geometric P series integral test comparison test limit comparison test there's several now we do a limit comparison test but you understand with a limit comparison test that if you equal any number besides infinity or does not exist that means the results are tied together both converge or both diverge not necessarily one of the other Okie doie would you like to try one more one more okay one more any questions before I raise it are they kind of fun though kind of fun right I enjoy them it's totally different than doing all those integral stuff in it kind of like a puzzle you just got to get creative with picking a new Bea then that's why it's kind of like a puzzle it can be puzzling especially with this one let's start from the beginning first thing what uh what was you do first you do it let's pretend that we did it okay but you want to start there let's pretend we did it diverence test it equals z what should you do going or stop it equals zero going equals zero what would you do stop keep going okay what would you check here would you want to do integral test no can you do the integral of that thing probably not a good idea uh does it look like p no look like a geometric series no look like something we could compare it to yeah but not a real easy one huh cuz I don't know that that's always less than something are always greater than something so if it's not something easy like that like we had with a couple of them that were nice we go well maybe we want to try to limit comparison test so let's try to see if this is if this compares to something so this compares to what can just get rid of an L well here's the thing you're going to get rid of part of it right but you you need to keep the fastest growing part first I you know I've been skipping a couple things you need to make sure that this has positive terms and I'm kind of taking that for granted that's not a trivial point you do have to make sure it has positive terms does this have positive terms as long as n is greater than one yes it does because n between zero and one here would be negative terms maybe well actually I would for for here so we do have positive terms that we need to check it now if you're going to talk about end behaviors that's what I told you right and behaviors of this one that's going to be pretty easy what goes on our denominator yeah that's fast piece of cake end behaviors of this one can get a little tricky what you want to do you want to keep the fastest growing part the fastest growing part will give you the end behavior does that make sense to you that's why we keep the largest uh Power that that leading term because that's giv us our end behavior it's the fastest growing or fastest falling apart well in our case what grows faster square of n or Ln L better I don't know many of you are guessing right now youch it into your and look at the gra they're very similar square root of n decreasing as it gets larger L get bigger untrue they both increase put some high number in both put some huge number in both of them that'll prove everything that's a great idea uh well you could think of it as Ln of n is an inverse of e to x correct so if e x starts climbing real fast Ln is going to climb but slower and slower slower less of a pace than Square Ro of n square root of n is the faster increasing one now how do you show that here say show maybe you consider FX = s < TK X and F ofx sorry G maybe G of X I don't get confused on that g ofx = Ln X the derivative is 1x the derivative is 1 / 2 x you can verify that later if you want now here's the whole point this is kind of interesting to think about hopefully hope you're with me on this one you guys okay on the derivatives right derivatives tell how you're increasing in this case how you're they're both increasing graphs tells how you're increasing so whichever one goes to zero whichever derivative goes to zero faster that's the one that stops increasing sooner I'll say that one more time so it makes sense okay this is how your functions are increasing are you with me they're both they both they're both positive with n greater or X greater than one so this is how they're increasing whichever since this shows how your graphs are increasing or your functions are increasing whichever one goes to zero faster is the one that stops increasing sooner did that sink in which one goes to zero faster this one does that goes to zero faster so this goes to zero faster than this therefore F ofx increases faster than G of X at the end it will in you can think of it as increasing longer increasing faster this is the Bas basic idea does that make a little bit of sense to you it's kind of weird right you're using a derivative to say well which one goes to zero faster which one uh slows its increasing Behavior faster since this goes to zero faster this slows its increasing Behavior faster than this one does that's the idea this will always be increasing at a faster rate than this one does that make sense to you okay don't just plug in numbers please I'm paying uh pluging de I don't know no don't do that okay actually go through the math here so what are we going to pick for this one again is going to be Ln of n or square root of n square root of n yeah it's going to be square root of n because this one is going to be the end behav the model for end behavior since this increases faster than this one end behavior we use that now can you simplify it definitely if you have only one term over one term you better be able to simplify these things let's simplify what is it 2 so one over don't leave me hanging huh one over n the 3es exactly what that is does that make sense to you we have square of n that's n the2 12us 2 is3 we'd have one over n 3es tell me something about that Series so we're talking about this comparison to the series I'm kind of admitting that but this is what we're doing this is what now same as last it's exact same thing it's a p series I love P series me too I really do they're so easy P series P = 3es greater than 1 tell me something about this particular P series which we are comparing our given series to brilliant so tell me this if we compare this to this and the limit exists what do we know about that it also conver it also converges very good what if limit doesn't exist done can't do it so let's do our limit comparison test so we start off with the limit as n approaches Infinity of what goes on our numerator please that's going to be nasty N2 + one all over what over what yeah that's right and then we start working with it this is a limit as n approaches Infinity of < TK n plus Ln of n over n^2 + 1 that's a lot of n dang n 3es over 1 that is a lot that is a lot from there what would we do distrib let's distribute so if we distribute this we get a limit as n approaches Infinity of of if this is a one power you'd have two Hales plus three halves it would be five halves but this is a 1/2 Power one2 Plus 3es is that's n 2 plus n the 3 Ln was right n over n^2 + 1 goodness gracious me that's a lot of stuff going on what's the next thing that you might want to consider doing would you try like a ly talls right now or something is that a good idea no you get that plus right there that's not a good idea because this would be infinity plus infinity we don't know what that is okay it's got to be indeterminate form for you to do a ly TOS now I'll give you caveat to that that you can do L talls on individual portions of this because you could split up parts of your limit you could do that do that a minute so what would you do so let's divide by N2 everywh so this is a limit as n approaches Infinity of N2 / n 2 yeah I'm going to write it out plus n 3 Ln n/ n 2 all over n^2 n^2 + 1 n^2 just so we see where everything's coming from limit as n approaches Infinity oh goodness uh what's become what's this one plus Ln of n Over N 12 exactly this is one this is 1 over n to the 2 can I have a show of hands if you feel okay getting down that far on your own on your own okay what's the limit of one one what's the limit of one what's the Lim of 1 nity so this is going to zero what about that one it's an indeterminate form why is it an indeterminant form infinity infinity brilliant exactly right so off to the side that you can do this it's okay here's why you can do it you can separate this limit by addition we can do a limit as n approaches Infinity of Ln n/ n^ 12 this thing equals infinity over infinity so we'll do oh what are you going to do with infinity over infinity again love ly tall he's much better than L short joking um that was a horrible joke I get my sense of hum from my dad love you dad I don't know if he watches these he should he really should give him something to do besides working on this never mind don't watch that Dad so uh what's a derivative of lnn derivative of n that looks sloppy doesn't it n the one2 what's the Der of n the 1 okay one two okay let's do that yeah one over two s of n if my math serves me correctly I don't think so is it a negative no no it's not I don't think so cuz you bring in the one2 you take one away from the exponent becomes negative that's a negative exponent that goes to the denominator so 2un of n let's go ahead and let's reciprocate and multiply so we have if we reciprocate and we multiply we're going to have what is that [Music] any reciprocate and multiply so far so good y okay well yes but be smarter about this okay I should have taught you something I know that I did before you start doing lals rules again and again and again and again and again simplify simplify this thing before you go any further because right now you're going to be done oh yeah so don't just arbitrarily jump into a lalls before you simplify we should have learned that a long time ago when it said with lyall's rule before you do it again you must simplify the fraction and that goes without saying hopefully for you so with us this is going to be 2 over the n yes no tell me something about the limit as n appr infinity of 2 of n what is it okay so now we know this thing is zero so we have a limit as n approaches Infinity actually we let it I'm sorry we let it approach Infinity what's this limit going to equal we have 1 + 0 over 1+ 0 how much is so our limit equals one come out I can't say that no I don't know just depends just coincidence so what so um the limit of that is one over one because that in determin form approach is zero right you know I'm going to go out there on a limit say yeah they probably do because if you're talking about end behaviors and you're saying they're very close you have basically the something over the same thing so a lot of them should work out to one what's the next statement that you're going to make do you know that next statement you're going to make since the limit exists since the limit exists so write that down since the limit exists andies of is convergent because is greater than one very good then what do you know about our given series it also converges that's exactly what we should write so word for word since the limit exists and the series of 1/ n the 3es is convergent by P series p is 3 greater than 1 then and this is the only part I'm going to write because I'm R room then the series that we were given also converges I should be a period also converges here's what I'm wondering um does a limit comparison test make sense to you it's kind of a cool thing isn't it it's saying use the N Behavior make a limit out of it it's just a ratio saying if the N behaviors are very similar make a ratio if that limit exists then sure enough they're both going to be convergent or both Divergent because they model after the same curves basically at the end beh here this that's the idea so we have a number of things now and the here's the wrap up the number of things first thing you always check for is yeah always take a limit of the sequence from which your series is stemming okay just the terms if it equals zero you must keep going if it doesn't equal zero you're done because that whole thing is Divergent okay after that check for the easy ones don't make this stuff harder than it is I would automatically check for geometric maybe I can make it uh I would automatically check for p series I mean that'd be a piece of cake that'd be kind of nice after that I check for if it's an easy integral I do integral test if I can do that or we could do now a comparison test like an easy comparison test would be kind of cool to do because there's less than something that's sometimes really easy to do if that's not the case we got to do a limit comparison test so for some of these nasty looking ones limit comparison test is the way to go if if you can show what the N behaviors are appropriately so for us remember that was this whole piece right here saying well we want to stick with the square root of N and not Ln of n because that is really the end behavior of that function does that make sense that's the numerator our sequence as it work after that it's pretty straightforward if the limit exists you're good to go whatever series you base this on compared it to that's going to be the also the uh the result of your given series whether it's convergent or Divergent 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 9.5:  Showing Convergence With the Alternating Series Test, Finding Error of Sums
so let's get started on the alternating series test of course alternating series test is going to work for what type of series alternating series yes obviously so here's what a alternating series looks like what what it means an alternating series is simply a series where sequential terms alternating alternate signs so positive negative positive negative positive negative positive netive that's what gives it this alternating so it's a series where sequential terms alternate signs no problem let me give you an example of what alternating series typically look like and then I'll show show you what the alternating series test is so first uh you have seen a couple of these before they were very common in our our sequences actually now that we have a series we're not just going to be alternating the signs but we're going to be adding them together so we had alternating sequences we didn't really call them a name or anything but here uh alternating series well that's a specific section for us so here's what they look like typically there'll be some series like this one ah it's a horrible end some series like this one and there will be something in it that makes the signs alternate do you remember what we had that made the signs of our sequences alterative one that's right to some power yeah negative 1 to some power that was based on N so for us it's typically n minus one we usually not all the time we usually start with a positive term so we usually start with like uh when I plug in one I would get zero right remember how that matches typically that's going to give us netive one to zero or one so we get a positive term to start with that's normally how it happens this is your first experience with an alternating series so unlike the SE where we just list them the series is just going to add these things up so here's what it would look like what's the very first term don't at one one one yeah if you plugged in one you're going to get one over one it's going to be positive you get one would I add or subtract the next term sub subract because I plug in if I plug in two what's 2 - 1 what's 1 to the 1 1 so I'd have minus 12 so whereas a sequence would just go one NE then comma 1/2 then comma positive 1/3 then comma 1/4 what a series does it goes okay 1 - 12 + 1/3 - 1 1/4 plus 1 are you guys getting the picture here so the next one would be positive or plus 1/3 minus or /4 +5 minus and it doesn't end that's the way your alternating series will look you okay with that yeah now what's quite interesting is that this thing this thing any of these alternating series that do this they can always be written as -1 to the nus1 * some other Series where the a sub n is something that that uh is always positive so for instance the only thing that's giving this the sign change is at1 to the N minus one you guys agree with that yeah other than that the 1/ N the 1/ N is the a subn that we're talking about so in our case like more specifically this could be written as as the alternating part okay this1 nus1 * 1/ n this would be our specific thing here uh by the way what type of series is that p no yeah kind of it is it's a specific type of P series I'm sorry I said no but you're right it's a p series with P equals 1 but we had a specific name for what was it that's a harmonic Series so if that's the harmonic Series this is simply the alternating harmonic series and that's literally exactly what that is that's the here look it if that was a one that'd be har that'd be the harmonic series if I do this it's now just the alternating harmonic series does it look familiar to you it's alternating harmonic series that's what it is my point is that with any of these alternating series you can always do this you can always break off the negative one to your power and have some other a subn some other sequence that it's positive terms so F if you feel okay with that so far let me give you one more example so right now we're not really working with them we're just kind of getting the picture of what these things are like that one let's figure out a few terms here let's figure out a few terms there so what part of this is going to make our signs change what part if I cover that up do I have positive terms still absolutely I do so that's kind of interesting right so alternating series we can break off that one part that makes it negative we're going to have these positive terms so let's figure out with the first few let's do the first uh four terms this time what's the first term let's figure that out how much is how much is this when I plug in one so our first term here is going to be negative it said usually it starts off the positive doesn't have to all the time so our first term is going to be negative now we'd have one squar that's one over two fact so it's going to be one okay so -1/ 2 factorial which of course is just two but I'm going to leave it as 2 factorial so we we just keep the pattern okay I just want the first four to get the idea next one everybody am I going to get a plus or a minus plus get a plus that's right because this alternating series does that the only thing that's changing signs is this 1 to the N if I increase this to 2 the1 squ is positive one i' be adding this becomes what over very good and we can get the pattern really quick so this will be next so be negative then a plus then a minus what's going to go here here over here let's do one last one so netive plus minus plus and then what sure because we'd add the fourth term 4 S is 16 over 5 factorial and then it doesn't end goes forever and ever and ever notice this this is the same thing as some Series where we have -1 to the n * a subn where a subn is all positive terms the only thing that's changing the sign here is that1 to the end quick show hands feelc with what the alternating series do so alternating series is basically just having a negative 1 to some power that changes the signs every other sign of sequential terms now we do have What's called the alternating series test here's the test it's really straightforward it's not hard to do it uses some things that we've already talked about in this class so it's kind of nice here's the test for us four and alternating series so for some series for some series that's alternating by the way can you immediately tell that's going to be alternating series yes okay this series of course if you wanted to write the first few terms this would be a subn minus a subn plus or a I'm sorry a sub 1 a 1 - a sub 2 plus a sub 3 minus blah blah blah blah all the way till we get to a subn also what we want to what I want to tell you is that a subn itself a subn is positive terms does that make sense the only thing that's making this negative or negative is that negative 1 to a power so a subn is also positive that's the idea are you sure you're okay with that yeah the only thing that would be changing the sign would be the1 to the n minus1 in this case quick don't if you're you're right with that one okay so what I'm telling you is that an alternating series has ative 1 to a power times some other sequence that has positive terms these would all be pluses if it weren't for the negative one to a power agreed so that means that the a subn itself is going to be positive cool all right so with this as our condition if a sub n + 1 is less than or equal to a subn what's that say if a subn + 1 is less than or equal to a subn what's it tell you about the sequence from from which we get our series what's it telling you about that it is say say it louder decreasing it's decreasing can you explain why it's decreasing because the next term is smaller that's exactly right the next term is smaller do you guys understand we did this like a couple times before right do you understand this is the the term right after this one yeah if the term right after this one is smaller that means that we are decreasing so basically it says you're decreasing so if this is true for all end which means this is decreasing and the limit as n approaches Infinity is oh tell me something this is going to this is going to be good right this is us this is the thing that I have you do the first part of every single series we ever do I have you do this uh what what does this have to be do you think zero it's got to be zero now that's the that's basically the Divergence test now we don't really use a diverence test here because we don't include that negative 1 to n minus one but practically we do we use it on a subn so this is the Divergence test so basically what we're saying is hey if your series passes the Divergence test so basically look at the sequence of positive terms if your sequence of positive terms when you take a limit as n approach to Infinity equals zero and you know that the sequence of positive terms is decreasing for all n if you know that then you know that your alternating series is going to be convergent this is the test it has to be decreasing has to be decreasing I'll show you why in just a second okay let me recap this before I give you I'm not going to prove this I'll give you kind of like the graphical proof for it it's a very common sense type of idea once you see it okay so let me do like a 20 second recap to give you everything about alternating series that you really need to know first thing alternating series alternate signs for sequential terms it doesn't matter whether you start with a positive or negative typically we're going to start with a positive but it doesn't really matter what you need to know about these alternating series is they can always be broken up as -1 to some Power Times a sequence of positive terms 1 to some power time a sequence of positive terms does that make sense all you have to do for your alternating series test is first verify it's alternating verify it has one of these things does that make sense verify that if you can verify it's alternating then all you got to do is look at the limit of your sequence of positive terms look at your a subn if the limit of a subn equals z well you know what we do that anyway don't we that's a Divergence test so if the limit of a subn equals z says hey you might not be Divergent if the sequence is also decreasing so you look at the sequence of positive terms if it's decreasing which is what this says then you know it's convergent so all you got to show is that it passes the Divergence test as far as the sequence of positive terms is concerned does that make sense to you and that it's decreasing have we shown both those things at different times in this class Lots actually we were often in the habit of showing decreasing that was from monotonic bounding sequences we showed that they were decreasing we showed it for the uh integral test that was positive continuously decreasing now we're sh for alternating series just don't even worry about that though that's even part of it just look at your a subn if you can show your a subn sequence is decreasing man you're good if you can also show that the limit of a subn is n approach Infinity is zero that's the two parts of your test we've done both one's called the Divergence test most of the time one of them is just decreasing if you can show both those things then your series converges do you want to see why it converges okay remember here that what we're doing is we're adding up numbers right we're adding up numbers that alternate signs which means this are you listening we're going to start with one number we're going to subtract something right then we're going to add something then we're subtract something then we're going to add something then we're subtract something then we're going to add something then we subtract something then we're going to add something however listen carefully here's the whole Crux of this proof if your series is is decreasing then you start with a number correct let's assume it's positive it doesn't have to be it could be negative but let's assume it's positive if you subtract something it's going to go backwards right but it's not going to go to zero because what you're subtracting is smaller than what you originally have ises that make sense now you're going to add something to that aren't you but it's smaller than what you subtracted then you're going to subtract something but small what you add it and then back and forth so practically here's what it looks like you start with with let's say we start with uh start with zero here's zero after your first term do you remember this uh the the partial sums with it was the S we had that s subn for a partial sum so after your first term you'd have a sum S Sub one whatever that is you're going to have some sum because you only add you have one term make sense now because we know that this is decreasing you would subtract let's call it here and get the sum two after two terms that's what your sum would be do you understand that it would have to be positive here if I start with a positive number I'm going to subtract something that's smaller than that positive number true now I'm going to add something is it going to make it all the way back over to here no no it's got to be smaller than that because whatever I'm adding for my third term is going to be less than whatever I subtracted for my second and we keep on going because I'm decreasing I'm going to get closer and closer together do you see that ultimately what's going to happen lost my arrows didn't I so this way this way this way this way this way ultimately what's going to happen is that I'm kind of doing this pingpong match if you ever watch someone playing tennis right uh what you start here and you you you volly the ball over and some guy runs up and hits it let's pretend that these two guys start at the end of the Court and this guy hits the ball here and then he hits it back but doesn't go to the end then he hits it back but it gets closer and he gets closer and closer and closer to the net and these guys are come up like that and every time you hit the ball the guy steps forward a little bit does that make sense they're going to get really close to something that's what this is doing it's saying okay you're you're adding you start with one term then you're subtracting something less than that adding something less than that subtracting something less than that adding something less than that it's going to get really really close to one sum remember that the sums are what we're going to we're not adding all the rest of these things together these are the sums because you're subtracting numbers and adding numbers back and forth so sum number one hey subtract it sum number two add it sum number three subtract it sum number four because we're decreasing eventually I'm going to start adding and subtracting numbers which are so small they don't make a difference at Infinity show F if that makes make sense to you and that that's the idea of proving that this is convergent uh because it passes diers test and because we're decreasing and because it's alternating alternating series says yeah you're adding and you're subtracting sure but you're decreasing right so what you're adding subtracting keeps getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller therefore we're going to get really really really really close to one number eventually at term Infinity that term Infinity S Sub Infinity that be the limit of s subn as n approach Infinity hey we did that we did the limit of partial sums as n approaching Infinity that would be one number that's the idea have I explained that well enough you guys understand the the basis of this this test are you sure I don't want to leave anybody hanging on this one is it clear for you the whole adding then subtracting then adding something smaller subtrac and eventually you're going to get down to one number now let's go ahead and show how this actually works okay I'm actually going to start with this example are there any questions on on this other one so let's show what this one does first things first what must we show all the time every time for all our series ever basically oh okay doesn't necessarily have to pause of all the time uh continuity would be for the integral test you're on the right track for integral test for sure okay as far as every series ever what do we always check first the Divergence test so let's do that first so I know these are kind of out of order but I'm going to always show this one first because if I can show this one doesn't work I can just stop so number one we're going to take a limit as n approaches Infinity of a subn now please listen carefully when you do your limits and when you check for decreasing please look up here for right now look at this when you do that is -1 the nus1 part of your a subn no so basically we we ignore it that just says it alternating so right here we go okay you're alternating now look at this the rest of your series that is your Ace of n so when I'm looking at this one right here I'm looking at this one what part says it's alternating take that part away I'll put a little side note here for you recall a subn in this case is 1/ n it does not include the1 to a power that's why I made such a point about you can always pull out the alternating part and you can always have a series of positive ter or a sequence of positive terms that a subn so Advance if you understand that concept okay so do we need the the negative one I kind of reset with my palm here do we need this negative 1 nus inside my limit no no absolutely not all we've got to do is this is what it says folks it says the limit of a subn not the limit of the whole thing who cares it's just this little piece right there show it's decreasing well that's just the ace sub n not this piece who cares we just want to show that the sequence is actually decreasing that's the idea so for us I'm going to write this down a little bit let's take a limit of so practically What You Do cover that up write the rest of what's that going to be tell me what's the limit of 1 n as n approaches Infinity does that pass our version of the Divergence test for this yes I say our version of the Divergence test because we're not really taking a limit of the whole thing it's just the sequence positive terms that's what we're taking limit of so it's kind of our version of it for this so check that's that's brilliant what's the next thing that we should do decre we've got to show us decreas so this is a two-part test it's do the version of the Divergence test and then secondly show that this thing is actually decreasing so number two how in the world do we do that you could you could do it a couple ways um it's probably and and sometimes we're going to be using the derivative remember the derivative IA to show decreasing you call this thing a function you take a derivative and if the derivative is negative then the function is decreasing no problem well we can do that or sometimes it becomes a little bit just a little easier um for for instance um here's what I would say because it's so fast for this one here's how I would do it I'm move up so because I need a little room a subn + 1 is equal to 1 n + 1 correct you know I just asked correct but do you see that's coming from a sub n +1 says hey you plug in N +1 is that less than or equal to 1 n for all n that are positive and is this equal to a subn sometimes it's easier to do this than it is a derivative so right now this says that a subn + 1 is less or equal to a subn that shows that it is decreasing what about the fact that it's a harmonic series okay we're talk about that right now I want to make sure that this is okay with you all right do you understand that this is an alternating series hello yes no yes what says it alternating uh are you okay that the limit of the sequence from which our series is built as far as as sub is concerned is equal to zero Ence test are you okay that this sequence is also decreasing so a subn was 1 n we showed that the limit of that sequence is zero satisfied that part we also showed that this thing is decreasing because well if I add one to this I have 1 n + 1 that's always less than 1 n for all n greater than 1 brilliant okay well that's equal to a subn so now I've shown that a subn + 1 is less than a subn that said that's decreasing so I satisfied this by the alternating series test we have something that's alternating we have something where the limit of our sequence is zero we have something that is decreasing tell me something about this series it converges it Absolut it converges so we write this way so by the alternating series test yes you have to State what you're using here there's going to be a lot of freaking tests okay so State what you're using by alternating series test because it passed the Divergence test because our our sequence was decreasing we know that by the alternating series test the series of -1 N - 1 n converges okay honestly that is the entire lesson that's the whole idea there's only one alternating series test there's only one thing you do with it and that's it did that make sense to you now of course we're going do a few more examples sure but this is this is practically the idea show F if you feel okay with the idea now this is what's really interesting um if I take this away if I look at this if I look at this series what is that series Harmon harmonic series tell me something about the harmonic Series diverges this is called the alternating harmonic series do you see why it's called the alternating harmonic series it is a harmonic series only it's alternating the alternating harmonic series is actually converging and that's weird so the harmonic series diverges yet the alternating harmonic series converges I can be confusing it can be confusing so make sure you mind your p's and q's or harmonic series and Alternate harmonic Series this is the alternating harmonic series and yes it converges now fortunately for us we don't really base anything on the alternating harmonic series we don't say that oh this is always less than alter Alterna harmonic series don't really do that and so all these are kind of made from scratch anyway so you don't necessarily have to remember that I would like you to because it's important we will use it eventually uh but you can always redo it okay with alternating series test we use the harmonic series a lot because we're always doing well it's kind of like a PE Series so you could just think of it as a PE series but we always compare things to it a lot so that's kind of nice to know let's continue [Applause] tell me something about this series please what do you see right off the bat that says this is this type of series it's alternating how do you know it's alternating very good so we know it's alternating what are we going to use for alternating series probably the alternating series test because it's an alternating series yeah and that's the easiest test we have for this okay Show's decreasing show the limit of a subn is z can you tell me what is a subn in this [Music] case yeah that's exactly right it's not hard to do now what would you do first if I gave this to you on a test would you show it's decreasing first or would you show the Divergence test first what would you do I would do that first why because it's easy it's easier okay so even if we were to show I I'll show it decreasing here real quick by the way um and this case it's a lot easier to show with a function with a derivative than it is by showing it directly like this one this is why I give this example um this sometimes is hard to do sometimes really easy like this was easy but if I wanted to show that 2 n + 1 over 4 n + 1 - 1 is less than or equal to 2 N / 4 n - 1 I might run into some trouble okay it's just harder to do it's harder to actually show that does that make sense so rather than do that I'd be like no I I don't think so I would think of FX = 2x over 4X -1 I would find a derivative of that thing by the way um all of this is kind of a moot point do you understand that do you understand that when I take the limit of this it's going to equal 12 and that's not zero therefore this thing will diverge by the alternating series test by the Divergence test uh but I'm just showing you um something extra right now okay so if you didn't show it like this you could show it with a derivative it would be low D High minus high D low and square the bottom way we the way we do I think if I did it right looks like I did did you get that too if you did it -2 over bunch of junk yes so um is this thing always negative what do you think is this thing always positive is this always negative negative over positive is a so this is less than zero always therefore if that's always less than zero What's it tell you it's de it's decreasing this is a this is a slope yes the slope is negative a slope that's negative says that your function is decreasing since our function is modeling our sequence for us it says that our sequence is also decreasing I'll say that one more time because I'm sure it didn't see in some of you aren't even looking at me my goodness people in video they're watching me you should watch me too so they're probably texting they probably are texting sub texting anyway so if this is a derivative means a slope if the slope is negative which it always is that means that the function is decreasing since this function contains every point of our sequence our sequence is also decreasing for anything n greater than one one no problem so this says decreasing would that be good for convergence as far as our alternating series test is concerned would that be good for us yeah that would have to be decreasing so that fits half of it now of course what we would have done first this is number one we do a limit of 2 n/ 4 n - 1 as n approaches infinity and we would get 1 half by whatever you want to do with that you're going to get 1/2 so should be located with that one what's that say this is not zero in practicality if you were doing this problem on a test you would not even get to this you'd say let's do a limit first let's do the limit of this guy limit of this guy is oh2 is that equal to zero by the alternating series test by the Divergence test series Divergence you wouldn't even make it to that why would you do extra work work when this already tells you that it diverges show up hands if that made sense to you okay so yeah it decreases but it's not just about decreasing okay both of these things have to work in concert to give you a convergent series understood let's keep going really we're only going to do one more and then we're we're done we're done with uh with this because it's it's all the same it's all the same same stuff by the way do you have questions on that forgot this time now of course just because it's all the same doesn't mean everything is super easy all the time I mean you just have to show stuff bless you you got to show stuff so let's start with this uh you're given this problem on the test what do you do Panic pee your pants run out of class I never learned any of this seriously it honestly happened in class one time it was a final yeah person stood up I don't remember any of this crap threw his test down and walked out it's awesome not in my class in someone else's class but did they pass no they failed a final anyway uh so what do you do what do you do on this on this uh what kind of series what kind of okay what kind of series is it what are you going to use for alternating series alter series now yeah I'm going to give you a couple other tests that do work for alternating series okay so for right now that's all you got I will give you some that are sometimes nicer and we're we're going to see when they're nicer when we get there all right specifically have things like uh factorials stuff like that where this would be very hard to show with factorials possibly because well we're going to take a derivative do you know how to do derivatives of factorials no no we don't so we can show with other other techniques as well but right now if it's alternating series use alternating series test what are you going to do first ladies and gentlemen okay let's look at a subn what is our a subn in our case okay now what would you do decreasing or limit first li D do first then how would you show this limit how would you do it there's two ways that I can think of right now how would you do it the one top what do you mean well yeah say you could divide everything by n that would be one option can't do that oh yeah you could actually you could do numerator denominator not going to help us all that much but I like where you're at you would use that if you had a conjugate you use a conjugate you might try Lal sure could you do lals yeah why not you could do that I don't know if both are going to work I the only one I would see is divide by n that's what I would do um if you did lalls let's see do you understand why we can use lalls right now everybody LS might actually be pretty nice because uh what's the derivative of n minus one I like getting ones on denominator don't know about you guys but that's kind of nice right this gives You2 actually you know what all I make it nice U this would give you 1/ 2 < TK n + 1 can you verify that for me to make sure I didn't do a mistake but if you do it remember that this is n + 1 12 so a Lal would do 12 n+ 1 to the 12 that's over a square root so this would be a if I did a derivative you'd get the here's the 1/2 here's the N plus 1 to the2 uhhuh now let that go to Infinity what's what's n is n infinity infinity plus one Infinity sare OT INF * 2 1 over infinity 0 over 1 does it pass the Divergence test as it's concerned for alternate could you have done as Aaron suggested and divide everything by n be careful on this if you divide everything by n what happens is you do this n + 1 over n nus one over sorry like that you [Music] no true yes kind of true this remember all these would have to be equal correct this does not always equal this that is not true all the time this always equals that that is true all the time you need to be careful on that now of course why are we unconcerned where does n start and it goes to so it's always positive so for that case it doesn't really matter but if you would had n going to negative Infinity just in case you ever get a limit where n goes to negative Infinity um that changes to a negative n are you all clear on that so just be careful yeah you can do it because n's going to positive Infinity you're good okay uh this is absolutely true but this is really the definition of it okay anyway in either case that you get you would get zero so let's go let's let's backtrack a bit the first thing you do is you test a limit that's basically like the Divergence test for alternating series did it pass yes so should I stop or keep going keep going does it say that we're convergent right now no not yet but we're halfway there possibly possibly conver number two what's number two show decreasing tell you what trying to show this is less than or greater than n + 1 + 1 in a < TK over n + 1 - one can be tricky what might we want to do instead of that let's do derivative so here's how you do the derivative you say okay let's pretend this thing is a function of x and by the way do I want to include this in my derivative no heck no I want x + 1 over x -1 that's what I want to do so let's take a derivative of that guy so oh man low D High minus high D L Square the bottom and away we go correct me if I'm wrong if you see mistakes please do that I'm just going to do it kind of quickly oh goodness that's nasty what would you do did you get that far by the way yeah what would you do now give up simplify yeah get a common denominator combine your numerators it's complex fraction right now this sucks complex fractions always say get one fraction on the numerator one fraction denominator and go for it so in our case we get let's see uh x -1 - 2 * x + 1 all over 2 < TK x + 1 over X - 1 2 at least I believe so I'm kind of doing it quick in my head but you'd have to multiply by 2 rootx + 1 over X over 2un x + 1 and that would give you this still okay so far yeah let's keep on rolling so we'd have fime of x equals what do we get on that numerator looks to me like it's x - 3 did you get thatx - 3 yeah x - 3 all over if you do all of this you're going to end up with 2 > x + 1 * x -1 2 go no further because we're not trying to figure out a limit so don't think oh man we got to we got to do a limit we got to get rid of X on the numerator who cares about that all we're trying to see is whether this is positive all the time or negative all the time are you with me are you listening yes it's a derivative right derivative gives you increasing versus decreasing so we make it this far make it to one fraction then look at your fraction is that positive is this always positive is this always positive so your denominator is always positive your numerator is your numerator always positive no it's always if n is if x is greater than one yes absolutely because if x is one you get negative 1 x is 2 you get -2 x is you're going to get Negative whatever you plug in does that make sense that means that this is always less than Z for X greater than or equal one here's where we make the jump we've done this several times I'm do it one more time this function is modeling our sequence right now which means that every term of our sequence will be somewhere on our function do you get that this can includes way more points than this will ever have since this function is always decreasing we prove that by taking a derivative the derivative is always negative a negative derivative says that your function is decreasing that's what it says so since our slope is negative function is decreasing since it's decreasing for every X greater than or equal to one that means that because a sequence fits in here the sequence is also decreasing for every n greater than or equal to one two hands if you understand that concept therefore this says a subn is is decreasing let's put it all together all of it right now um do we have an alternating series yes alternating series says so this says alternating we look at our sequence does the limit of our sequence from which our alternating series is built does that limit as n approaches Infinity equals zero that passes that Divergence part of this test then we do the second one is the sequence from which our alternating series is built also decreasing everywhere yes so alternating series test says if it's alternating if it passes the Divergence test if it's decreasing those three things what do you know about this given Series so by alternating series test or a the given series that we have converges uh by the way if you notice something we kind of set this for n greater than or equal to 1 um yeah you can't really have it equal to one you pick two pick something like that now if we said two is it going to make a difference or equal to two now as a matter of fact our series don't even start t two but even if you it didn't even if those numbers didn't work out please recall that you can add or subtract a finite number of terms from your series and you still have the same convergence or Divergence does that make sense to you so it doesn't even matter if they don't really match up yeah your sum would be different but because we have this series idea of convergence or Divergence rather than find the sum okay did make sense for you all right so the last little bit of talking about alternating series now here's the deal have you ever wondered if a series goes forever and has a sum and we can't add forever how in the world can we say the sum of a series is what it is well the limit ident lets us know that but if you understand this about the series if I add a finite number of terms there will be some sort of difference between the sum of the series and the sum that I have does that make sense in other words there's going to be some sort of error well let's talk a little bit about finding error on our series here's what we know if your series converges then it will have some some let's call it s and we also know this this is old stuff we also know if we take a limit of partial sums as n approaches Infinity then the limit of partial sums will equal that sum s [Applause] let me let me explain that with some uh some different notation so if I take a limit of s subn uh do you recognize that notation s subn s subn was a partial sum it said hey uh find the sum after n terms find the sum after five terms after 10 terms after n terms as n approaches infinity and this was our very first kind of an idea for finding the sum of a series it said tell me what a partial sum is then let N Go to Infinity because if n goes to Infinity this part the limit of partial sums is n appro to Infinity will equal the sum of the series that was the whole idea this is old stuff do you recognize the old stuff if you need a brush up it's in uh one of the first sections on series I think it was like four sessions ago so this is what that that said it said hey take a partial sum no problem let N Go to Infinity then that partial sum will equal the some of our series old stuff well if this is true if the limit of partial sums ASO Infinity equals s then the difference between these things will equal what as n approaches Infinity if these things are equal as n approaches Infinity what's the difference between them should be zero it should be and it is does that make sense to you if the limit of s subn is n approach Infinity is s then the difference between them would be zero x n approach to Infinity as n approach to Infinity you guys okay with that so far now I made a statement as an approaches Infinity so what would happen if n doesn't get to Infinity if we don't have the statement so if we don't actually get to Infinity is this still going to be zero no there will be some error let me write that down for you so you have a little bit of note so now if n doesn't actually approach Infinity there's going to be some difference between S subn and S does that make sense if we don't actually get to Infinity now we kind of usually can't get to Infinity we have this definition of limit saying and approaches Infinity but if we don't actually get there there's going to be a difference between S subn and S we call that difference error or we have a special name for it we call it R subn you guys get the idea here I'm going to write down so you're hopefully still with me so if n does not approach Infinity or in other words it never makes it okay so if we stop somewhere along the way if n does not approach infinity or doesn't actually get there there will be some error between S and S subn we call that error AR okay let me let me recap just a little bit okay so here's the idea the idea is yeah if a series converges it's got to have a sum no problem this would be true as well if we take a limit of our partial sums as n approaches Infinity we say yeah go to Infinity guess what the limit of your partial sums is going to equal the sum of your series no problem we we had that last time well we had that several times ago and we also say if I subtract these two yeah the limit would equal zero if n goes to Infinity now assume that n stops before infinity it goes for a long long way but it stops before infinity this is no longer true because I don't have this idea of a limit I don't have the idea of and going to Infinity does that make sense to you I have okay we're stopping somewhere well then the partial sum is probably going to be pry let's say we do the first thousand terms okay the partial sums probably going to be really close to that sum of the series it's going to be really really close but it's not going to be exact because we didn't get to Infinity does that make sense to you so if we now this what I'm saying here now say n doesn't approach Infinity okay stop somewhere there's going to be some error it's going to be really close but there's going to be some error show hands if that made sense feel okay okay so here's what we know since there will be some error between these if I take s minus s subn this is what we're calling R subn basically it means this and hopefully this this makes sense Ren stands for your error that's what it is so this says that your error is equal to what's s stand for of the sum of the series that's what we said sum of the series sum so this would be like the idea of the whole sum the sum of the series the whole thing so the whole sum minus part of the sum that's a partial Su part of the SU so we have okay if we don't go to Infinity there's going to be a difference between these guys make sense we call that difference R subin naturally it would say the error is equal to well can you does that make sense to you the notation well this is error right it says take the whole thing subtract off part of it that gives you the difference between them that gives you the error so we have a equals whole sum minus part of sum it's a very wholes sum idea that we have oh man now the following is for alternating series only and you'll see why I'll explain why in just a moment why it's for alternating series only uh this idea okay we we have this but now we're going to apply to our alternating series why we're in this section now so for alternating series only [Applause] for alternating series only we have the following idea it's very interesting to explain why after I put it on the on the board here this is this is kind of cool check it out uh we know this is true error equals the whole minus the part true mhm now because we're dealing with alternating series this right here could be positive or negative right could be well actually this could be positive or negative we're going to make this absolute value because of the next thing we're going to do here's what I know and this is the interesting part of this hopefully you believe this true you believe that already yes no yes here's what I know this error is always going to be less than or equal to a sub n +1 always now some of you probably thinking oh yeah that makes sense some of like what in the world are you even talking about a subn + 1 think about this for a second s subn would be the sum when you start when you stop the sum when you stop at the nth term does that make sense says go a sub 1 a sub 2 a sub 3 a sub 4 a sub 5 a sub 6 a sub 7 a subn and add them all together that's what this is s stands for the whole thing what I'm saying is that this difference is less than or equal to the next term after you have stopped so you do a sub 1 a sub 2 a sub 3 a sub 4 a sub 5 a subn the next one would be a subn plus one right if you add all this up and you subtract it from s that difference is less than the next term the why in the world is that we'll talk about it right now here here's the Y uh let's let's consider what s is s would be a sub one M remember this is alternating and the reason why this only works for alternating I'll show you in a reason okay but this is alternating series show in just a minute why the reason is this is alternating series so it be a sub 1 a sub 2 a sub 3 blah blah blah blah and eventually you get a true now would s stop there yes s would go forever s never stops so s would do n + 1 minus a sub n + 2 plus and it would go forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever does that make sense to you now here's the deal this is all of s so this is the whole thing I'm going to write it a little differently this whole thing is s does that make sense can you find s s subn somewhere in that that series you have to be right because s subn is a partial sum it's part of that sum so it's got to be in there somewhere where does s subn stop that's s of n does that make sense hello yes no yes now here's the cool part the rest of this by definition here would have to be S after I take away s subn does that make sense to you hey look it if the whole thing's s and this first part is s subn then the rest of it is s minus s of n that's what the rest of it is now understand something about why alternating series plays a part of this check out what the what the terms do the next term after this is a sub n +1 correct now I'm assuming that's going to be a plus it doesn't have to be that's why we have the absolute value I don't care what it is it's absolute value so I have that a sub n +1 let's assume it's positive what's the next thing I'm doing subtracting I'm subtracting from it I'm making it smaller aren't I Now understand that with altern alting series like this we have this idea that it's decreasing okay we have the idea it's decreasing because it's convergent alternating series that are convergent this would have to be the case it would have to be decreasing it would have to have the limit of your sequence being zero it would have to be alternating so we're already stating this is convergent does that make sense to you this is not an alternating series that increases otherwise this wouldn't even happen does that make sense so th are are you am I talking over your heads here or you guys you guys with me I hope you're with me I want you to be with me here so if it's it's convergent and it's an alternating series then it must be a decreasing sequence as subn must be decreasing what that means as far as a convergent alternating series why this is important is because if we have this as s minus s subn here's my first term after S A subn my very first one do you understand that if something's decreasing every term will be less than that in absolute value it's going to be less than that so I'm subtracting that made it smaller I'm adding it made it bigger but since I'm adding something smaller than what I subtracted in terms of absolute value it's never going to make it back to what a subn plus 1 is does that make sense start with any number like 10 subtract something from it like n add something smaller than that like eight are you ever going to make it back to 10 no no that's what the idea of a decreasing convergent alternating series has to do with this says alternating is important because I'm not continually adding I'm subtracting then adding then subtracting then adding then subtracting then adding I'm never going to make it back to the 10 because my my sequence of terms is decreased show P if that made sense well if that's the case then what we know is that this whole thing must be less than or equal to a sub n + 1 and that's exactly what we're getting right here that's the whole idea I'm going to write that hopefully you guys can see it a little bit clearer so this this is s - s subn it must be less than because it's decreasing because we're alternating a subn + 1 and that's exactly what we have we say R is Def R subn is defined as the difference between this and this so basically this guy this is my error this is my error it's the difference between my sum and my partial sum this is the error because that error has to be less than my very first term after I stop my partial sum we have this as our definition for our error did they explain that well enough for you guys to understand it okay let me show you how it works in practicality do you have any questions on any of this stuff because I'm going to erace this and start my example over here are we good okay so let's start with an example and I'll show you where the error comes into play Let's do a series like this you know if we're going to talk about finding error we better make sure that we have a convergent series it really wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to find error if we didn't know that this was a convergent series would that make sense because if this things adds to Infinity well how we going to how find error that doesn't doesn't even work so by the way finding error only works for convergent alternating series so we're going to have to make sure that this thing actually converges does that converge don't just guess at it have we shown anything about it okay so you tell me how I show that it actually does converge Divergence has to be first firstly actually before that tell me what type of Series this is Alter alternating so with an alternating series you might want to use the alternating alternating series test is two parts alternating series says does it pass the Divergence test for alternating series so basically by the way uh what is your a subn here do you know what your a subn is one n factorial yeah just cover that up so the alternating series test says number one I want to find a limit of a sub n everybody what does that have to be in order to continue and say it's not necessarily Divergent is it so that passes the first part of my alternating series test it equals zero it's like the Divergence test for alternating series number two what's the next thing we've got to show for alternating series past the limit of your sequence equals zero decreasing decreasing why is decreasing important because it's because it's alternating if you keep going back and forth plus minus plus minus your term get bigger it's not going to work but if you turns get smaller remember that whole Su idea we went forward then back forward back eventually we're going to once and we wouldn't even be able to find error if it wasn't decreasing so yeah it's got to be decreasing is it decreasing would you show decreasing here with a derivative no why not factorial okay so we'd start with a subn + 1 we show that a subn + 1 is greater than or less than a subn l want this to always be going less than the next one so we want to show that this is ultimately less than or equal to a subn how much is a subn + 1 you know how to find the next term you start with whatever a subn is it already gives you a subn and then you just add one to many NS you got so for us it'd be one over n + one factorial yep n plus1 factorial does that make sense to you is it true and by the way here's a subn right uh a subn is 1 / n factorial is it true that this is less than or equal to this yes then we've proven that a subn + 1 is less than a subn and that's a second part of our alternating series test that says that this thing is decreasing should that made made sense to you this is old stuff so what we would say is by the alternating series test yes you have to tell me what test you're using by the alternating series test because our our sequence as subn limit of that is n for Infinity equals Zer that passes that diverence test because our next term is less than our previous term that shows that we're decreasing by alternating series tests in these two conditions we know that the series that we have started with our given series does what that's right if the series converges this is our condition if the series converges there will be some error between a partial sum and the sum of the series so you have to show it converges first before you start doing this nonsense because otherwise this does not matter does that make sense to you so we go right well it can converges therefore between any partial sum and sum of the series there will be some sort of an error now here's how you use the error you ever wondered well what's the point of doing some of this because yeah we know it converges but we still can't find the sum so why are we doing it well we can find the sum to a close enough value for us and this is how we do it with an alternating series at least what you do with the uh the error what you do with the error you tell the series how accurate you want to be then you find the number of terms it takes to be that accurate some of you looking one sound like a riddle yes well I'll explain that in just a second let's start with what we know what we know is that there's going to be some sort of an error and we know that that error will be the difference between the sum and the partial sum in terms of value and we also know that this will be less than a subn + 1 does that make sense hello yes no okay now do you have an expression for a subn + 1 yes yes you do in fact we just had it if you didn't you could make it easily you look right here and you just do n + 1 so for us we know that this is the same thing as 1/ n + one factorial you okay with that M okay so practically speaking we know that R subn must be less than or equal to 1/ n + 1 factorial now again here's the way that the error Works do you write this down maybe I should write this down for you here's the way error works you tell the series the paral sum you tell the series how accurate you want to be and then you use the error whatever this is to tell you how many terms you need to be that accurate tell series you tell it so how the air works you tell the series how accurate you want to be then you use R suben to determine the error to determine how many terms are needed to be that accurate let me give you uh an idea so F firstly are you okay getting down this far quicke if you're okay with that so here's the way that we go from here somewhere along the way you're going to get a number like uh 0.5 or 0.001 or something like that and I'm going to give this to you on a test or you homewor and give it to you and say tell you what I want you to find the partial sum such that so example such that I want R subn in terms of absolute value to be less than or equal to 005 now please don't just do this by rote memorization of how you do a process like an algorithm okay understand what this says what this really says is I want you to get the difference between the sum and the partial sum to be less than 0 actually let's just do L time less than .5 I want the error to be less than 005 so what that means is that I want you to give me the term so that when I do that amount and I add my partial sum that it's going to be less than this much difference from the sum of my series are you catching that say it one more time so really hopefully sinks in what this says is that I want you to tell me how many terms I need so that when I add them all up this is the difference the difference between my partial sum which you just added and the sum of the series the whole thing is less than 00005 that would be 10 hundreds up to the 10 5 10,000 so it would be very very close now the reason why we have absolute value this could be the partial sum could be a little over it or it could be a little under it but it will be within 510,000 of that that's pretty darn accurate does that make sense to you okay so here's what we do we go right we cool well tell you what uh we know know that R subn has to be less than this right so and we we want R subn to definitely be less than this so here's what we do we go if our subn has to be less than this if we make our last term less than 0.005 would that not fit the condition of R subn being less than that hope I didn't blow your minds I see some some wheels turning here what's happened to this okay here check it out you're given an error right your error has to be less than 05 in this case where' that come from I made it out it's going to be given to you or you come up with it on your own later on whatever so I want my error to be less than this well if my last term I make my last term I make my last last term less than 005 I know for a fact R subn is less than my last term so if I make my last term less than this number whatever my error is then R subn for sure is going to be less than that because this is even this is less than this this is less than that bam so set your last this as easy as is set your last term your a actually your next term a sub n plus one set that less than your error solve for n done now how we solve for n can get exciting did you know that if you take a reciprocal of an inequality your inequality just reverses did you know that mhm so then I do n + 1 factorial is greater than 1 over 005 can you tell me how much is 1 over 005 2000 it's 2,000 that's right 2000 you guys okay with whether the 2,000 came from your calculators you'll be okay with it in like 5 Seconds okay so if I do a reciprocal of both these sides then my inequality switches around no problem now there's no way to explicitly solve for n we cannot do it here we're not going to do it here so just start thinking about this start pluging in some numbers tell me something if I plug two all I need is for this to be more than 2,000 does that make sense if this is more than 2,000 then this will be less than 05 then our error will be less than 05 actually should be way less than that but this is the idea so uh how about one if I plug in nals 1 is that enough cuz that's two factorial if I plug in two is that enough that's three factorial that would be six six not more than 2,000 if I plug in uh three no that would be four factorial four factorial is 24 isn't it think so * yeah six okay so is that more than 2,000 no uh how about five they plug in five watch your fo 120 no say what no 120 no that's not big enough how about six I'm plug in six 720 7 if I plug in remember if I plug in six I'm adding one to it if I plug in five okay let's let's let me start again I got distracted so if I plug in five 5 + 1 would give me six how much is six factorial 720 that's 720 that's not more than 2,000 let's plug in 6 if I plug in N = 6 I get 6 + 1 is 7 7 factorial is is that more than 2,000 yes so the first term that satisfies this for me is n = 6 does that make sense to you okay now now what we do with that we say this if I take an add well I'm going to add and subtract because it's alternating series if I take and add the first six terms that partial sum will be within way within in this case way within 51,000 of the actual sum so what we're going to do we're going to find sub sub6 we're going to find s six s sub6 just says add the first six terms what did we start with anyway forgot what my series is what's it going to look like s sub6 remember we start at zero so let's do that don't start at once one first one's going to be one that's right if I start at zero I get one next I'm going to get a minus and then I'm going to get a plus and I'm going to get a minus and then get a plus and so forth and so on let's plug in one remember we start at zero here so we start at zero now we plug in one when I plug in one what do I [Applause] get plug in two I get I plug in three I get 1 over 3 factorial + 1 4 factorial - 1 5 factorial I ran out a room are we okay with all that should okay so let's figure out what it is this is 1 - 1 + 12 - 16 + 112 sorry 124 - over 120 + 1 over 700 that 720 yes you can really kind of see the error taking place right now check this out do you see how firstly are you okay getting that far make sure I got it right too did I get it right yes hope I did do you see how small these fractions are getting M the next one's going to be really really small 1 over 5,000 something really small and I'm going to be subtracting it well that's not taking away very much and after that I'm going to add but I'm not adding very much it's not going to change that much so here's what we know if I do this on your calculator whatever what I'm going to get I'm going to do the math for you but maybe you can double check this I get 0368 did you get 368 if you add that okay let me get double check here real quick did you get the same thing okay just make sure that my math was right as well so here's what we know let's put everything together right now okay here's what we know s sub6 was this correct that works down to this partial sum the sum of the first six terms usually seven terms because we had the S Sub Zero term so first seven term is n was six so you still got to go by whatever your series says all right add the first however many it takes to get up to n equals 6 in this case here's what I know is this equal to is this equal to S is this equal to S Toler is it equal to S no is it a good approximation for s yes how good so good that this number is within 5 10,000 of this it's that good and that's how you use the error did that make sense to you that's the idea folks show hands you understand the idea you feel okay with it cool all right 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 9.6:  Absolute Convergence, Ratio Test and Root Test For Series
in section 9.6 we're going to talk about something you see if you haven't noticed this uh we've had a lot of conditions that say well for integral test you have to have positive continuously decreasing for the comparison tests we had to have positive terms positive terms and we had to compare it for limit comparison test we had to have positive terms how do we deal with negative terms well one way we deal with negative terms is alternating series test that's when it alternates we go positive negative positive negative positive that's great no problem what if it doesn't alternate how do we deal with negative terms if your sequence from which your series is built does not alternate and that's what this comes in it says well you know what you can do you can do what's called absolute convergence I'm going to show you what absolute convergence is I'm going to tell you when you should be using it I'm going to give you two tests that are built upon the absolute convergence idea these are the some of the most powerful tests that you have okay one very very powerful test called the ratio test which we're not going to get to today we'll get to next time on this video so here's what absolute convergence says if you're given a series if you take the series and you take the absolute value of the terms so you take the absolute value of the sequence from which your series is built what that would be for instance would be a sub 1 an absolute value plus a sub 2 in absolute value plus blah law forever and ever and everever so basically it changes any possible negative terms into positive terms do you guys get the idea what absolute value does so absolute conversion says hey you know what consider you got a series no big deal take an absolute value of that series and it's just going to be an absolute value of your terms all of them added together is there ever going to be something you subtract is there ever going to be a negative okay if this thing is convergent so if this is convergent then we say the series that you've got this from is absolutely convergent so we go okay is a series convergent I don't know I don't know if it's convergent let's do the absolute value if we we do the absolute value and the series of the absolute value of as subn converges then this original series is called absolutely converion I'm going to try to go quickly so I get you at least one example U but let me let me show you what this is for so this is used for things like this it's used for lots of things but especially things like this which we're going to deal with this example next time series of of s of 2 n/ n^2 tell me something uh is it always positive no no is it always decreasing no tell me something is it uh is it alternating no because sign is continuous and goes like this between negative 1 and one the whole so is it alternating no there's a series of terms where it's like negative negative negative positive positive positive positive POS so is it always positive no is it Alterna no it's not always positive and it's not alternating this is where we' use absolute convergence for sure it'd be very easy with this I'm going show you that probably next time so not alternating not always positive let me give you an example that we we can do we're going to do this one next time but I'll show you minute how about that one series from 1 to Infinity of 1 nus1 n^ 2 tell me something you know about this series you should know it because we it's alternating that's right is it uh is the limit equal to zero of that sequence from which a series is built yes and is it always decreasing yes yes it sure is we know that's convergent check out what absolute converion says it says hey how about this one how about if I just go well let's do the series of the absolute value what would an absolute value do to this right here so this would be the series of 1/ n² tell me something but by the way are you okay on doing that ABS value n s is n s no problem absolute value of1 to I don't care what it's to it's going to be pos1 tell me something about this P ser and is it a convergent P series yes so this is a p series P equal 2 p does equal two that says this converges now don't stop there say one more thing here's what this whole thing means okay check it out if you take the absolute value of your series bam your sequence basically from what you you get your series if you take the absolute value of your sequence in your series if this series converges then your original series absolutely converges absolutely as being I took the absolute value it's absolutely convergent this thing is so we say this way so series -1 n -1 / n^ 2 AB absolutely [Music] convergence now if you're wondering wait a second why is that word absolutely important why does it matter I'm going to show you with the ne next and final example that we're going to do why there's a difference between converges and absolutely converges you with me so here's what we're doing we're taking the absolute value of our sequence and we're seeing whether that new series converges if it does then we say original series absolutely converging you know what I'm not going to have enough time for this one I'm going to write it down we're do it next time but here it is I'll consider this I'll talk briefly about it right now but we'll we'll talk more about it next time do you recognize that as the alternating harmonic series yes alternate harmonic series is convergent we proved it with alternating series test last time how about if I take the absolute value I get one over n what's that that's harmonic series and it's Divergent you can have series that are absolutely sorry U convergent but not abs absolutely convergent which says absolute convergence is stronger than convergence and we're going to talk about that next time so what's the all right so let's continue our talk about absolute convergence now I left you with this example we talked just a little bit about it so let's consider the series from 1 to Infinity of1 nus1 / n there's something we know already from the last section that's alternating series we know that this right here is called the alternating harmonic series you guys remember talking about that it's alternating that's the harmonic Series so this was the alternating harmonic series Also let's think about alternating harmonic series firstly it's it's alternating right does the limit of a subn go to zero as n approaches Infinity yes is the limit sorry is a subn decreasing yes by the alternating series test this is for sure convergent so it converges quick head if you're okay with that so far that's old stuff all right now here's what we know we know from this section this absolute convergence that if we take the absolute value of our sequence from M series is built if we take the absolute value with inside of our series and that series still converges then our original series was called absolutely convergent because it's converges with its absolute value does that make sense to you so let's go ahead and do it so if we take the absolute value of -1 to the nus one over n what does the absolute value do for us what's it going to do here yes right so what's it doe to this Ser what's it change it to anytime you have a negative one to any power you're going to get one or negative one no problem in abs value would take the one and make it one take the negative one and make it one it's going to get rid of any of those negatives so this thing that's completely gone what do I get and the N does it change the N no now think back a little further tell me what series this is that's right tell me something about the harmonic Series yeah you could have also said it's a p series couldn't you with a p equals 1 either way what do you know about it that diverges so this is the harmonic series and it diverges now let's put this together so here's the deal if you have a series and you take the absolute value of it and the series that you get after that diverges what that says is that your original series is not absolutely convergent now here's the problem that students run into here they go oh well look at this if I take the absolute value of something and it works out to be Divergent uh my original series is Divergent is that true no no we started out with this claim right that's the alternating harmonic series we already proved it converges does that make sense so when I say okay cool well let's do the absolute convergence test well if I do absolute convergence and I get something that Di verges all that says so my original series is not absolutely converging or does not absolutely converge I'm going say it this way is not absolutely convergent okay what's what's that mean well here's the deal you can have a series that is not absolutely convergent but is converging you know what what in the world are you talking about well let's look at it we have a series here that we know for sure is convergent by the alternating Ser uh series test we've already shown it in the last section we had it when we do absolute convergence of that same series we get a series that is Divergent are you with me still saying that my original series while it's convergent it is not absolutely convergent because it does not pass the absolute convergence test it doesn't work so fany you understand that concept what this is called the scenario when you have a series that is not absolutely convergent but it is convergent so convergent but not absolutely convergent that's called conditionally convergent does that make sense to you so that that's the the name of it so when you have a series that converges but does not absolutely converge it's called conditionally convergent so this scenario so this this idea is called condition convergence so we got a few things going on we can have a series that's just straight up Divergent if I just gave you this one just the series on the board alone nothing else around it just a series of 1/ n that's a harmonic series that's Divergent nothing to it does that make sense to you okay we can have a series that is convergent but not absolutely convergent so here we go alternating harmonic series it's convergent it's not absolutely convergent or we can have a series that is absolutely convergent now here's the thing absolute convergence is stronger than convergence you can see it right here you can have a series that converges but is not absolutely convergent what that means is that anytime you know that a series is absolutely convergent you know for sure it is convergent absolute convergence is the strongest thing that we have so we have three levels we have Divergent nothing we got conditionally convergent that's kind of like okay cool it's not too the absolute convergence level but it's still convergent and then we have like the Super One absolute convergence so if we can show absolute convergence that's good as we can get okay that shows that it's convergent all the time absolute convergence is the strongest that we have if something converges absolutely it converges all the time show pant if you understand that one okay so make a couple little notes absolute convergence convergence come on leard is stronger than convergence other note if a series is absolutely convergent you know for sure it is convergent let me give you a real quick example right now just to illustrate this I think I gave you this example in the opening of this section but uh we we never really worked on it so here we go let's talk about this series s of 2 N over N2 okay let's look at it let's go through the whole process proc all right a whole process would be can't shoot what is the whole process what would we do first I would always do Divergence test first for sure now s of 2 n/ n^2 + 1 the limit as n approaches Infinity what do you think zero it is zero yeah this is always going between what two numbers Z and that number's getting really I don't care what it is you divide something between 1 and one by Infinity you're going to get zero does that make sense passes adversion test uh is this a p series not even freaking close come on guys no how about a geometric series there's a sign in it how about uh telescoping series we haven't talked about that one in a while no how about integral test no I don't want to do that that that'd be really hard to do the integral I don't even know if we can do the integral of that one okay no it's not alternating because sign doesn't alternate just negative 1 one negative 1 one it it oscillates between them that's true but it doesn't alternate like that so we couldn't use an alternating series so the one thing we're left with is well maybe we try absolute convergence here let's see if that that does a trick we can't use the comparison tests because our terms are not always positive does that make sense so we can't use it straight up right now but what we can do is say all right if we do the absolute value if we do the absolute value let's consider what the absolute value of sin 2N does so I'm going to take a little break here for a second uh do you agree that s of X is always between1 and 1 okay well by definition what that means is that the absolute value of sin x would always have to be less than or equal to one that's what an absolute value even means by definition okay well in fact it doesn't have to be sin x it be sign anything I don't care what you put in there as long as it's sign of something then the absolute value of sign of whatever is going to be less than or equal to one show fans feel okay with that one well we're going to change this then we go okay well cool well then what this thing does is this leads us to this statement well if the S 2N in terms of absolute value is less than one if I divide both sides by n 2 which I can do because n's positive so n squ is positive obviously then we have this statement what we know right now is that the series Let's see we know that the series of this sequence this sequence is always less than or equal to 1 n^2 what do we know about the series from n = 1 to Infinity of 1/ n² tell me something about that why are we doing that it's a p okay tell me something about the P series converges when what happens is p greater than one here so we say something about that we go okay this is a p series we say the p is two that's greater than one therefore this thing converges then we keep on going now okay we we're doing a lot of thing can you see that we're doing more than one test here we can do several tests within one problem we're doing two tests right now we're doing absolute convergence last we did Divergence test first we're doing absolute convergence okay cool well if we do absolute convergence then we can make this claim sign's always between 1 and one therefore absolute value of sign's always less than or equal to one therefore absolute value of sign 2N is less than or equal to 1 okay well if that's true then absolute value sin 2N / n^2 is less than or equal to 1 over N2 since I know the series of 1 over n s is a p series since p is 2 this this series the series of this sequence here is going to converge tell me something about this series then by what okay so by the comparison test this series also converges almost done we're not quite done but we're almost done I want to see if you guys are okay getting down this far so we we start with a series that we really don't have an alternating series test for we don't have much to do here we don't have comparison test or comparison test because that's not always positive we can't do it so all right we'll just take an absolute value of it we do an absolute value of this thing we start drawing some comparisons We compare this to 1/ n s well what that means is that because this series is series because this series can converges and our series with the absolute value of it is always less than that this series must also converge now go back to our original we're not back to our original yet so go back to our original what's it say about this s we don't stop here all You' said here is that this series converges that's true but is that your given series go back to your given series what's it say about this series then it converges use the correct terminology it can say what now converges AB not conditionally converges absolutely absolutely it's absolutely convergent why is it actually convergent well when you took an absolute value of it the series converges therefore this is absolutely convergent does that make sense to you therefore our series that was given to us this s of 2N n^2 you always want to make some statement about your original series okay you don't want to just go down here and says uh convergence that didn't tell me anything what what are you talking about this one this one what are you talking about here we're doing several things you got to work it back to make some statement about your original series we're always trying to say whether this thing diverges or converges uh absolutely or is conditionally convergent that's the idea here so therefore here it is one more time okay did we know anything about this one by itself no we had to take an absolute value okay take an absolute value well within the absolute value we're going to be using a comparison test the comparison test said because it's a PC P less than p p greater than one and our series here with the absolute values around it is always less than this one well because this converges then this converges by the comparison test no problem now this is not the series Series this is this series with absolute values around it therefore because this series converges we say that this series is absolutely convergent show hands if that madees sense to you now absolute convergence is about the strongest thing we can do right now okay so if we say it's absolutely convergent that's the strongest we say that it's definitely it's definitely convergent so we'll say absolute convergent and then be done therefore this series is absolute absolutely convergent if I say it's absolute convergent because I had to take absolute value to show convergence here that's the strongest thing we do at this point show fans feel okay with with that one for real okay good now there we go by the way if a Series has all positive terms that absolute convergence doesn't really help us all that much it's just another test for convergence because you'd have to use something else within that what absolute convergence says is this if there's no known test that you have right now it's not alternating try to doing the absolute value because that's the strongest thing you can do anyway but then that's going to show you possibly you could be absolute convergent all right now we have two tests that incorporate this absolute convergence this is the first one I told you about it at the opening uh the first one's called the ratio test it's one of my favorite tests it's a very powerful test we're going to look at that right now are there any questions before we we get going on that okay oh sorry ratio test first so ratio test here's the ratio test says it says if you make a ratio between your next term and the given term so basically on your sequence you'd have a subn + 1 and a subn if you make a ratio between them so if dot dot dot if the limit of the ratio between your terms is less than one or the limit between your terms is greater than one or the limit between your terms equals one after you take an absolute value of it we get three different outcomes for our series and this is what's really nice it gives you a gives you an instant picture of whether you are convergent or divergent or well whether you have to do more work on this thing so here's how it works it says what I want you to do is I want you to compare the sequence from where you're getting your Series right here's your SE sequence here's the a subn term here's the a subn +1 term it's very easy to find this I'll show you exactly how to do it take that that comparison take that ratio please make sure you have it written correctly do not invert these two terms otherwise these are obviously going to be all wrong okay so make sure you have your next term over your current term your a subn plus one term over your a subn term in every single case if your ratio after you have done the ratio and done the absolute value and taken the limit if that limit exists and if it's less than one if that's now it's not going to be negative explain to me why it's not going to be negative absolutely you're absolutely right so if this is if it's less than one what we immediately know is that our series I'm not going to do that our series is absolute conversion if we have this limit of the absolute value of the ratio between these two terms and it's greater than one we know that our series is Divergent if we have the limit of the absolute value of these two terms as a ratio and it equals one it's inconclusive and then you'd have to try hopefully some other technique that that you haven't done already so this is the idea it's not hard to do it's really nice do you guys get the idea before we get going any further it's really straightforward honestly uh you do the a subn plus one term over the a subn term put absolute values around it that's what's given us the absolute part of this absolute convergence or straight up Divergent no problem or it's inconclusive which we'd have to do something else for let me give you uh let me give you an example just to illustrate this right now last chance for were any questions on on this one okay so here we go you know many of you might have noticed something right away with uh with this right here especially this one do you always need to do the Divergence test if you're going to do the ratio test you can if you want to but sometimes it gets pretty difficult to do especially with like factorials and powers of N and all sorts of stuff so what's nice about the ratio test is that if you can't do the Divergence test right away you remember the Divergence test right you do the limit if it equals z you keep going um if you can't do that or it's going to be really hard and you're doing the ratio test anyway skip it say I'm doing the ratio test it's going to show up as divergent if I do that does that make sense to you that's kind of nice here so it's a really powerful Test shows absolute convergence or Divergence this is the one that sucks though you do all the work you get one you go oh man I got to do something else anyway so that would be the issue let's start off with this one uh tell me something about that let's let's go through all of them okay what's the first thing that you would do here you would do you good because even with the the alternating series test that's part of it right so if I do this one is it is the limit of this sequence here is that equal to zero try some lals in your head this one's going to go down a power then down a power and then constant right this one's not this is going to be 2 to the n and then well Ln 2 2 to the n and then Ln 2^2 2 the N so this one's not going to decrease like that therefore this limit would equal zero does that make sense to you also uh well it's not a p series it's not a harmonic series it's not geometric it is alternating do you see it we already sh showed that the limit of that thing goes to zero is it decreasing oh yeah so right now if you wanted to you could use the alternating series test and show this is convergent show up hands if you you understood that you could show that right now if you wanted to I want to show you the the ratio test just illustrate on something that's a little simple so here's what we're going to do okay let's let's try to use the ratio test here what the ratio test does is it sets you up with the limit and puts absolute value around everything that's where we're going to get our absolute convergence here by the way do you understand that we might try to show absolute convergence with the ratio test rather than just convergence with alternating series test what's stronger absolute so if we show absolute convergence it for sure converges anyway we show it inherently with the alternating series test does the alternating series test show absolute convergence the first example today that we did said no it can show convergence but it can't show absolute convergence because some things aren't absolute convergence are converg in Alterna Series so here we go we're going to try to show absolute convergence with the ratio test the ratio test works this way it says what I want you to do is take this sequence from which we're getting our series and put an n + one everywhere if we put an n + 1 everywhere we get -1 to the N do you see what I'm getting n from n + 1 - one is going to be n we're going to get n + 1 2 + 1 over 2 n + 1 okay I really do need to show you feel okay with that so far that's about half of us are there any questions do you see where this is coming from one more time okay what we're trying to do is we're trying to get this right now this a subn +1 term the a subn plus1 term means hey go to your a subn plug in N plus1 so instead of n I'm going to have n+1 instead of n I'm going to have n plus one instead of n I'm going to have n + one now n + 1 - one is n question um couldn't you just drop the negative one in since it's absolute value we're going to talk about that next yeah it's a great idea and you can after you show me the absolute value okay so right now no you got to have it somewhere um but now what here's what you could do all right if you wanted to right off the bat we just talked about absolute convergence right and this is going to show us with the ratio test absolute convergence do you guys get me so right off the bat you could just go well let's do this let's do absolute value let's get rid of that and then do a ratio test it's going to work out exactly the same because all the absolute value does for you is get rid of the negatives doesn't do anything else so depends of that made sense so either way you want to do it I don't care the ratio test practically puts the absolute value in there anyway U so it kind of does it all in one fail swoo all righty that's a good question thanks for that one now over it says put that over the original sequence anyway well that's this thing so all you got to do is rewrite that so here's the main point okay do not invert this or reciprocate this fraction it's a complex fraction this always goes on your denominator don't put it on the numerator this thing just rewrite right here so -1 n -1 n^2 + 1 okay all over 2 to the N you know as a matter of fact um I kind of wrote my fraction poorly this really is one times the whole thing so if you want to be precise about it the way I wrote it you really should have some parentheses there uh that way we're not algebraically incorrect it's not going to matter for the next thing we're going to do here's why it's not going to matter for the next thing we do um like Devon said what's the absolute value going to do to this gone absolute value negative one or one is going to be one this thing gone as well so that's what's nice about the absolute value and like I said you can do it first right off the bat and get rid of it and then do the ratio test that's fine fine so we're going to have a limit and approaches Infinity I'm going to do a couple things here first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to get rid of my negative-1 to the NS second thing I'm going to do I'm going to take my complex fraction so ignore these okay these are going to be gone I'm going to take my complex fraction I'm going to multiply by the reciprocal is that okay with you yeah so we have n +1 s + 1 over 2 n + 1 * 2 N over n^2 + 1 this and then the reciprocal question true or false I can get rid of my absolute value right now true or false no false okay why is it false you can still have a negative up in there somewhere can I still have negative pop up in there somewhere where's n start is this ever going to be NE so if you want to put them here that's fine but are you ever going to get a negative here no here no here no do you need absolute value no no okay so at some point you should be able to drop those absolute values are you with me at some point does it make sense to you I know we're doing a lot here but I want to make sure that you are with me are there any questions on that at all so do you show up hands if you feel okay about where this came from a ratio test are you okay that negative ones they're gone absolute value hey gone that's why we're doing this to get rid of that stuff no problem uh reciprocate by multiply by reciprocal not a big deal can we simplify this thing yeah first The Next Step you know I'm going to get rid of the absolute value not an issue we just talked about that what simplifies here two the two to the end simplify you need to know this is going to happen an awful lot on your ratio test an awful lot you see when you have this 2 the N plus one you're going to get a lot of plus ones aren't you well understand that this is really 2 the n * 2 that's really what that is does that make sense to you so instead of instead of this one I don't want I don't want that I'm look at this one the two to the ends are gone those simplify what I'm left with is just two does that make sense do you understand that 2 the n + 1 is 2 the n * two because when you multiply common bases you add exponents and that has a power one right there this is this you can simplify two to the end with a two to the end and then we have just two left just a little algebra but I want make sure you see it let's keep going well that means we got a limit as n approaches Infinity I'm going to drop the absolute value cuz everything's positive anyway it's not really relevant for us I'm going to distribute this thing this will be N2 + 2 n + 2 over this will be 2 n^2 + 2 I want I want you to verify the algebra on your own make sure that I'm right on this thing am I right you sure you're okay with that one so this sayy that's two no problem this is a great simplification for us we distribute that you get 2 n+ 2 this one distribute no problem combine some like terms there and we got that now tell me something about oh my gosh this is an easy limit this is a good one what's this limit perfect why is it 1/2 I don't care how you do it you do l call rule you can do whatever you want with this uh that's going to be 1/2 you can divide by large powerometer understand that limits are always about leading terms you get have whatever you want to do that's not what I'm trying to teach you here what I'm trying to teach you is what's that result say go back to your ratio test if the ratio if the limit of the absolute value of the ratio is less than one or greater than one or equal to one we have three different results the worst one is inconclusive right these ones I don't we really don't care what we have as long as we have one answer right it fits one of these models what does that tell you about our original series absolutely conver it's absolutely conversion that's right if that limit is less than one we know our series is absolute conversion so what we're going to say is so by the ratio test are you getting the picture that whenever I tell some whenever I say something I'm saying buy this byy that blah blah blah blah blah we're we're stating what we used we're saying by the comparison test because this is a p series it's absolute conversion because we did the ratio test here and it showed this and this was less than one by the ratio test the series from one to Infinity of whatever I gave you to start with is absolutely convergent and that's really nice that's really it's a nice I don't say easy test there's a lot there's a lot to it right but it's definitely not that hard if you know how to use it uh would you like to see at least let's do like two more examples you guys good with that yeah let's do some examples then any questions is it straightforward enough for you question this kind of be like our goto test for most oh yeah I love this test now you I'm I'm not going to say go to because sometimes I mean they're so easy that you just like a telescoping no all right or like a geometric that you can see it's geometric no P series you see p series obviously not no alternating series some yeah you might do it for that um I'm going to give you some hints at the last part of this lesson it's not going to be today but I'm going to go through like when you should use what I'm going to do a complete recap of all this stuff and that's going to be kind of nice for you uh when you use the ratio test typically here's a little preview when you have factorials especially factorials it's like number one okay factorials and when you have powers of of n that's usually when you do this is this the only way to prove uh absolute convergence or taking the limit of no we did it without this so that can that prove it though is that a test can you you can prove well absolute conversion simply means when I take the absolute value of a series and it converges my verion series absolute conversion the ratio incorporates that into it which is why when I do the absolute value it's not just converion oh it's absolutely okay so let's go at the series from one to Infinity of n Over N to the N just joking insert a little humor there uh now let's look at it all right let's look at this first thing I want you to notice tell me something about the Divergence test would you want to do that here no I wouldn't either because n factorial of n then I don't I don't know man it's probably zero I guarantee it is because this thing is going to I think it's converges uh this is going to converge but would we want to show it probably not uh what right there you go let me do the ratio test why why would I want to do the ratio test here factorial factorials and it's so nice with the ratio test you're going to see why it's nice in just a minute let's just look at other things real quick is it a p series geometric telescoping no no uh harmonic no is it something that I would want to do an integral test on no no comparison test maybe we could possibly U here's why I say that are they all positive terms yes MH they are which means the absolute convergence well it's just going to be another test for convergence for us what's great though the ratio test doesn't care about that the ratio test just says hey I'm going to tell you whether you're ABS convergent or Divergent you don't need to do the Divergence test the ratio test so it'll be in there somewhere does that make sense so that's kind of cool let's do the ratio test and see how this thing plays out so ratio test said and you can even write by ratio test so ratio test says do a limit as n approaches Infinity set up an absolute value even though right now we know it's all going to be positive okay we still set up the absolute value because the ratio test does at least showed on the first step after that yeah they're positive terms get rid of it no big deal let's set it up first so so you get in the habit of it it would stck to you know get in the habit of not writing it and then need it here oh man you don't want to do that now let's see if you guys can fill out the numerator of our complex fraction and the denominator so I'll give you about 10 seconds see if you can get here and here go for [Applause] it the denominator should be really easy because the denominator is exactly what this says that's it that's our a subn the numerator takes a little more work but not much this is going to be n + 1 factorial over n + 1 use parentheses where appropriate to the n + 1 show hands if you got exactly that so everywhere you see an N you should put n plus one that's that's all it is now let's talk about this for real are the absolute values relevant is that positive is that positive then this whole thing is so let's drop the absolute value also with the ratio test you're always going to get a complex fraction you're typically going to get a complex fraction usually with us um so if we get a complex fraction we're going to create a division problem and multiply by the reciprocal to undo that complex fraction so we'll have n +1 factorial Over N +1 to the N +1 times what's going to be next did I tell you you guys are going to get a lot of n plus1 Powers what typically happens here is you'll have to split off one of those powers like we did with the two like we're going to do with this thing so don't let this confuse you we're just going to split one off just break it off strip it off there oops so we got limit no problem we're going to have an N +1 factorial we're going to have an N to the N we're going to have an N factorial and then we're going to strip off 1 power of n + 1 we're going to strip one of those things off so we're going to put n + one to the n and we're going to strip one off we're going put that little stripper right here n + one oh come on that was funny just joking do you understand that this really is n +1 to the n + one power yeah this is a power one right common bases if you multiply common bases you add exponents that is this thing okay well that's not not bad that'll help us out in just a little bit so what now oh goodness gracious simplify can we simplify that do you understand what n +1 factorial is do you know that n +1 factorial is the same thing as n +1 time what's oh what's the next term n n oh times this would be n minus one oops all the way down to one does that make sense to you tell me what this is therefore by your own little l here not little I don't mean to me you by your own logic uh this is the same thing as n +1 * n factorial let's see if you can wrap your brains around that does that make sense to you if this means n times all everything previous to it and I multiply by n + 1 that gives me n +1 factorial this is n +1 * n factorial n+ 1 * n factorial that is the idea show fans feel okay with that one get used to it you're going to do that a lot okay so let's uh let's go here so what I'm going to do is I'm write the limit and we're going to have n + 1 * n factorial over this guy we had n + 1 to the n * n + 1 this guy was n to the N this is n factorial do you see any things that can simplify now by the way everything we're doing right here is algebra there's no calculus involved right now it's all algebra it's understanding that this is a complex Frac in fact even doing this this is the only calculus you really really do besides taking a limit of the very end you're going to do some some it's not going to be that easy uh to do the some of the limits but calculus here all algebra to simplify that's really it understanding that that's a complex fraction no problem understanding this right here is n + 1 * n factorial that's a big deal understanding this is n +1 to the n * n +1 okay these two don't change at all let's see what we can simplify give me something n factorial is gone oh that's a huge deal those are gone what else n+ 1 that was important too so what we end up with is a limit as n approaches Infinity of n the N over n + 1 to the N you see the idea here that I was trying to get to was two terms which have the same power did I get that simplify as much as I can I got that well then if they do have the same power I can get n/ n + 1 to the end we're almost home almost done now this is where it gets a little weird right um I want you to think of this for a second I want to open your memory banks here right now folks hopefully you have some cash to withdraw from otherwise your memory banks are whatever um plug in Infinity what do you get no you don't what do you get in here L one you get one this is one this is infinity you get one to the infinity that's an indeterminate form remember indeterminate forms when you had a one to Infinity oh this is this is this this is where we went oh let's do e to the limit of Ln of bunch of junk do you remember that and then we did a bunch of junk because you move your power forward you create a fraction you use lal's rule all right you're going to have to do things like this now I'll give you a couple hints most of the time what we like are fractions that you can split apart we don't like n Over N plus one we like n plus one over n so when we do that maybe do a couple nice little tricks here do something like this do the n + 1/ n now does anyone know about this if you reciprocate a fraction what happens to that becomes negative this becomes negative n which means I can write this as 1/ n + 1 / n to the N now I'm GNA cheat okay I'm not cheating I already I did on the side uh I'm not going to reshow you this this limit from n to Infinity of n + 1/ n to the N this do I have time do you guys want to see it be like a minute two minutes over U but here it is firstly do you understand it's one to the infinity okay that's bad news what that means is we do e limit n approaches Infinity of bunch of junk to the N with an Ln in front of it that allows us to move our n forward for the sake of time I'm going to not write uh just that little part when we have that this is now an infinity times sorry that's Ln times one okay so we're going to have to redo that one so that's e to the Limit Ln of n + 1 n all over 1 n now we can do a ly talls with this thing so if we do a ly t with this we're going to have e to the Li 1 n + 1 n * -1 n 2 all over1 N2 the Der of this is this the Der of this is this you're going to have to follow me care are you guys with me on that one I know I'm doing it fast well this is kind of nice cuz those are completely gone so this is e to the limit of 1 over if I divide both these I get 1 + 1 in remember that n is approaching Infinity what's one over infinity 1+ 0 one over 1 e to the 1 that limit is e therefore this thing right here so this was just its own little own little guy what that says is that the limit I didn't mean I didn't really want to show that but now that you have it I'm sorry what's the limit of this thing this is one Reas now tell me something about one over e that is less than one this is less than one and so we're going to finish this thing off um what what test did we do let's talk about our original series tell me something about the ratio test was it conclusive did we get anything out of it when is the ratio test not conclusive very good this thing wasn't equal to one therefore we have some conclusion uh the fraction the ratio was it less than one or greater than one what's it tell you about our series you're absolutely right what I want to know is if that makes sense to you okay let me ask you a different question did it make sense up to this part show hands if it did okay were you able to follow that one that's old stuff all right so you got to this is uh the section where we did the iner of limits you might have to do that Within part of it understand you can take a piece of this do the limit put it back and then follow up with that ratio test you guys okay with that with one more example then I'll do a recap next time all right here we are so let's do our last example of using the ratio test uh then we'll talk about the root test and finally a recap of everything that we've done in our series thus far so getting started uh first things first what's the first thing that you would probably do here alter you could try lots of things here this this is going to alternate for sure um I probably might just jump straight to the ratio test because we have that negative up there because we know it's nice and Because unless it's inconclusive it gets gives us the result that we want either divergent or convergent you see some of those other tests they don't they don't do that uh some of them are just well if it does this then it's this this one says well we have three outcomes we have absolutely convergent which means it's definitely convergent we have Divergent which you're done anyway or it's inconclusive if it's if you get listen on your homework and stuff they're going to ask you for a couple things right they're going to ask you for whether this series is absolutely convergent conditionally convergent or Divergent does that make sense if you want to check for absolute convergence you have to do an absolute value which means you're probably going to use the ratio test at some point so how you go ahead and do those those problems you start with a ratio test or the root test which we're going to use you start with that if it works out to hey it's less than one you know you're absolutely convergent you're done that's stronger than convergence if it works out to fraction greater than one no problem you're done it's Divergent no need to go any further if it works out to one then you start using another test after that question now what if it's Infinity that's over one that would be over one yeah but or if it's zero so it counts as absolutely okay yeah okay so let's uh let's start here let's try the ratio test on this thing so first thing with the ratio test is what what do we do with the ratio test we look at me blankly it's a good start uh what do we do with the ratio test how do we start that thing off okay it's a limit that's very good so we got a limit a limit as of what that's right in fact I think I told you this last time if you wanted to could you do the absolute value here and then compare the ratio yeah the absolute values are going to take all those negatives away anyway make all positive terms so you could do that as well most people just do it all in one step the way that I'm going to do it uh by the way what goes on the main numerator of this complex fraction we're creating is it the a subn or the a subn plus one so we're going to write that so a sub I'm a little crooked here a sub n + 1 and we're going to be real careful about it what what's our a subn + 1 how would that look okay to the what very good and then what and then what perfect we'll end those absolute values on the main denominator it's just a subn again so it's -5 to the nus1 it's N2 and 3 n now what would you do if this was your problem on a test what would you do here remove remove how would I remove the absolute value how would I do that sure so look at you can do that actually right now if you really want to if you did the absolute value of5 to the N you're going to get 5 to the end what you can't do is just say well when I take the absolute value that just goes away like my -1 to the end that that you can't do you guys see the reason why so the reason why this actually works is5 to the end is the same thing as -1 * 5 the N which the same thing as-1 to n * 5 n which means that yeah okay you can get rid of the negative but you can't get rid of the five to the end are you sure you're okay with that okay so we can do that now as well also what I want to leave it as this complex fraction I did is that oh no so I'm going to drop the absolute value that means I'm going to get rid of my negatives I am not going to get rid of the N or the five I'm not going to get rid of the nus one or the five I need those things and I'm also going to instead of having the complex fraction we'll have one fraction times the reciprocal of our other fraction so here we'll have 5 to n over n + 1^ 2 * 3 n + 1 * what's going to be on our numerator here all over perfect yeah exactly right why would it be five your absolute our absolute value would take care of all that stuff so no more negatives what now stop simp simplify simplify as much as we can tell me some things that simplify yeah okay so if we have 5 to the nus one we have 5 to the N how much do we have left and where does it go do you understand that what 5 to the N really is is 5 N - 1 * * 5 do you guys get that so if this is 5 n -1 * 5 then the 5 n -1 would simplify and we would have five left are you sure you're okay with that it's just algebra but I want to make sure that you're you're all right yes no guys over here are you okay with that one okay moving on what else what else simplifies come on quickly we got to move on this stuff what else the threes okay so we got 3 to the N we got 3 the n + 1 understand that 3 the n+ + 1 is really 3 n * 3 well if this is 3 n * 3 what can I simplify out of that three to the ends are gone what's remaining three okay I'm going to move over here just so I can write this a little bit nicer so we have a limit as n approaches Infinity of let's check this out we've got well first we got a five and we got a three so we got a 5/3 we've got an n^2 over n + 1 2 quick show hands if you're okay with that one so far okay next up notice how the n and n plus one both have the same power let's make them one fraction to that power so we'll have a limit n approaches Infinity of 5/3 * n / n + 1 squared hey tell me what's going to happen here what would you get what happens to our our limit as n approaches to Infinity we get one the whole thing's one let's let's go part by part okay how much is the limit of n/ n + one that's one do you understand why that's one you could divide everything by n if you wanted you could do low talls on the inside of that if you wanted either way that's going to be one how much is 1 squar 1 s is 1 * 5/3 is 5 that's a horrible 5/3 now tell me something if the limit of the absolute value of the ratio between my N subn A subn + 1 and my a subn term equals 53 is that a conclusive result for this ratio test is it conclusive or inconclusive inclusive it's definitely conclusive it tells us something now you got to know what it tells us inconclusive would be when that equals to yeah then you got to do something else all right you don't know anything about that but this one equals 5/3 is that bigger than one or less than one what's that tell you about our series that we got I don't care about absolute de there no such thing it's just Divergent okay I don't want you to say absolutely Divergent because that's that's that sounds weird all right um if you say absolutely Divergent you could mean it's not absolutely listen care it sounds trivial but it's not okay if you say it's absolutely Divergent that's kind of weird because well does that mean that it's just simply not absolutely convergent but it might be convergent that's called conditionally convergent or do you mean that it's Divergent altogether there's there's no absolutely Divergent there's absolutely convergent there's conditionally convergent where it does not absolutely converge but does converge and there's Divergent so according let's say properly what's this one do according to what test so we say Hey by the ratio test test the series that we had to start with Divergence and that is the whole thing for the ratio test show hands feel okay with the ratio test okay our last are there any questions at all before we go is it pretty straightforward to you question just want you to go over that how the how that 5 nus 1 * 5 equal 5 n like I'm so how much what's the power here one add the powers oh because of the absolute the negative disar n if you add 1 plus nus one you get n okay last test last one aren't you excited I'm kind of excited the last one we've done so many of them the last one last one we're going to fa least is called the root test use the root test if you have nth powers in your series now we talked about the ratio test right I said you use that ratio test if you have factorials or nth powers in your Series so what that means is there's like a crossover a lot of times you can not a I don't know some of the times you can use both of these tests either one of them you can use the ratio test or you can use a root test it just depends on which one's going to be easier for you what I would not recommend is using the root test if you have factorials use the ratio test for that so when the root test is typically used is for a series involving n powers what's really nice about the root test is that after you've covered the ratio test the outcomes are very straightforward so here's what we do if we take a limit starts up exactly the same way as the ratio test we're star with a limit if we take our our Ser well our sequence from which we get our series and we take an absolute value of it do you notice something that's different about this test versus the ratio test already what's different about it is there a fraction at all there is no ratio because this is not a ratio test all right this is this is a root test so instead of creating a ratio we're going to create a root root so here's how it works we take the sequence itself the the main advantage here is that you don't have to have a really large well I erased the board but a really large fraction out of this one there's no such thing it's just the the sequence from where we get our series the ace sub n then you take an absolute value of it and then you take an nth root of it what's nice is that if this thing exists I'm try to make this a little clearer if that limit exists so we start with our sequence no problem take an absolute value of it no problem take an nth root of it and then we take a limit as n approach Infinity if this limit exists and is less than one it has the same result as if the ratio test were less than one what's it going to tell you about our series absolutely that's very good it's absolutely convergent what about if the limit is greater than one what do you think [Music] yeah what about if the limit equals one what do you think same results you guys okay with the root test probably not yet right you want to see an example let's do an example here real fast just one of them to give you an idea about how you can do this again I'll make the statement one more time can you use the ratio test for sometime you could use a root test can use the root test or sometimes you could use the ratio test yeah you can a lot there's a lot of crossover there right again what I wouldn't recommend don't try this if you get factorials it the ratio test is really nice for factorials because when you just add one to a factorial most of that stuff is gone make sense so keep that in mind let's try one example just to show you how it works and then I'll do that recap I've been promising you so let's start with this series you know a lot of times students have questions how do you know what test to use what do you start with well you start with firstly you know what I'd start with through all our process and see what's going to be the easiest thing for us to do in each case um I know that's alternating do you guys know that's alternating yes is it going to be easy to show that it is decreasing or to show that the limit equals zero no those aren't going to be easy things to do so I probably wouldn't do an alternating series it's not a p series it's not a geometric series it's not a telescoping Series so the first thing we come to is like well all right uh integral test no it's not I don't no that's not all positive terms you can't even do it compar test no it's not all positive terms you can't even do it so you what you could do you could take the absolute value of the whole thing and then try one of those couldn't check you can do that and then try a comparison test then try integral test but those things look pretty hard for this one because we have to show decreasing for both of them for integral test and comparison test that wouldn't be a good sorry uh for integral test and for alternating series test you have to show decreasing comparison test well you'd have to figure out what this is smaller than then show convergence or bigger than then show Divergence probably the quickest way to go about one of these ones because it has the absolute value already is the ratio test or the root test you with me and I believe both of them would work um but I'm going to show you why you Pro you might want to choose I don't know I haven't tried the ratio test on that one maybe you can try to and see if it actually does work uh maybe I'll do that later too I would try the root test and here's why I try the root test what I'm seeing is that I have this to a power N I have this to kind of a power N I can make it a power n so if I take an nth root those things are going to go away the absolute value is going to make this thing go away does that make sense so let me show you how the root test Works root test says hey take simple limit n goes to infinity and nth root of the absolute value of whatever you have here you don't need to do an N plus one which is kind of nice you don't have to create a ratio or do anything or change this sequence where we get our series from in any way shape or form and already we can start working with it so let's go through it one time firstly show up hands if you're okay getting from here to here using the root test are you okay with where that's coming from it's nth root it's absolute value it's the same exact thing you got now let's work on it uh absolute value of negative 1 to any power what's going to happen with this thing that's gone completely gone so we got a limit and approach Infinity yeah it's still an nth root but this the absolute value of1 to any power is one so this piece is gone now 2 n + 3 when you're doing the root test you're trying to match up your powers so if I have 2 n + 3 I'm not going to write that as 2 n+ 3 again what I'm going to write is 2 3 * 2 to the N are you okay on algebra with that mm that still 2 the n + 3 that's exactly what that is by the way um if you would have had like 2 the nus 3 2 N minus 3 you can change this to 2 the N that's not even that's not even n come on Leonard wor it times 2 the -3 couldn't you do that yes that would just go to the denominator and be 2 the 3r so don't get stuck on this and go oh my gosh I can't do it well yeah you can just separate off that negative exponent move it to a denominator and then it's that simple does that make sense to you so don't get all hung up on that all over n + 1 to the N now let's try to make this all have one power if we can so here we get 2 the N we get n plus 1 the end we get 23 23 I'm not worried about here's why I'm not worried about that I can separate products when they're inside of any sort of a root so I can separate this as 2 3 * 2 n + one to the N furthermore because I've separated this I can make this a limit as n approaches Infinity of the nth root of 2 3r time the nth root of all this jump 2 n + 1 to the N power now here's what I'm going to ask you do you see why I tried to get these two things to have the same power do you see why the idea is if I can make them have the same power I can do this with it what's the nth root out of something raised to the nth power what's going to happen there they're gone so we get a limit as n approaches Infinity of by the way do you know this I know you know it um when you have a a root out of something ra to a certain power we get the base to the power over the root did you know that yes times 2 over n +1 let's consider that let's see about n going to Infinity uh so you tell me what's 3 over n when n goes to Infinity can we do that Z what's two to the Z okay so this is one times uh what's two oh how about that one what's uh what's n as n to Infinity this whole okay the whole thing you guys are better than that aren't you two over this what is that zero what's 1 time Z okay is that conclusive or inconclusive when is the only time a ratio or root test is inconclusive is this equal to one then there's a conclusion here uh is this greater than one or less than one hopefully yeah so what does that tell you about this series is this series absolute convergent inconclusive or Divergent what is it very good so we say it by the root test we tell me what we're doing our original series here is one more time if the result you get is less than one what do we say about our series absolutely that's exactly right quick show hands you feel okay with with that so far are you all right with that one so we go all right well what would work best here well probably not anything we've done before what's quickest what's nicest is a ratio test or a root test it'll give us a nice conclusive answer most of the time if it's one then you try something else in this case you go well what's going to be better for us a ratio test a root test root test probably because I have an n and an N I can make those have the same power I know that the root is eventually going to get rid of that and will have no problems with this results are the same for the root test as they are for the ratio test you sure you're okay with it now we've come a long way haven't we we've done a lot of stuff on this idea of series what I'd like to do now is give you a summary of everything we've done and when to use it that way when you get to your test or your homework or whatever you're doing man what am I supposed to do here maybe you can break this down like a little outline or or have this in your head what you should look for to make the problems as easy as possible any questions or comments or anything before we going on that would you like that little summary great like please well typically a book will have something like this in it I think ours does too uh but I would like to give you kind of my version of it as well things that you should be looking for so here's a [Applause] summary the number one thing we look for in any series number one thing we always test for in any series is if we can it's nice and easy we do the Divergence test we kind of skipped over that one on this one because what's nice about the ratio and the root test is it almost inherently does that because when you get down to here if you have something greater than one you know it dages anyway so it kind of does that for you which is nice but most of the time almost all the time we're going to do that Divergence test first so number one thing we check for is if the limit of a subn does not equal zero the series of a subn diverges this is what we call the Divergence test take a limit of that sequence from which we get our series and if that limit of that a subn does not equal zero you're done it differes number two we can also do series what I call what's matter inity say what what did I do shoot you know what I I thought about that zero I'm sorry mind was ahead of my hands so yeah you're right if n approaches Infinity that's right and a sub the limit of a sub n does not equal to zero our series diverges next one we got several types of series we dealt with so we can do this by type for instance if you know it's geometric yeah I'll just do it that so if we know it's geometric of that form remember this could be to the nth power as well when do this converge when when absolute value R is greater than one between negative 1 and one so the absolute value of R would be so if we know it's geometric stop don't do any ratio tests or root tests or anything harder than that it's geometric man make it geometric manipulate to fit this thing then we know it converges if your R AB bar is less than one also what's nice about geometric is there's a sum built into it the sum is a over 1 R it's a sum for us what else do we got oh yeah when does it diverge thanks a lot for the help on that one guys more than or at least one by the way if you check for should you do the sum first on a geometric or should you check for convergence or Divergence first convergence diverence if the geometric series diverges would you want to do this on a test I will Mark you down for that you say the sum is this no it's not it diverges so you can't tell the sum is okay don't do that okay next one um we had telescoping series for telescoping series the basic idea here is use partial fractions to get some s remember the partial fractions we did use partial fractions to get a a a partial sh so we start with partial fractions to get S of n that's our partial sum and then we take a limit of N S Sub n as n approaches Infinity we go okay here's here's what we have now now let's say this n goes to Infinity so we say here's our sum to a certain point move that point to infinity and we get whether this telescoping series converges or or diverges and we get a sum for of course I'm not reteaching all this we've already covered all this stuff I'm just kind of recapping okay okay last one by type last one by type the last type of series that we had was what oh no I'm sorry U kind of kind of different type like a named type like we had geometric we had telescope we had P series that's right so P series if we have 1 over n to the P that's a p series do you remember when a p series converges and when the P Series dages yeah it's easy to get these confused for some people who go oh man geometric great lesson one oh what what happens it's different for this one so a p series converges if I'm sorry what when do you say it converges if p is what and when does it diverge l or equal to that's what I was looking for where's the equal to go okay so what's one what's that going to be the equal to is it going to converge or aage that would be diverges you're exactly right if I have the equal to one that gives me the harmonic series we've already talked about how that diverges anything else greater than one well it's going to converge less than one it's going to diverge also we talked about this a while ago I'm not going to write down but you need know that a lot of times we can manipulate our series to fit in one of these so all of a sudden you know we might not have it immediately but we work on it a little bit we we end up getting a geometric or we end up getting a telescope and we end up getting a a p series and then if it's by type man this is really nice because it's super fast and for at least two of these we can find the sum for it the other ones we can't but for these two we can actually get the sum you okay with that so far yes so if you've done the diverence test and it passes and if it's not a specific type so it's not a geometric and it's not telescoping and it's not a p series the next thing you might want to look for or maybe some people skip over this one because they see well probably go to ratio test you might try the integral test integral test says that if you have a function I'm going to use some poor notation but I'm just going to do it anyway if you have a function that represents your sequence from where we get our series and the function is positive continuous and decreasing on an interval from 1 to Infinity actually you know what um this is a little bit of a not a mistake but kind of we don't need it from one to Infinity if you remember this we can add and subract the finite number of terms to our Series so even if it's not till like 3 to Infinity we had a couple of those problems right where it was okay started at three that's fine two it just has to be positive continuous and decreasing on some interval forever starting at a certain point some big n not little n but if we have that if we have that we can model our a function after some sequence we read our series and the function is positive continuous and decreasing on a certain interval then we can do the intergral test from wherever your interval starts to Infinity of course that will be an improper integral because we have one to Infinity here and what this says is that if this thing converges series converges if this thing diverges Series diverges so function positive continuous decreasing on an interval not a problem do an inter integral test from one wherever your interval starts to Infinity it's an improper integral if you find out that equals a number cool hey converges if it doesn't well hey diverges not a problem number four if we have a sequence a series from where all our terms are positive and the series acts like a p series or geometric or something else that we can do uh like a generally geometric P series or while harmonic is a p Series so if it acts like one we do a comparison test or limit comparison test we say hey this is smaller always smaller than something or it looks like another series kind of it has maybe missing one little piece to it we can do a comparison test or a limit comparison test for so when we did that we knew that if we could find another Ser another sequence really where every term of our given series was less than the known series if we if we know that and the series of B subn converges then the series of as suban also conver if a sub's bigger than b sub and a series of B suban diverges Ser series of as also Di and lastly this of course would be for the comparison test so comparison test says hey you know what if you know this if you know that every single term in your a subn is less than every single term in your B sub and the series of B sub converges as sub converges if this every term in as suben is bigger than or equal to every term in B subn and B subn diverges a sub is bigger than that it has to diverge this is for the compar test the last one's a limit comparison test says hey you know what if you take a limit of A subn over B subn don't get this confused the ratio test this is not the same thing uh the limit comparison test does this in with two different series here that look a lot alike okay so if this thing exists naturally uh these would both be positive terms okay so your limit would have to be positive as well if this thing exists then the series will have same result both convergent both Divergent okay I'm going to keep moving but you guys have any questions on this I'm going have to race this as we go unfortunately I'm short on wall space so are we okay with with this hello yes no should shouldn't be new stuff really should be old stuff but I want to make sure that you guys are okay on what I've written down which one do we do conversion to the soap number five okay number five for a series where we have -1 to n or1 to nus1 times some other sequence that has all positive terms that's your alternating series you know what this one should be pretty fresh you guys should tell me this is a two-part test part A what's part a li limit limit of what a and everybody what's it got to be equal to Z yeah that's practically the Divergence test again just part of it so limit got to be zero also Part B what else has to happen got to be decreasing that's right so the derivative of a function that's modeled after your sequence has to be negative negative mean decreasing or if you show this the next term is less than or equal to the previous term in other words if it's decreasing then the series converges so fro good on these ones the last two we just did so I'm not going to be kind of super explicit on the last two what I'm going to tell you is that on number six if you want to do ratio test here's when you should try the ratio test try the ratio test for factorials and N Powers by the way uh you guys know what the ratio test is right I don't want to kind of recap that we just did it it's is it a subn over a subn plus 1 or a subn plus 1 a subn and then we take an absolute value this will show you absolute convergence Divergence or inconclusive when is this going to be absolutely convergent when is L one when the ratio is when the limit of the ratio is less than one that's right so and if it's greater than one and if it's equal to one you have that in your notes somewhere right should be previously on the video actually number seven try the root test for n poers as I said before sometimes you can do either one of these tests and get the same result out of it now what I'd like to do for the rest of our time here I'm going to briefly I mean like so fast go through some of these problems just to give you an idea about how I would look at them and say oh you know what I'd try this here I would try this here we're not going to do hardly any any of them okay we're just going to look at it does that make sense to you y so let me write them all down and then we'll go through them very fast for [Applause] for for okay there we go I want to give you the rundown here because I think it's really important that you guys see this at least one more time do you have them all written down yes okay so let's go through it first thing we check for every time is always the Divergence test so on number one problem number one what's the first thing you you noticing up here the limit's going to equal 2/3 not equals z diverges it's that fast don't worry about looking at telescoping or anything else it's going to diverge does that make sense to you next one do you know you can separate separate series by addition or subtraction then in this case you'd have something that is well that's a geometric this is geometric with two 1/3 to the N do you see it yes this you need partial fractions that's going to be telescoping so you get geometric and you have telescoping both of them would have to converge in order for the series to converge you with me okay so this is geometric and telescoping next one well we go okay geometric no telescoping no but this can look like a p series make them into a type of series if you can Divergence test cool geometric no no problem can make it geometric telescoping partial fractions for telescoping here we have one to the okay this is a p Series where p is greater than one that thing is going to converge it can be that fast next one for something like this well it's really easy to see that this is always positive it's always continuous for n greater than three as it says right here it's always decreasing we don't even have a numerator besides one and the integral would be really easy easy because if you use a substitution substitution of = Ln of n gives you 1 n it's right there this is going to be U2 and then we do an integral of that so integral test for this one next up that one well here's the difference between these two what you should do and when you should do them a lot of times when you have single you see what I'm saying about single terms there's not multiple terms here when you have single terms do a comparison test this will be less than < TK n over N2 do a comparison test with that this would be n to the three Hales this is a p series p is uh greater than one it's going to converge therefore because it's always less than that by the comparison test this series also converges does that make sense to you so comparison test here when you have more than one term it's really hard to do this because you don't know what's less than you don't know what's greater than because you have these other terms being added on or subtracted that's really hard does that make sense so with single terms maybe try just the comparison test because it's way easier okay with multiple terms you're going to look at what it looks like how it behaves how it behaves is with the leading terms so we base it on this one then we take a limit of A subn over B subn and we do the limit comparison test we okay with that one are you are you guys sure am I going too fast for you okay next up this is just straight up automatically what Alterna series just do Alterna series t with that it's really easy to see that it is decreasing it's really easy to see that the limit is going to be zero alternating series test and you're done with this one you actually have an option you can do either the root test or the ratio test with this it doesn't matter so pick either one of this the root test is a little tricky because you have to make n be something to the N power power it's possible it's just not easy to do well it's not super hard to do uh you can do this n the 1 is the same thing as n to the N / n which is the same thing as n the 1 n to the N it looks weird but you can do that and that way you'd have this this ratio appropriately uh the last one when you get down to something like this please do not start doing weird things like a ratio test or root test when you have a sign in there already is that going to work out for you no it's not alternating so when you have something with a sign or a cosine or something like this do the absolute value first because as soon as you do the absolute value so use absolute value as soon as you do that then you can say well the absolute value of sign is always less than or equal to one does that make sense and then you have this comparison test idea so try absolute value and then you'll be able to use one of these other test I'm put then dot dot dot use something else use a comparison test um did this help you at all this summary show P if you feel okay with that one okay so this will hopefully give you an idea about what you can do uh this is every test that we've done there's a lot of tests but now you have at least the an outline did this section make sense for you all right 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 9.7:  Power Series, Calculus of Power Series, Ratio Test for Int. of Convergence
okay so moving on to where the rubber hits the road why we dealt with the series in the past few sections is because we want to talk about power series and what these things are so real quick brief explanation of what a power series is what a power series is is a series with some variable in it not like n but like X like our typical variables that's being raised to some power that's why we call it a power series because we have a variable raised to some power let me let me uh write that down and explain what they would look like so a power series it's simply a series with a variable X that is being raised to some power and that power is based on N now what we're going to talk about in this class are two types of power series we're going to talk about power series centered at zero and we're going to talk about power series centered at some constant C so there's two types we talk about um other than the fact they're centered different places there's really not any difference between them so there's two types of power series Power series series number one power series number one looks like this it's a and this is going to look very interesting to you because you've never seen it before it's a series we start them at zero so the first term starts at n equals 0 typically and what it's going to look like is well that would be just a normal series wouldn't it just a subn something like uh I don't know n^2 over NB + 1 that's a that's a type of a subn or or whatever we we've had many of them Ln over of n whatever we had a lot of different types of sequences from where we get our series now for a power series the difference between what we've done before and what we've done what we're doing now is instead of just having this we also have a variable raised to some power that's what's giving this this idea of a power series it's now have has a variable in it does it make it harder or easier just different it's it's going to use a lot of the same Concepts that you already know we're still going to be doing things like the ratio test and absolute conversion and all sorts of that stuff we had to have that and you're going to see why as we go through this section okay so when we get down to checking for end points when we get down to radius of convergence when we get down to finding out whether these are convergent or not we're using the same tests okay it's all the same stuff so we had to have all that so that we could accomplish this section so let's talk about what this would look like just the first couple terms how it's going to look what where do we start these uh these power Series so if I plugged in zero well I don't know what this is explicitly but I know it's going to be a sub Z true yeah and it would be x to the 0 what's x to the 0 so our first term is simply going to be a sub Z you with me on that one yeah we're going okay plus it's not alternating typically unless we have something in our a subn that makes it alternate plus I would plug in one and I would get x to the good and then I would plug in two and I would get x to the second I'd plug in three and get x to the 3 and so on and so forth forever and ever and ever and ever because this thing stops at Infinity you guys okay with that so far yeah now just a little heads up I want you to think about functions do functions ever stop no functions going into so right now what we're doing here is we're actually defining a function which is interesting I will'll talk about that in a minute so number two the other type of power series you can have is one that's centered oh you know what I forgot to tell you a little something I mentioned it but I want to write it down for you to make sure you have it what this is this is a power Series in the variable X which is centered at the origin the origin would be our zero I said centered at zero centered at origin you can use them interchangeably this is centered at zero or centered at the origin so this is a power series in X which is our variable this means it's a power series based on the variable X which is centered at the origin or zero why is it centered at zero or centered at the origin why is it centered there I want you to look at the x is anything being added or subtracted from the X so zero is being added or subtracted from the X nothing's being added or subtracted therefore it's centered at the origin or centered at zero quick head on if you're okay with that one compare to this suppose I had a series starting at zero never ending a subn x - c to the N of course the first few terms are going to look really similar to this let's check that out and then we'll consider the differences between our our series themselves if if I plugged in zero I'd still get a sub 0 I'd still get x - c but this is going to be raised to the 0 power what's anything raised to the 0 power so it starts out exactly the same do you see y mhm plus I'd still have a sub one but this time instead of having x to the 1st I'm going to have x - c to the 1st and instead of having a sub 2 * x 2 I'm going to have x - c to the 2 other than that there's not any change to it it's just where this thing is centered so that little C that says xus C that c is what your Center is so if I have minus three we're centered at three if I have plus two we're centered at2 did you catch that are you sure because it's minus C so minus negative would make that plus for us so anyway uh we have a power Series in X still but this is centered at C where C is it it's a constant now of course I'm going to give you some examples in a little while and we'll talk much more about this uh as we go through but for right now we're not going to work with these things I just want to give you examples of how they look would you guys like a couple examples of how these things look real quick please okay so here's an example just for a few terms we'll see what these things are doing and of course we'll talk a lot about them as we move forward you know the first thing I want to know I want to know if you can tell that this is going to be a power series just by looking at it can you tell it's going to be a power series just by looking at it yes what's it got there that none of our series before is yeah it's a variable being raised to power that's a power series now quick question do you think this is going to be centered at zero or centered at some other number centered at the origin or not what do you think does it look like number one or number two looks definitely like number one because we have nothing being added or subtracted to our X itself if it's not centered at the origin it's going to be x minus or X plus something now you have you understand that okay also can can you pick out my a subn from here can you pick out my a subn what is it just cover that up and that's a subn that's it so this is the the sequence right and then after that we're getting our series from and then after every term we're just tacking on an x x to the 0 x to the 1st x to the 2 x that's what's given us our power Series so really if we wanted to do this we could write out just the sequence here and put x to the 0 x to the 1st x to the 2 x the 3D after every single those terms and we'd have the appropriate series now of course we're going to do this all at one time but let's let's try it just for the first few terms uh where do I start again Z let's plug in zero what's netive 1 to the zero one so we're going to have one what's x to the 0o one and what's Z factorial one one Z factorial is defined to be one if you didn't know that it's one so our first term here is one you okay with that so far next term let's plug in one if we plug in one what's 1 to the one so I know I'm going to be subtracting hey what type of a power series is this Alterna Alterna yeah that's right so how about uh plug in one here we get x to the over over what over one over one factorial you can put the one factorial here if you just want to see the pattern okay so right now we just have X but if you put one factorial you're going to see the pattern in just a minute next one is it going to be plus or everybody sure and what we'll get is X over good minus X 3r over 3 factorial plus and do you see the pattern it's easy to see the pattern once you get the first few terms that right there is the first few terms of our power series let me give you the next one I'll make a couple SATs about this I do want you to understand that this thing is centered at the origin there though have I made that very clear for you so it's a power series no problem cuz you got X to a variable you notice how the variable here is 1 2 3 blah blah blah blah blah it's going to continue continue we have it centered at zero because nothing's being added or subtracted from our X now compared to this next one what's that going to do for us okay okay it might look a little nasty but don't worry about that right now we're just going to kind of talk about this one for a second um first thing you notice what type of a series is this is this a power series what tells it's a power series variable it's a variable it's being raised to a power now let's see is this more like the number one or more like the number two so is this centered at the origin where is it centered very good do you understand why it's not centered at negative 4 xus that's right it's x minus the center just like finding a root like if you did xus 2 the root of a a polinomial xus 2 means your x intercept is at two so that positive two you can think about like always a changing sign well it's not really it's defined to be x minus your Center so the center is Pi / 2 if I had had X oh my God sorry I said Pi 2 I meant Pi 4 if I had X+ Pi 4 the center would be at very good exactly right so let's figure out a few terms here what's the first thing we plug in everybody zero so if we plug in zero we're going to get let's see here here's one plug in zero here oh wait so am I going to start with n oh that's that's going to be different than we had before so this actually does something here so don't just automatically assume we start at one all the time that doesn't work so this does give us one this gives us well 2 * 0 is 0 + 1 is 1 so we're going to start with x - 4 if I plug in zero here I get one factorial which is just one you guys okay with that so far y next term is it going to be positive or negative plus or minus this is an alternating series because that thing is alternating so we're going to get minus I'm still going to get notice notice what happens here and what doesn't happen here actually are there any ends in here at all so is this thing ever going to change no no it's not changing so you're going to be writing things like X or x - four over and over and over again the thing that changes is the power it's a power series the power is changing of our variable and this denominator so I still have x -4 but my power is going to change and what and my denominator is going to change what's my power going to be remember that I plugged in zero first I'm going to plug in one now what is it so this is 2 the3 over and notice how this is the same as this so if this is three this is three factorial this is five this is 5 factorial 3 factorial plus we have x - < / 4 to the 5th over 5 factorial what it's giving us is odd numbers the next one would be 7 over 7 factorial 9 over 9 factorial does that make sense to you that's our power series centered at Pi 4 now we're going to talk about the the theory kind of some some notes behind this first thing do you notice that when I'm doing this when we're doing this we're actually getting a function out of it do you see that M we get a function based on X so a function of X these power series are all going to create functions of x so if these things create a function of X then what we can do all the time with our power series do you understand that what I'm talking about a function of X yes no if I actually do the series there's no more ends the end does 0 1 2 3 4 5 to Infinity what I get is a a series of terms all of which have variables in them and that variable is always X does that make sense it's a function of X so what that means is that I can define a function of x to be equal to my power series um by the way I'm wondering if you understand why I'm using this form of our power series rather than this one do you understand that this form is like the general form of this if I have C equals 0 then it gives me this one so therefore I can always use this and be correct as far as my general power series quick head now if you're okay with that one okay so does that make sense to you if this thing is a function of X we already said it was because what happens is I'm going to get a subn is going to be a number a constant number for every individual term and when I put zero or one or two or three or four or five or whatever into my n that's going to be a constant this of course is going to be a variable that's going to be a con constant so I'm going to get a function in terms of whatever my variable here is it's going to be a function in terms of X now this is what's going to be interesting please listen carefully if I have a function equal to my series oops when I plug in some X when I plug in some X I'm going to get a series of terms correct that series is either going to converge or it's not not going to converge does that make sense to you so I'm going to have a series I'll have x's in it you say hey give me an X whatever you give me I'm going to plug in my X either the series will converge or the series will not converge does that make sense if the series converges we would get a sum out of it does that make sense if the series does not converge of course we wouldn't be able to find the sum so if the series converges we get a sum that sum is the output of my function the input of my function is of course my X but I only will get a valid output if my input makes my series convergent I'm going go through that one more time because this is kind of the theoretical wait a minute does that make sense to me let me say it again okay here's what's happening when I plug a number in it's going to create a series so plug a number in for X not N N's already zero to Infinity I'm plugging a number in for x here and here and here and here and whatever I'm going to get a series that either converges or diverges does that make sense to you if it converges I get a sum that sum is the output of my function if it does not converge diverges then I don't have a valid sum okay it'd be like infinity or it would be undefined we can't do that so what we're saying here is this function is defined with a domain remember that domains all the things we plug in with a domain of all X's such that the series converges this is a function with a domain of all X's such that the series converges if the series does not converge then I don't have an output for my function does that make sense do you need me to explain that one I tried to explain it three different ways but I they all end up sounding kind of the same because it's the same idea all three all three different ways it's the same thing are there any questions on this idea I know we haven't done any examples but I want to make sure this is clear before we go absolutely any further to make sure that you get it do you get it that uh this thing can be defined as a function of X because X is our variables do you understand that series either converge or diverge okay do you understand that for certain values of x X this series will converge and for certain values of X this series will diverge some of the times so sometimes you plug in anything it's going to converge sometimes you plug in anything it's going to diverge but a lot of the times we have some x's that's going to make the series converge and some x's that's going to make the series diverge do you get that do you understand that if the series diverges I can't really represent this very well with the function because I'm not going to have a sum the sum is my output I sound sound very s my output uh some is my out therefore when you put in an X that gives me then I when y'all put in an X I say when I was 13 my parents took me on a trip around the United States and we spent a long time in the South and so I actually did pick up an accent from down there in Louisiana and Texas and all those places so by the time I got to Boston I sounded all messed up you know that age you're picking up a lot of L so anyway anyhow so if this thing is a function of X and I plug in certain numbers of X some will make it convergent some will make the series Divergent those values of X which make this series convergent mean that I get a sum for those values of x if a series a conversion I get a sum so for the values of X which make this thing convergent I get an output of my function therefore we have a function with a domain of of all X's that make my series convergent the X's that make the series Divergent we don't care about because we can't define the function there show hands if that made sense okay you understand a power series then that is what a power series is now let me give you a couple examples on how we actually do this and what we can do with it not not any hardcore examples yet we're still kind of on the the note taking part of this so we got the power series idea power series idea does make a function so that our domain is all the X's that make the series converge that's it now let's look at what we can do with it let's start with the most basic power series I can think of it's just this the series of n = 1 to Infinity sorry from one 0 to Infinity of x to n firstly is it a power series yes okay uh what's my as subn one one it's one yeah that's a very simple power series but still a power series let's look at some of you guys zone out don't zone out on me here uh let's look at the first few terms just to get an idea about what this is what's the first term here next term next term good and then it continues continues continues forever never never here's what's kind of interesting these power series are going to represent series a lot of the times that you've seen before or that you can work with in the same manner you work with the other series for instance this right here might look weird to you this is a geometric series that's all it is it's just a geometric series and I'll show you why this is simply a geometric series do you see it yet no no let me let me put this on the board do you understand that a geometric series is a * R to the N yes that's a geometric series uh well if that's a geometric series by the way um sorry when does this thing con do you remember when it converges R it's all based on the r when R is absolute I see the value greater or equal p series greater than one make sure it's on your note card note card note card it right now yeah by the way um that R I don't know if I ever told you this that R is called the common ratio did I ever tell you that no it's called the common ratio like 20 sections later whatever so um a geometric series converges when the common ratio R is in absolute terms of absolute value is less than one that's what this this thing is now I want you to consider this for a second so the series X to the N has a common ratio of x oh look up here does this fit this format yes what's our a no the a is one a would equal one what's taking the place of our what's taking the place of our R the X that's why I said has a common ratio of X that is the r in this case so so what's really interesting is that this thing is really a geometric series now the question is when do geometric series converge when R when the r is less okay so so I I don't want to lose you here do you understand the idea I'm trying to make this look like geometric series it is geometric series it's just the a is one the r is x in this case that's geometric now if geometric series converge when the absolute value of R is less than one then this series converges when the absolute value of x is not zero less than one less than one less than one that's the idea of the common ratio the common ratio well okay it says converges if the common ratio is less than one this has a common ratio of X it will converge if x is less than one in terms of absolute value or if you want to think about it this way when -1 is less than x Which is less than one so is this diver it's convergent let's talk about it one more time just to make sure that you are with me on this thing first things first are you starting to see that this is geometric it is this it just happens that R is no longer a constant it happens to be a variable now what we know about geometric series is that geometric series converge every time this number is between1 and one therefore I don't give a heck what that's not even it's a thing now I don't give a crap what uh give a what this is in India what this is as long as this number is between negative 1 and one non-inclusive does that make sense to you that's what this says I don't care what this number is as long it's between 1 and one non-inclusive this will converge this would if I give you negative 1/2 is that going to converge how about uh 1/3 1/4 1/5th 1 16 and then forever until you get to zero how about zero how about 1/2 how about 1/3 how about 1/4 all the way to yeah it's going to converge for everything as long as this is between as long as this is between because this is that it is a geometric series does that make sense to you you sure so our domain is right here remember that the whole thing hey this thing that defines a function of X doesn't it are are you are you catching this picture this defines a function of X when will this function of X conge it will converge when X is between 1 and 1 that's what we're saying here this is a function on a very specific domain is it a function defined everywhere folks everywhere no it's defined for a very specific set of x's what's the set of x's that this is defined to be that's our domain that's it now here's what's also very cool do you know how to find the sum of geometric series a r so in our case here the sum is a over 1 - r a over 1 - R check this out so if F ofx and this is this is kind of how we'd write it mathematically okay we said a lot of I said a lot of words here you didn't say very much forget you guys but I said a lot of words all right here's what this says this says I have a function this is a function of X this function X is geometric if it's geometric it will have a sum the sum is defined to be a um how much is our a one over 1 - R what is our R aha the common ratio is r or in this case X put it all together folks do you understand that's a function of X do you understand that's geometric it will have a sum M do you understand that this sum is only valid when this thing converges do you get that and when does this thing conge yeah this is awesome this is really cool because uh CU here's what this says do you do you guys this is this is equal right and this is equal right because this a series is a sum and this is the sum of any geometric series when X is between Nea 1 and one because that's when this series converges that's therefore when we can find the sum what that means is that this series actually represents the function FX = 1 1 - x that's what it represents but only on a c interval only between what two numbers you got it I'm using interval notation here 1 to one the interval 1 to one um so if you want what in the world are you freaking talking about L here's a deal uh give me a number between1 and one a half like a half so if you wanted to you could plug a half in here right and find out what it is if you wanted to you could plug one2 in here and here and here and here forever and add it all up it's going to equal exactly what you get out right here cool it's kind of weird right so we're using these series to represent functions or rather we're using functions to represent series same idea soens if you understand the idea power series represent functions that's what they do because they have x's in them functions of X they represent these functions only on certain intervals for which the series converge if you get that idea you do understand power series do you understand power series my speech is al off power series said parachute parachute you understand parachutes jump out of planes if they open you live how it works usually okay uh show hands if you honestly do you feel okay with that one are there any other questions whatsoever on that so so our X is our input our sum is our output that's how it works couple other little notes for you before we get on to I do want to kind of go quickly through this because I want to do an example to give you the idea of what you're going to be doing here question oh that's just a proof right what you to show this or take we find out if that thing actually converges it AES or not well that's the whole point is that your X is a variable correct yeah so I can't tell you this converges all the time unless it converges for all X's what you're doing is you're saying okay if this is this and this is a geometric series then I know when it will converge what you're basically doing is giving me the interval for which this will converge that's what you're doing not the other way around you're telling me that it will converge or won't converge it will at some point give me the interval that it does converge at does that make sense then the interval that it does converge at is is the domain of your function otherwise there would be no sum you could not Define your function that way do you guys get the idea you're you're saying will this converge let's find out if it does what's the interval that it will converge at what X's can I plug in that's my domain because you're defining your domain to be the ver the the values where your series converges therefore you get an output for your function if you don't get an output for your function how you can define a function well I talked a lot did that make sense too I said the same thing earlier but I want to make sure you really got it now let's talk about for general power Series so when we have a function equal to a general power Series where it's doesn't necessarily Center at zero by the way if you where is this thing centered do you understand that if I plug in C all I get is a sub Z does that make sense to you but I plug in C everything else besides the first term is gone because you have x - c if x is C if x is C then x- C would be 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 all I to have is a0 first that's defined as your Center okay so the reason why we have why we say it's centered at the origin please listen carefully is if I plug in um like to let's see well if I plug in my Center itself would I end up getting it is something right around the origin all right if I plug in the center here I'm going to get a sub 0 it's going to be centered at C comma a Sub 0 that's going to be the first point of my function now what else I want to say oh yeah the domain this is kind of important for you too the domain of your power series is always going to be some interval that is centered around C notice something what's the center here the center it's got to be a constant the center is zero the origin zero look at your domain what's right in the middle of your domain it's centered at zero that's where we get the word center from that's what Center means okay it's right the center of your interval so uh note for you the domain of f ofx the domain of your function your power series will always be an interval with xal C at the center of it hence why we call C the center now we have a few conditions for convergence of a power series I want to tell you about before we get to our example I really hope we get to our example today I'm not sure if we will but at least we'll get through this so convergence of a power series could be one of three things first thing you might have a power Series where the function is only defined at the center it could be defined just at xal C if it's defined at xal C only we would say that the radius of convergence is zero a radius has this idea of you going around something doesn't it the radius of convergence is zero it's only at one point let me make sure you understand this here real quick look at the board this has a center of zero it converges at zero it has a radius of convergence of one because it goes to 1 and one that's where Circle it kind of yeah so it's not going really up or down but it's centered at zero it has a radius of one so we go 1 and one does that make sense to you so we can have power series functions which are defined just at the center and you have no radius of convergence Therefore your R I'm going to Define r in just a bit R would be zero and the interval would be this it's a silly interval but it would be 0 is less than or equal to x - c Which is less than or equal to Z it would be the interval of converion would just be right at the center does that make sense you sure okay number B you could have an interval of convergence that incorporates or includes all xes so are there times when a power series is always convergent yes for any X yes if I had a power series with which converges for any X for anything what's the interval of what's the radius of convergence I would say infinity it says hey you know what I converges for any number therefore the radius goes positive infity negative infinity and therefore we would get an interval of convergence from negative Infinity to Infinity centered at C whever that is you guys okay with that one yeah this this one's not all that interesting just converges all the time okay this one's not all that interesting because it has no radius of convergence it converges at the center cool C's where we like I like it's these are the more interesting ones to me I like to spend most of my time here we can have convergence for values that are within a certain radius where and this is mathematically how you say this where if you're outside of that radius you get Divergence so let me uh let me make a couple notes on this one because I haven't defined this yet first thing that R is called your radius of convergence what it means is how far can you go above and below your Center remember the center is always the center of your interval of convergence okay it's always a center so says how far can you go above and below that Center of convergence and we still have a power series that works for you still has a a defined power series that's what the radius convergence is above and below now we can do this with this since since absolute value of x - c is less than R what that means is that R is less than x - c Which is less than R which means if I solve for C what we get is C minus r R and C + r that right there is your interval of convergence that tells you how far down and how far up you can go keep in mind whatever these two numbers are c will be in the middle of those because you're adding C to both sides C's going to be in the middle of these right here C's going to be right in the middle so C's going to be in the middle of this whatever your your constant is uh you can also write it this way C - R to C + r now last little comment before I I give you a uh an example on this one I want to get through at least one do you notice anything about this I said less than and I said greater than where's the equal to go greater the equal to would be the end points of your interval do you get that now I'm not say anything about the end points the end points must be checked individually so the op the way we go through these is we find first the interval of convergence we find this of course we find the radius of convergence before that that's going to lead us to our interval of convergence after that you must check whether each end point is included or not does that make sense and to do that um we use conversion tests because we've already done that so we plug in a value for x look at this listen I'm trying to give you everything without an example I know but if you had this one I said okay we have a we have a power series now plug in a value of x what that value of x does it gives you a legit series doesn't it not a power series anymore but an actual series which we can check with a convergence test so to discover whether end points are included you use a conver convergence test you might want to write that down so for end points use a conversion test for end points use a conversion test would you like to see an example I'd like to give you one before we we head out just so this is not all abstract for you yes no that CLS fast remember go for the gold Mr Leonard go for the gold that's what the really for life is okay so here we go uh you find convergence first this is going to give you the interval of convergence or Divergence or oh sorry um for Interval convergence and then you use your end points and use whatever you can to find out whether those end points are concluded included with a with a different conversion test let me give you this one so firstly what type of series power power series of course what's in there that uh would probably help us on what to do first what do you see up there factorial tells you to do something up here now listen what we're going to do is we're going to do the same test that we've just done in our last section because we still need to find out the interval of convergence we need to find out when this thing converges so what are we going to do with this problem ra we're going do the ratio test now keep in mind when we do the ratio test the ratio test says convergence absolute convergence actually when when the the limit of a ratio is less than what number shows Divergence when it's greater than one it's inconclusive when it equals to one does that make sense to you we're going to use that here so I'll I'll be upright and straightforward with you you're going to be doing the ratio test an awful lot for this stuff and the reason why is because the ratio test has a number associated with it it says that it converges when something happens does that make sense that when something happens that's going to give you your inter that you want so let's go as far as we can in the next couple minutes and see if we can do it so because we get that factorial we're going to do the ratio test listen I'm going to go quickly through the ratio test because I want to get to the punchline of this problem so ratio test ratio test would do this ratio test would put uh which a sub over so we'd have n + 1 uhhuh over what factorial very good that's exactly right so let's do it can you simplify this stuff firstly tell me something about the absolute value do you need it or do you not need it no no better better watch yourself there what's X we don't know ah is it always positive don't then you better keep it you better not just arbitrarily get rid of this thing does that make sense so be careful don't just jump to don't create your own map don't don't don't jump to conclusions here that would be bad now can we simplify this what simplifies Lots yeah lots we can do the X where's the X going to be X will be here this is x n * x x is on the numerator this do you remember do we we've done this several times you're going to get it several times more if this is n factorial this is n factorial time n + 1 so when I simplify that I get at n + 1 so what we get is a limit n approaches Infinity n Plus + 1 in parentheses * X are you okay with that one yeah strip off everything besides your X's outside of the absolute value here's why you can do it is n + one always positive yeah that's what we're going to do that's what you guys probably meant when you said absolute value you're thinking of just the ends so when we go okay well that's always positive I can do n + one outside of my absolute value and now we're going to talk about this for a second we're going to talk about when this will converge and when this will diverge so real fast I'm going to write this twice you know actually um would you remember if we got if I give this to you tomorrow uh where start cuz I want to stop right now I don't want to keep it any longer so we're working on our very first Power series and trying to show when this thing is convergent now the idea is use some sort of a test typically it's going to be the ratio test to find out where this series is converging you see the idea was and I'm not going to repeat the whole thing but the idea is this power series represents some sort of function but only where it converges so we're going to find out where this converges what our domain is basically the domain is the interval of convergence because therefore we can Define our function as the series on some domain where X makes the series converge that was all practically our last time's lesson you guys you all right with that so far so what we've done is said hey you know what that's got factorials let's use ratio test so we're going to work this down reason why we like the ratio test is because it Compares it to some number it says this thing is going to converge when the limit is less than what number let's try this again the ratio test says that this series will converge when the limit is less than what number now here's the deal please listen carefully because this is where it's coming from n's approaching Infinity right yeah so let me put in any number for X what is any what's infinity plus one by the way so this is going to be Infinity if I put in any number for x take an absolute value of it and multiply it by Infinity what's it going to be unless that number is zero I don't care if it's negative because if I take absolute value of a negative it's going to make it positive right so plug in negative a billion well then you're going to get positive a billion uh hello it's going to still be Infinity what's the one number that you can multiply by and get zero now if you're thinking well wait a minute isn't that an indeterminate form Infinity time0 not really because this is X it's not an N it's not in terms of what this is so this is legitimately zero all the time zero all the time zero does that make sense that's different so we have two situations we have a situation where if x is any number beside zero if x is any number beside zero I take an absolute value of it it's positive it's some number I multiply by infinity and what I'm going to get is infinity If X is not zero does that make sense to you yeah are you sure yes okay now if x is zero I don't care what this is how much is this going to be Z if x does equal zero now here's where the type of test we use comes into play and why it's so important are you listening yeah the ratio test says that we're going to get convergence or Divergence based on what number we get so when we get infinity all you've got to do is compare these things to one so is infinity more than one or less than one of course it's more than one so by the ratio test because Infinity is greater than one by ratio test we get uh what is it when it's greater than one we get diverence now what about this one when X does equal Z when X does equal Z we get our limit equals to zero well how's that compare to one greater than less than so by the ratio test abely we get what absolutely conver that's right absolutely convergent I don't really care so much about the absolute part but we do have convergence you see we said nothing about uh the function has to it's it's the domain is where the uh X values make it absolutely convergent it's just convergent so where it does say absolute convergence you're absolutely right because ratio test gives us absolute convergence we care more about the convergence itself does that make sense to you so by the ratio test this thing is absolutely convergent therefore it must be convergent so feel okay with that so far now here's what this says to you and we're going to do a few more examples to illustrate each type of case that you can have okay so here's what we've done we said how are we going to how in the world are we going to find the the domain for this we already know a couple things we already know a power series represents a function what we don't know is where the where is the domain that's what you're trying to find so you go okay what we find out with this is where this function is defined so where our function which represents this power series is defined all right well cool use a ratio test because the ratio test will tell you where so we work this down we got ratio test no problem pretty easy we got absolute value but n's always positive so absolute value is gone here we absolute X this is not gone because X can be negative X is any number all right well there's two situations we have if x does not equal zero doesn't equal Zer that's a number a number times infinity gives you infinity because Infinity is greater than one we say hey you know what by the ratio test that's diverent here's what that means if I plug in any listen listen carefully because this is a big deal okay if I plug in any number beside zero do I have convergence or Divergence therefore our function is not defined for any number that is not zero does that make sense to you so you go all right if I plug in X does not equal Z half a third negative 1 I don't care what it is this thing is going to diverge now the the other thing says okay what if x does equal 0 if x does equal 0 then our limit equals 0 by the ratio test that's less than one so by the ratio test that is convergent therefore for our series convergence and since our domain for our power series the function of our power series is all X's that make our series convergent we only have one value that does that what's the one value of x that makes this thing convergent that's the idea so this is one of those cases remember I gave you three cases of what you can have with your power series I gave it to you last time U what I said was that your power series could be at the Center only only at zero that's this case there is no radius of convergence the radius is zero it does there's no there's no space there it says there's only one number you can plug in to make this series conversion and one number you plug in is zero that's it there's no radius of convergence there's no interval of convergence it just happens to be zero you sure you're okay with that and it happens to be at the center itself so we get out of this we go Okay cool so by the ratio test our domain is simply xals 0 it says so right here also little side note the ratio the um sorry the uh the radius of convergence is what's the radius of convergence zero it's only one number radius of convergence is zero would you like another example that's a little bit different from this this one has only one number that you're good at it's only at zero there's no other number that works therefore our radius of convergence is zero it's nothing doesn't go above zero or below Zer it's exactly at zero show F if that made sense okay let's continue I want to do as many examples I can to give you every type of uh scenario here okay true or false this thing is a power series true or false absolutely what tells you it's a power series it's right there right there that's a power series not a problem now talking about our power series does it represent a function or can we represent this by as a function this is a function in terms of X for sure it's a function in terms of X now do we know the domain for such a function no but going to find it that's the whole idea so what we know is that this thing is a function of X when I write it out it's a function of X but it's only a function of X where it converges the where it converges is our domain so we're going to find out where this thing converges well let's let's try it um how do we do that a ratio test R let's do the ratio test ratio test is great for us for a number of reasons firstly it gives convergence and it gives Divergence right so it tells you where your series is convergent and where it's Divergent what that means is you can find your domain from that that's why we use the ratio test so much that's why I say it's so powerful so let's set up the ratio test I want you to set up the ratio test right now see if you can do it so you're going to write out what you're doing okay write out ratio test don't forget your absolute values because ratio test always has absolute values don't forget that one of these goes on top a subn plus one or a subn what goes on top okay I want to stop you right there I want to make sure that you got this let's see I I'll have you do the rest of it kind of on your own but I want to make sure you got at least this part right did you get -1 to the n + 1 here did you get x to the 2 n + 1 or the 2 n + 2 yeah you got you got n plus one in parentheses or you did 2 N plus 2 you distributed correct you didn't get 2 N plus one did you no okay good and you got the same thing here 2 * n + 1 of course we're going to distribute that no problem probably could and then factorial how many people got that one now the main denominator is pretty easy it's just this thing again that's quite a problem isn't it what's the next thing that you would do what would you do if you had this problem in the test which you're going to get something real similar to this what would you do the thetive ones very good yeah the absolute value is nice for ratio test because the negative 1es are gone so this gone this don't care what it is it's gone he gone CU negative 1 to ABS well absolute value of negative 1 no matter what it is or one it's going to give you one anyway so these things those are gone so in terms of absolute value that does not matter what else would you do here please good I'd multiply by the reciprocal changing division multiplication very good let's do that step if you haven't done already go ahead and do it now also what I'm going to do at this point you can do this too I'm going to do my distribution if you haven't done already this be a good spot to do it so here I'm going to give my X 2N + 2 over my 2 n + 2 factorial * 2N factorial over x 2 N true or false I can drop my absolute value from here to here true or false don't know FSE you don't know what oh it's squ never mind squ they are they're both squared so you can you could actually do it does it matter no not really I'm going to put them just just to get us in the habit okay so that we don't automatically drop them I'm going to put them but yeah you could if you see this you could factor out that square do you see it you could do it you just fine I want to put them just in case so if you can make it that far you feel okay with it now what would you do simpli simplif simplify as much as you can now uh when we simplify this thing this is something you're going to have to be pretty good at being able to simplify x 2 n x 2 N plus 2 you got to know what that plus two actually means here okay you got to be good at simplifying 2 N factorial and 2 n + 2 factorial you got to know what this means so I'm going to go through it one time with you from here on not I'm probably just going to kind of simplify on my own because I'm going to expect that you understand this uh let's consider this first this is the easier of the two I'm going to write up here and I'm going to erase it so if you're going to write it down write it down quickly X 2N + 2 I can even write it down jeez x 2 n + 2 over X 2N if you know what this is this is X 2N * x^2 x 2 N you multiply common bases you add powers therefore I can split up any addition of powers by multiplication comma bases that therefore gives you X2 feel okay with that one so when I do this I'm going to go okay well boom boom X2 so far so good now this one's a little more tricky to think of it's not hard it's a little more tricky to think of 2 N factorial over 2 n + 2 fact faial but think about what 2 n + 2 factorial would be do you understand that when you're doing factorials you take the first term and then you multiply by the term right below it so basically you multiply by the number one less than it so if I had five factorial it's 5 * 5 - 1 * 5 - 2 * 5 - 3 so this would be 2 n + 2 that would be the first term does that make sense yeah then I would have 2 n + aha does that make sense then I would have 2 N and then I would have oh but wait a second this is 2N factorial all the rest of that stuff is 2N factorial so fans you understand that concept we've used it before but now we've never had a plus two so let me assure you you can do this with a plus anything it just is 2 n + 2 * 2 n + 1 * 2 n * 2 N - 1 * 2 but that's that's this that's exactly what this is so basically this gives you 1 over 2 n + 2 * what times what 2 and that's it are you with me on that one that one's kind of tricky for people I want to make sure that you're okay with that yeah are you sure so when you simplify something like this you okay what's what's here what's here well this is this is 2 N Factor this thing right here is 2 N factorial with a little extra with two extra terms the 2 n+ 1 and the 2 N plus 2 and that's it for sure you okay with that one BR up say what now you just split it up you split it up you go well what is what is this thing really it's really 2 n + 2 * 2 n + 1 * 2N oh but this the rest of this is 2 N factorial so I can cross out all of this with this and then I get 1 over 2 n + 2 * 2 + 1 and that's what we're going to do here now I got to move back over [Music] here so let's see what we have left over can you tell me CU I'm going to get lost over there so what what do we got X2 over uhhuh abute okay absolute value sure do I need the absolute value anymore for sure I don't that's an X squ there's no way it's going to be negative uh this is both positive there's no way that's going to be negative so I can drop my absolute value right now if you want to now here's the deal here's a deal at this point at this point we're going to see what happens when we let our n Go to Infinity we've already simplified everything we can right if we go let our n let our n Go to Infinity what are we going to get now remember something about this you're going to give me a number for X right yeah so pick any number I don't care what it is but it's a finite number does that make sense it's anything take any number and square it do you understand that's still a finite number now divide it by what this is going to what's this whole thing going to infity Infinity so what's this divided by this for no matter what x is right oh yeah equals zero do you understand why it's four no matter what x is cu X is not changing as n is changing n is going to Infinity X is not X is not b based on n x is X is this x say uh pick a number but it's it's a it's one number it's not going to be a variety of numbers it is called a variable I understand that but you pick one number you say x is now let's see about 3/4 okay X is now 1 million okay X is now5 okay but no matter what it is you're going to stick with that number you got it then you square it you stick with that number then you divide it by something that's growing to Infinity if you div divide it by something that's growing to Infinity you have a finite number over infinity and that idea is zero and this works for all X here's my question if this works for all x what that says is that are you with me yes say I don't care what you plug in for X this this series will converge does that make sense to you yeah now how do I know that this thing's going to converge how do I know that what test did we use and what answer did we get with our ratio test and that is less than one perfect so we say this is less than one so therefore it converges by the ratio test and what we've made our determination is that this is for all X now if you have something that converges for all x what that means is that I don't care what you plug into right here this this power series will converge for anything we've just proved it does that make sense to you cu no matter what you plug in hey guess what it's going to be zero cool well that means that we converge for all X if we converge for all X our radius of convergence says infinity infinity so the radius R would be infinity and our interval of convergence would be well this is hopefully pretty common sense says if you can plug in anything right your radius is infinite if you can plug in anything our domain is negative Infinity to Infinity remember that the domain is all X's that make our series converge if we can plug in anything to make our power series converge then our domain is infinite negative Infinity to Infinity so if fans feel okay with that okay we've covered two out of three three scenarios we've covered one where we just converge at one number just at the center and that's it the radius would be zero we've covered the next one where we converge at any number I don't care what it is our radius would be infinite and we'd have netive Infinity to Infinity let's talk about the third example question um if you can plug in Infinity into X but you can't okay so it's everything except for actual well X you're Define X to be any number right but you can't say infinity for X because that's not a number we say plug in anything negative infity to Infinity of course you can't get to here that's why we use our parenthesis that's why in our interval notation you don't use a bracket because the idea of going to Infinity is a limit right kind of accomplish that X does not get to go to Infinity in this case n is going to Infinity in this this case does that make sense okay that's a good question any other questions before we do our our next example we're going to do several more but I want to make sure you're good and N is different or Infinity is different for n because the idea of our limit here is saying that our n is growing our terms are going to Infinity our X doesn't change though right so once you start this you pick X you stick with it so it's first term then first terms times an X then second term * an x to the second third term * x to the third fourth term * x to the 5th but the X doesn't change the x is one number so if we say I don't care what number you pick stick with it the series is going to converge that's what's going to happen here no matter what x is no matter what x is that power series converges therefore this represents our function for all X you still are you sure you're with me you to do one more yeah so the first example we had today the one we we just ended that represented a function represents that for only one value of x that value of x would be zero a function represents this power series for any value of x all the time it's going to converge for anything let's look at our third and final example third and final scenario iose a seemingly harmless example these are these are a little more fun though these are the ones that I like okay the first one well it's it's always going to equal well the only time it equals z is if x is zero okay this one equals zero all the time it's less than one all the time for any value of x that that's kind of boring let's look at this one look at what happens here so uh first thing what type of series is that uh Power series that's right it's a power Series so okay if it's a power series uh well we need to find out where the series is going to be convergent in the first example it was only at zero in the second example it was anywhere in this example we got to discover where this thing is convergent because only where our series converges is where we can define a function for it only on the domain so first example domain was x equals 0 second example domain is infinity infinity to Infinity third example we're going to discover where that is it's going Tak us a little bit of time on this one so what would you do first root test you could maybe do the root test if you wanted to I'm going to encourage you to stick with the ratio test uh this is going to be a little hard to do the root test because you don't have a power of n there so it'll be a little little difficult so i' probably stick with the ratio test still ratio test works for powers of n as well so try out the ratio test go ahead and set up the ratio test if you would question you don't want to use the limit test we don't know what x is no the ratio test right there will give you where this converges and diverges which is so why it's so nice right because it says well it tells you whether converges or diverges therefore it will give you the interval here of convergence and Divergence so we can't do really a like the Divergence test you wouldn't use that here you use a ratio test to tell you where it's going to be convergent and where it's going to be Divergent okay now after after we do that I'll show you when you can use something like a diverence test okay so we're going to use the ratio test and I'm hoping you're already working on it ratio test says that hey do we need absolute value for a ratio test yeah because that n's changing this is going to be possibly if you give me a Negative X positive and negative you need the absolute value on the numerator you need to have x n + 1 over n+ 1 that's right and the denominator you need to have x to the N over that's it n your absolute value this one's going to be kind of nice we have a limit we have n approaches Infinity are we still going to have our absolute values yes absolutely yeah that's right and we got x n + 1 over n + 1 times n x did I get that right yes okay what would you do now simplify as much as you can also also collect your n terms and collect your X term you'll simplify the X terms okay okay there's going to be only one X left collect your end terms pull those outside of your absolute value because they're always positive anyway does that make sense to you so what I mean by this is well simplify what you can but don't do stupid things don't go oh well n and n cross out I'm done don't do that don't do that simplify this sure x to the n x to the n + 1 gives you one extra X that's what the plus one is it's x to the first Power this you don't simplify right now this you're going to do a limit with in just a minute what I mean is collect this collect it and say okay well that means that we got a limit as n approaches Infinity of n/ n + 1 * X in absolute value are you still okay with that yeah you sure yeah now is n / n +1 always positive yes because n's growing from 1 to Infinity yes it is is X always positive we can't make that jump I don't know what x is so what I can do this is what I've been telling you collect your n terms pull your n terms out of your absolute value if they're all positive they generally will be so we're going to have n/ n + 1 time the absolute value of x now this is why I like these it's a lot more interesting you got to do a little bit more work with it is it super hard no it's not super hard but you get to do a little more work with it so please pay attention this is how you do the rest the first two are kind of our basic ones okay X is zero only for zero no radius X is infinity radius INF X is I'm sorry X is zero for all X therefore radius is infinity no problem this is more interesting take the limit as n approaches Infinity of n/ n Plus one what you get how much you get do low I don't care what you do divide by largest power of n whatever you're going to get one this whole thing is one does that make sense to you what is X as n approaches Infinity it's absolute value of x it's whatever you have here so what we end up getting listen please we get 1 * the absolute value of x we get the absolute value of x okay I need to show up hands if that makes sense to you notice that the the X doesn't change it's the N that's going to Infinity therefore we have this idea of a limit of n like we normally have we just have tacked on this absolute value of x now here's the deal this is why we use the ratio test you see the ratio test tells you when you're going to be convergent this is the whole deal so if you get this you're going to get the whole thing okay the ratio test tells you when you're be convergent when does the ratio test tell you that your power series is going to be convergent when the limit is less than what when what's less than one absolute value this not X the absolute value of x so did did you guys catch that we're using the ratio test right yeah ratio test says hey go through all this crap and at the very end if this thing is less than one then you will have a convergent series or you'll have a convergent power Series in this this case the reason why this is here why the less than one is here is because we just use the ratio test show fans if that made sense to you that's why we're doing it folks now this is kind of cool that's just very cool give me a specific value of x that you could plug in that you you know that this series is going to converge forward give me a specific value2 would be great zero would be fantastic what else ne one2 how about two no that's bigger than one how about one itself how about negative one itself no yes I don't know I don't know the ratio test does not tell you so here's what we know so far did you guys catch the whole idea about if you have a value between 1 and one between not inclusive but in between you will for sure have a convergent power series then here's what we know already because of this case because absolute value X has to be less than one by the ratio test we know that -1 is less than x Which is less than one we know X basically has to be between 1 and 1 now let me tell you something right here is where you find your radius of convergence it's really easy to do please listen carefully what you need to find your radius of convergence is what whatever is being raised to the nth power x in this case if it was x -1 to the N you'd look for x - one that's look really nasty I know but if you had x -1 in there you look for x -1 here and whatever that number is that is what your radius of convergence is so in our case our radius of convergence is what number is this what's a radius of convergence there you go so you look for whatever's being raised to this power right here when you get that that is your radius of convergence so the radius of convergence is one so so far what we know is that yeah our power series represents a function no problem we've used our ratio test to say that this thing this power series is going to converge when the absolute value of x is less than for sure so basically when X is between1 and 1 what that says is the radius by the way um what's the center what's the center of this zero origin zero the or okay zero Hey add one to zero what do you get subtract one from zero what do you get that's why the center is zero the radius is one okay if you and the way you do this is you find out the thing that's being raised to n that's your radius that's what it is now the issue is are the end points included or not well the ratio test does not tell you that you have to determine that so now for our end points it's not hard in fact it's all that stuff that you learn about series which is kind of cool so now for end points um can you tell me what are our two end points that we have here and one got to check both of them there's only two things you got to check two two things you got to check there's only two end points so we're going to check 1 and we're going to check one go wait a minute how in the world can I check my end points well let plug it in I just spit all over do you see that gross plug it in here so here we go so if we have our series n equals I say one should that one is one interesting so if we have our our Series going from one to Infinity of x to the N Over N uh what am I plugging in for am I plugging in for the N or am I plugging in for the X X it says X so what we get is a series from one to Infinity of oh it can't be zero we divide oh I'm sorry what what's our X going to be wait a minute look at that okay so if we plug in negative one what's it do it changes our power series into just the typical series that you have seen before this will change into something you've seen before tell me about that one Al alternating harmonic we've done alternating harmonic before it converges so this is an alternating harmonic series and because we've done this already before we know this thing converges if you listen carefully if you didn't know it converges you would do one of the tests you've already done you would do alternating you wouldn't do absolute convergence here because if you do absolute convergence you get one over n and that would be Divergent but remember that when you're doing absolute listen carefully to this one okay when you're doing absolute conver if you take the absolute value and the series you get diverges it doesn't mean the whole original series diverges it means that it just doesn't absolutely converge remember that idea about conditionally converging was the first thing that we talked about okay so here you go well let's do the alternating series test the limit is zero it's clearly decreasing alternating series test says converges so even if you didn't remember this we get it convergence now the next one I'm going to move it up here didn't take a lot of work the next one if we get a series Nal 1 to Infinity of X the N / n and we say let's let our xal 1 then we get the series from n = 1 to Infinity of 1 to the N Over N what's thaton 1 to the N is always one isn't it what's that again tell me some about harmonic so we only [Music] includ that my friends is how you find out whether or not your end points are included so here's what you do for the most part on all these problems with your power series it's not that hard I know it looked originally like oh my gosh what are we doing here it's not that hard honestly what we what you're doing you're taking power series you're going okay I know that represents a function where use a ratio test the ratio test will tell you where remember ratio test only converges for whatever you get here is less than one so ratio test is cool man you know where that's going to converge you just don't know the end points use those end points in your original Power series with some of those tests you already know alternate hon converges harmonic diverges what end point will we include what end point will we not include one we include good and one we don't include one okay so now the last thing we're going to do here so last thing we're going to do so our radius what was our radius of convergence and our interval of convergence is what's our interval of convergence bracket why is there a bracket there1 makes that series converg remember our domain is all the numbers that make our series converge so if it converges negative 1's included if one diverges one is not included we already had the rest of it right here so we go negative 1 to one and just talking about the end points now does that make sense by the way what was the center for this zero where's the center between this does it make sense tell you what let's go ahead and start one more this is practically we have two more examples and that's about it then I'll teach you how to do calculus of power series how to do derivatives and integrals of this stuff yes you can yes you can you can do it don't fret don't fuss it's calculus do it so dorky I can't help it oops that can't be right there we go oh dear all right let's do it let's go through it right now uh firstly what what is this you see something like that with X ra to n that's power series absolutely power series for sure now you tell me right now where is this power series centered at two very good centered at two which means this when we get down to this part our interval of convergence the center is going to be at two it'll be two if it if it converges it's going to be at two if it converges a more than one number it'll be two plus and minus the radius of whether that's infinity or that's a finite number does that make sense to you but two will be at the center for sure okie dokie what are you going to do ratio test do ratio test that's not power ratio test is going to give us something less than one anyway do a ratio test what are you going to use for most of these things ratio do you understand the ratio test works when the root test works as well yes do the ratio test so we're going to State what we're using and then we use it be real careful on getting these correct here be real careful of course the a sub n is pretty easy because it gives it to you but don't make a mistake on the the n+ one idea uh remember the a subn always goes on our main denominator here so we're going to have x - 2 n/ n² * 3 n you forget one little thing and this problem explodes in your face okay we're going to get that in a second okay so up here we have by the way when you doing the N plus one does The X ever change so this guy is going to beat there no matter what x - 2 the N does though we get n + 1 over n + 1 2 * 3 n + 1 oh goodness and I'm forgetting something what else am I forgetting yeah you're right is that important yes an absolute value forget your absolute value look at what happens look it if you forget absolute value you lose this don't you you lose your other side of your interval that's a problem okay so oh my gosh from here is there anything that we can get rid of automatically right now no there's no netive 1 is not like that alternating idea so we'd have to go through and multiply by the reciprocal as and yes absolutely you got to simplify as much as you can do we drop the absolute values right now no oh no the x is for sure we can't drop that so we got x - 2 to the n + 1 we got n + 1 2ar we got 3 n + 1 no problem now multiply by the reciprocal we got n^2 * 3 n we got x - 2 to the n and then we still have absolute value I I promise you the simplification gets way easier when you get used to this right off the bat you're like oh my gosh what are you doing but when you get used to it it gets really quick it'ss really nice you get used to what a plus one and a plus two mean as a power and you can simplifly stuff really fast have you already done it yeah probably tell me something that does simplify yeah that's the first thing I see two so if I simplify 3 to the N with 3 n+ 1 I get and it's on the denominator yeah yes how about the n s of the n+1 squ no you can't touch that can't touch this okay don't do that I'm not wearing my hammer pants but I should be um you can cross out the xus 2 N the Bott sure sure these are the same except that this has an extra x - 2 so if I do this and have the extra x - 2 then what we end up getting you know well we're not going to have much time after in this anyway so I'll race this what we end up getting is a limit and approaches Infinity do I still need the absolute value what's on my numerator please [Music] over okay x - 2 no problem n s no problem 3 no problem n + 1 squ no problem show hands feel okay with that here's what you do now please be careful what you do now you collect your n terms you do not collect constants and X's those are important so collect your end terms what I mean is that this stuff I'm going to move this off to the side I'm going to get a limit see if you can stick with me here n/ n +1 squared do you see it n / n +1 squar notice how I don't have an absolute value it's always going be positive then I have an absolute value of x - 2 over 3 collect everything except for your X values and your constants does that make sense to you yeah honestly are you guys okay with that how much is n n + 1 as n goes and what's one squ one so this whole thing is no so what is this whole Li actually I'm going to do this for you does this absolute value affect the three at all no that's what we get show should be okay with that so far now here's the question what test did we just use raest when does the ratio test show convergence when the limit is less than again this is by ratio test that's why we're doing it because ratio test says that our power series any series converges at the limit is less than one no problem so this power series make the limit less than one therefore you guarantee this thing is going to be converted does that make sense definitely have that okay now what that tells us is that if I multiply by three If I multiply by 3 what I end up getting is absolute value of x - 2 is less than 3 you guys okay with that one if you're wonder why are you multiplying by three now here's what I'm trying to do a lot of students get confused how in the world do I my radius of convergence is my radius of convergence one is it three is it five here's how you tell see the thing that's being ra to the N power over there the x - 2 as soon as you isolate that as soon as you isolate that x - 2 x - 2 in absolute value as soon as you isolate that that is your radius does that make sense so the radius is perfect radius of convergence is three that's what this says right now so I'm going to put this right here we already know the radius of convergence is three now from here all you got to do is find the interval of convergence and it's so easy it's really easy all you got to do is solve for x so if you solve for x what an absolute value inequality means is you do -3 is less than x - 2 is less than 3 that's what an absolute value inequality is right there then if we add two we find our domain3 if you simply add two so be okay with with that so far so this is why you do your radius first because right now it's kind of hard to see it's not super difficult you can still do it by the way what number is at the very center of this two 2 + 3 five 2 - 3 Bo yeah radius is three Center is two now what about the end points can we do that real quick we do it I'll do it here um you know what I'm going to race this I'm going to do it over here we're going to test your end points here so last little bit end points so for our end points we need what's what's our first endpoint we checked don't be silly and check this that's silly okay make sure you solve for x to find your domain this is the end points of your interval right here so we do1 and we do five so if I'm plugging inga1 what we end up getting remember I'm plugging in negative 1 right here we end up getting -3 n over n^ 2 * 3 to the N what that gives you if you look at this real carefully what this gives you is what kind of it's kind almost you're so close you said one thing wrong but almost do you notice how they both have the power yeah so you can make -3 1 over 3 to the N right geometric Time 1 n^ 2 no not geometric do you see that this is3 3 to the n * 1 n okay it's on denominator how much is33 -1 to the n * 1 n 2 N = one to Infinity tell me something about this series Ser it's not a p series Al alternating series you can do a few tests with this one if you wanted to if you want to be really quick about it if you want to be real quick about it do absolute convergence absolute convergence gives you 1/ n s yeah P series booah done this series converges absolutely if you don't need absolute convergence which you don't you just do alternating series test so that's what I'll do because I don't need absolute convergence I'll do by alternating series test it's pretty clear that the limit is zero it's very clear that this is decreasing limit zero decreasing alternating series by alternating series test convergent are you guys okay with that one could you have shown it a different way absolutely you could used absolute convergence done absolute value this is gone 1 n s is a p series because the absolute value of series converges our series is absolutely convergent therefore it is convergent end point no matter what is included number uh plug in five if we do that we get n = 1 to Infinity of 3 to the N over n^2 * this one's even easier how much is 3 to the N over 3 the n one one one over n tell me something about 1 over n s say what now that's a p Series yeah tell me about the P series P oh get too fast P series P equal 2 that's greater than one do you notice how what we're doing look it we're putting like everything we know together right I'm going to go through it one time here real fast to show you what we're doing we're doing ratio test to give us an interval that lets us know when our power series converges when it represents a function we're using all the stuff that we've learned already to do our end points we're saying hey alary series test or absolute convergence or a p series or a geometric or whatever you have to show that our end points are or are not included so here's what we got the radius of convergence is three the interval of convergence is -1 to 5 we already have that now tell me about the end points both brackets that's what we're talking about here's what it means it means that this series represents a function of X that converges for 1 to 5 and that's it make sense that's F all right so let's do it the last example before we get on to the calculus of power series uh from before we know that that right there whenever we have an X raised to a power of n we have this thing that creates a function of X that's our power series what we are focused on doing is how to find the interval of convergence the rat convergence where this thing converges firstly notice something about this power series where's the center the center is zero sorry Z zero that's right which means that whatever interval we get it's going to be centered around zero plus or minus some number whether that radius that number is zero infinity or an actual finite number this interval of convergence is going to be centered right at zero and you found three cases so far you found those cases on your homework where it converges only when x equals 0 and diverges elsewhere that's the most limited most limited amount does that make sense you found the cases where it converges at the center and some radius around it where that radius is a finite number and then we have to check end points of course where whether it converges to end points or not that used the stuff we learned before and then that's kind of the the second case the second least limited and then the least limited is where it converges all the time for any X and you hopefully if you've done your homework or some of it you've seen all three of those cases have you seen those cases yet by the way I do want to see where these things converge they will converge somewhere okay I want to see that I want you even if they go it diverges when X doesn't equal zero I want to see it converges when X does equal the center wherever that happens to be does that make sense okay so our last example says all right if that's a power series let's go ahead let's find out what the interval of convergence is what the radius convergence is what's going on with this thing how are we going to do that most of the time with this yeah usually it's a ratio test or maybe a root test but you want some test that lets you determine the interval or the radius convergence that says hey it's going to converge when this is less than some number when this happens because that gives us that interval so let's go ahead let's start do you guys want to try this one on your own see if you can do it let's start with the ratio test write out the ratio test and see if you can do it as you're working through this can you tell me some of the key points about the ratio test that we need to know say what no it would take away the alter it would why what what part of the ratio test takes away the negative one absolute okay so ratio test has absolute value in it no problem uh what are some other key points about the ratio test that we need to know specifically what goes on the main numerator a subn or a subn plus 1 okay that's pretty good do you know anything about the convergence of the ratio test when does the ratio test converge very good when limit is less than one and it diverges when the limit is greater than one this is going to be a nasty one isn't it let's see if you all got this we got1 the n + 1 we got 2 to the n + 1 we got x to the n + 1 we got Square < TK of n + two do you see where that's all coming from yeah all right cool we're just taking n plus1 and put in here and here and here and here and then all over a subn so-1 the N not a problem 2 the n x the N Square < TK of n + 2 show hands if you made it at least that far I'm sorry one hopefully you didn't make it that far I just like twos today n plus one did you make it that far yeah fantastic you know the ratio test all right so now what do we do as much as you can so simplif means get rid of your1 n + 1's or 1 n because absolute value gets rid of those things it also means take your complex fraction and rewrite it do I get rid of my absolute value with a ratio test in a power series no not generally unless you have something like X squ where it doesn't matter sure but not generally no so we're going to have absolute value still we'll have 2 n + 1 * x n + 1 all over < TK of n + 2 times the reciprocal of our main denominator that would be the square root of n + 1 over well the negative 1es those are gone our absolute value does that for us we get that did you get that far on your own yeah okay now before you go any further what are we going to do yeah as much as you can simplify and then after we simplify we're going to strip off our n terms and leave our X terms we're going to separate those things so when we do this I'm going to go through it quickly I've always explained it a few times to you when we simplify you're going to have a lot of common bases raised to different powers just understand that a plus one simply means you're multiplying by two a plus one here means you're multiplying by an X so what we're going to do we're going to collect our n terms if you notice this here's a < TK of n +1 over squ < TK of n + 2 I can make a big square root of n +1 n + 2 we're going to do that so n + 1 n + 2 as the radican of our square root and then we got what else is up there abute value 2 2x okay if this is all an absolute value tell me what do I do what can I pull out of the absolute value right now because it'll never be negative good how about the two could I pull that out you know what could I pull out the two I could pull out the two so if I wanted to I could do a limit as n approaches Infinity of the sare < TK of n + 1/ n + 2 time 2 time theun of X I could do that absolute what did I say oh man sorry too much painting I told you brain kind of my bad so square root of n plus I just like square roots in Tuesday don't worry about it squ of n plus 1 over n plus 2 * 2times the absolute value of x oh my gosh tell me one more thing that we got here what's going on Li the limit what's a what's the square root of n + 1/ n + 2 as n approaches Infinity inside of our limit what's this do yeah use all that stuff about limits that you know n over well if you divide by largest power of n or you do low TS inside your square root whatever you want to consider this whole thing goes to one so what's our limit equal very good okay let's put the whole thing together now what test did we just use Rao and when do we know that the ratio test converges with the limit is less than one so if we just use a limit and say hey you know what we use ra chest to find our limit and we know that when the limit is less than one we know that this power series converges remember that a power series represents a function only when that power series converges so that's the whole idea here behind you is the ratio test is we want to find out when that actually converges so we know the domain of our function the domain of our function for which our power series converges show F feel okay with that idea I know explained this a couple times I'm make sure you're with it do I stop here no no no but we're we're getting there what we know is that 2 absolute value of x is less than one gives us our interval of convergence for our power series for which our function will Define that that's our domain now what we do here is we always trying to find the absolute value of whatever is being raised to the N power isolated all by itself on one side of our inequality what that does that will give you your radius of convergence have I told you that before yes so what you're looking for here is hey if it's x to the N I want X all by itself inside of an absolute value on one side of my inequality so if I divide by two on both sides that right there as soon as you isolate they go oh cool look at that hey this is what's being rais my power it's isolated it's my inside my absolute value right now you should be able to tell me the radius of convergence what is it very good so this right here says the radius of convergence is2 now we keep going a little bit we we write out the definition of what an absolute value inequality is absolute value inequality says if you have the absolute value of x less than 1 12 that means that -2 is less than x is less than 12 and we're almost done are you guys okay with that one yeah almost done what do we do next check end points we got to check those end points because right now yeah we have the radius we know it's going to be 1/2 we have the center notice how the center zero is right in between 1/2 to 1/2 what we don't know is whether these two end points are included or not that doesn't give us this is the ratio test it doesn't give us it by just doing the simple mathematics we got to check the end points individually where do we check the end points say what origal original one so plug in in let's see if we plug in where we where do we plug in the 1/2 and thetive one2 it seems that way right because X is between those things so if x becomes one2 we're going to find out whether that converges or diverges for that specific end point same thing with positive one2 which one do you guys want to do first Okay negative does it matter no no go left to right so if we're going to check the end point - one2 we're going to plug it in here and get a series N = 0 to Infinity of1 to the N we're going to have 2 to the n and we're what's what's the next thing yep all over the square root of n+1 now because you did all that stuff in the previous sections these on should be pretty easy these are going to be nice things that you recognize oh yeah we could do this with it we can do alternating series test or absolute convergence or we could do another ratio test if you really really want to or we could do a p series or a limit comparison test all those things open up right now because we don't have any more X's we have all constants so simplify before you check them but it's going to be something familiar so here's here how I would look at this one nth power nth power nth power you see if I can make all those things to One n power yes well then we have 1 * 2 * -2 how much is1 * 2 * 12 POS 1 so this whole thing gives us a series from 0 to Infinity of positive one to the N over the < TK n + 1 okay well wait a minute how much is 1 to the n one so no matter what do you guys notice that when I have a negative time a negative that that gets rid of that idea of alternating series for this is not alternating it's just one to the N or simply one all the time so we don't need that n anymore now tell me something about this series can you work with it can you do something with it compar okay if we compared it please listen carefully I want to walk you through this because I don't want you wasting your time you need to think about it and and I like that you're thinking about it but if you compared it this is less than 1 n correct and this is 1 n 1/2 which is a Divergent P series are you clear on that yes this thing diverges this is less than that does it tell you anything this is inconclusive that does not help us at all so even though we can compare it we're comparing it to something that is bigger and Divergent that doesn't make sense we want bigger and convergent that would be great but this is not that does that make sense could you use a limit comparison test that you could do if you did a limit comparison test then the series of 1 the n + one compares to the series of 1 overun n sure no problem if you did the limit since these both have positive terms we'd have < TK of n + 1 over 1 n as n approaches Infinity this should kind of be old hat for you right you guys have seen this before I know and this would give you one more I mean when you work through it that's going to give you one quick Head n if you're okay with with that one now next question if that gives you one this is a limit comparison test is that inconclusive or do you know something about this you know something you know something with a limit comparison test if the limit equals a number I don't care what it is if it just exists if the limit exists then both both of these Series have the same result tell me something about this this series tell me something about this series then so by the very good by the limit comparison test we said this all right this one acts just like that think of the end behavior of your function this one acts just like this one if I compare them in a limit a limit comparison test them in limit and that limit exists they both have the same result if one diverges the other diverges if one converges the other converges so we base this our given series on a series we already know the result for whether it's convergent or Divergent doesn't matter they're going to have the same result so both series diverge by a limit comparison test since that was a p series with P = 12 oops okay so let's put this into into play here is the end point negative one2 going to be included in our domain of our power series okay so since this thing diverges we are not going to include one2 can I show you something else a different way to think about this it's a little weird but I want to open your mind to something a little bit different you don't actually have to use a compar test to do this I'll show you this one check it sometimes you can manipulate your Series in such a way to change it from what it is to what you want it to be and here's how you would do that in this case so notice something if we start with n equals 0 what we're going to get is a square Ro T of 0 + 1 do you get that well you can manipulate these series as long as you start with the same thing and it follows the same pattern for instance instead of doing a series from n 0 to one Sor sorry 0 to Infinity if I start it at one then what changes about this is instead of have n + one inside of my square root all I need is something that takes this number and Maps it to the same place that this did so for instance here's one here's one here's square root square root here's n here's n here's plus one okay when I plug in my zero I get zero right when I plug in my one I need to get zero n minus one does that make sense to you it's doing the same thing think about that if I plug in zero here I get uh one over 1 if I plug in one here I get 1 over 1 if I plug in two here I get 1 over 3 plug in two here I get one over three sorry uh what did I say two here yeah right so plug in the next one it maps to the same fraction well if that's true then this becomes tell me something about that one so this becomes the same exact Series this is a Divergent P series you can do it a different way I just want to show you that one is it super important probably not you can do a limit comparison test and get the same result but I wanted to open your mind just a little something else so hands if that made sense to you okay cool we're almost done what's the last thing that we got to do here yeah let's do that one let's do the positive one2 so if we do2 the series will look really similar except instead a negative 1/2 we get positive2 what's going to happen with our numerator let's simplify that what do we get a that's right we we don't have that negative we had here so when I had negative * negative gives it a positive I don't have that here so our series does look really really similar it's still going to be a one but it's it's a negative one to the N over the < TK of n +1 now this one oh man this should be ringing some Bells tell me something about this series that you know right now it's alternating all right so alternating series we take the limit what's the limit of that series Zer Z remember doing that limit is n approach Infinity is zero if the if the sequence from which we get our alternative series goes to zero that's like the Divergence test for our alternative series next up is our series well what's the next thing have to be is it decreasing term by term yeah and that's really easy to show so we'd say the limit of 1/ s n + one that's our a subn so to get our a subn you cover up this you go okay what's remaining after I take away the alternating part that's our a subn if the limit as n approaches Infinity gives you a zero that's like passing the Divergence test and saying okay it's not maybe not Divergent you keep on going after that you say is it decreasing is a sub n +1 which is 1 < TK n + 2 is that less than 1un n + 1 which is our a subn if that's true which it is here this is definitely less than that for n greater than equal to one this says it's decreasing so by the alternating series test we get convergence let's put the whole thing together then uh do you know what your interval of convergence is oh interval your interval of convergence do we know what it is right now yes where's it start ladies and gentlemen is ative 1/2 included no no where does it end is a 1/2 included yes so we know the radius is 1 12 we know the center is zero we know our interval we know everything about this so for our last example I want to make it real clear make sure you guys are really good at this we got these things called Power series which are functions power series have an X in there so when I write out the series I get a function of X now that function is only defined where that series converges that definition that that's our domain so what can X be in order to make this thing convergent that's how we go through all this mess we go okay well what what's X got to be for that to work what's X got to be for a series to converge so that Define a function of X we get all the way down to here we say okay whenever I have my whatever's being raised to the N power isolated inside my absolute value this right here is your radius if this had been an x - 3 I would want an xus 3 here before I determine my radius does that make sense to you after that after we determine the radius that's all fine and good we get our interval and then we check our end points the end points are going to be done with something you've done before in this class uh either an alternating series test or a limit comparison test or another test that we have integral testing I don't care what you use as long as you can test this thing out if you get for an endpoint that a series diverges that endpoint's not included in your domain that makes this power series convergent so defines our power series if you get that the series when you plug in that n point for X does converge then the end point is included and this is what we're looking for the radius the center and our interval of convergence that makes this power series work makes it converge therefore we can define a function by by using that domain have I explained everything well enough for you guys to understand it are you sure I don't want to leave anything hanging do you guys get the idea can you do it yourselves okay then the last thing we talk about in this section is how to actually do calculus with these power series which is weird like what uh calculus what do you mean how do we do derivatives and how do we do integrals of power series and honestly it's not that hard but it leads us to something very very interesting it's kind of like our our stepping stone between this section and the next section which is Taylor polinomial and mclen uh polinomial well well Taylor series and the chor series that leads to [Music] Taylor but firstly we got to learn how to do derivatives and integrals of power series well how in the world are we going to do that well you know what let's start with something general let's just just build on it so let's assume that we have this power Series so f ofx is a power series starting at zero going to Infinity a subn xus c to the N let's talk about the terms of what the series is going to look like so we're going to say here that we have some power series it will converge for some domain of X therefore we're going to have this function so where our power series converges that's our domain for our function okie dokie now what do the terms look like what's the first term yeah a sub what a a sub Z how about xus C is that going to be up there no no because it's being raised to the zero power that gives us one so we just get a sub Z Plus what what the next term going to look like sub one very good to the plus what uhhuh power good now we're getting the pattern a sub 3 x - c to the 3r and it doesn't end well here's the cool thing um you know about derivatives right derivatives say okay well take your take your function and when you do a derivative we basically just derive it term by term don't we and when we have pluses or minuses we know that with derivatives we can separate those pluses or minuses and just do the deriver of that term put it back together with the sign you're good to go well if you think about it when I do all my terms tell me what a sub Z and a sub 1 and a sub 2 and a sub 3 and a sub 4 and all my a sub ns are in reality are they variables or are they constants so no matter what that's going to be a constant that's going to be a constant that's going to be a constant that's going to be a constant and so forth and so on the only place I have things to derive because I have a function of x if I'm trying to find frime of X the variable is X here the only place I have my variable is here and here and here and so forth and so on does that make sense to you so we notice that when we take derivatives here am I going to need a power or sorry product rule here no that's a that's a like a coefficient okay it's like three or seven I don't care what it is it's a coefficient so what we do with this is yeah if we have just a constant by itself what's the derivative of a constant okay so we're going to take a derivative term by term the derivative of a sub Z is gone I don't care what it is it's a constant when der that it's gone so frime of X gives us firstly zero I'm going to write the zero just so we see what what's going on with that okay say derivative of a constant Man Zero what's the derivative of this guy what's that going to be not one no if this was 3x - c it wouldn't be zero it would be 3 * 1 x - c to 0 power * the derivative of the inside which is one and this is one this is please don't forget your basic calculus okay it's just the chain rule folks it's you bring down the power you multiply by the inside good to go so this would be in this case what don't say three it was just an example a sub one that's right a sub [Laughter] one what Okay Plus what are you going to do with this if that's a coefficient like three you're going to bring down the two aren't you you're going to have two * a sub 2 you're going to have your inside x - c you're going to raise it to 1 power less than what you had to the first Power and you're going to multiply by the derivative of which is one all the time it's centered at C it's just going to be xus C it's one all the time so that's great so we're using using the chain rule yeah but what we're really doing is saying okay well derivative of a constant is zero that's a coefficient I know that some you go well wait a minute a constant der of constant zero well yeah it is if it's by itself with no variable if not then you're using kind of technically using the product rule all the time it's just the derivative of a constant gives you zero so you emit half of it and you're using the chain rule you're bringing down your power you're multiplying you're taking one away from that and using the chain rule multiply by der inside the Der inside is always one you with me yeah so tell me what the next one's going to 3 and so on and so on and so on and so on forever and ever and ever but look at what this really this is so cool the way this actually works check out what happens so F Prime of X really just does this um first thing tell me where our series actually starts now you see our series here started at zero we had a Sub 0 where's our new our derivative start a sub 1 it doesn't start at a Sub 0 anymore it starts at a sub 1 why well because the derivative of our very first term gentlemen uh gets rid of that constant so this thing is gone we start at a sub one question well the a sub one because you know you said you're bring that the variable down and leave the inside alone so where's the x- C attach to a sub one right here on that one yeah that one the Dera of that what's oneus one never mind okay you're right it happens I know I'm right right I like hearing that though still especially for my wife that never happens but uh espe she's my anyway um so here's what goes on when you take the derivative of a power series your first term is a constant it goes away so we don't have the zeroth term anymore we start at the a sub one term or when n equals 1 does that are you with me now what's happened here is for every single term that we've had we've taken the power we've moved it down but notice one 1 2 2 3 3 n n we're moving the N power forward we're leaving the a subn alone actually a sub 1 okay a sub 2 a sub a sub 1 a sub 2 a sub 3 no problem and we're doing x - c to what's going on to our power what are we doing with it do you see that this from here to here look at look at that it should look very familiar to you from here to here do you see that that is just the chain oh that's all that is it's just or the general power rule if you learned it as general power rule says hey take your take power move it down front no problem we got that um that's a coefficient leave it that inside of something chain rule leave it subtract one from your exponent no problem multiply by derivative of the inside hey it's one it's just the chain rule that's all this is it's just very cool that that still works for our power series maybe it's not that cool maybe it's obvious to you because a subn is a constant anyway uh but most wow that's kind of neat but when you think about it it should be apparent it should be well if that's a constant that's a constant time something X raised to a power you can use the chain rule with it you guys with me okay next one so we had let's call this part A derivatives Part B integrals if I do the integral of f ofx DX let's go right from here if I integrate term by term which I can do because if I can dve term by term I can integrate term by term no big deal we've done that for years now if I integrate if I integrate term by term what's this going to is it going to be a zero no integrals don't work like that if I do like one minus or plus X DX the integral of one becomes okay sure so I'd get like x + X2 2 so okay now here when I do my integration it's not just going to be a0x it's going to be a sub 0 x - c but the same idea basically happens it'd be like integrating with a u with a substitution kind of like that where you'd have 1 + x - 3 say squared or not squared you just do it like that you'd use a substitution wouldn't you you'd make u = x - 3 and you go okay well no problem then when I do an integral that would be U and when I did my U Back to my x's I'd get x - 3 same things happen in here does that make sense to you okay so we get a okay no problem what's the next one then oh come on that's yeah am I going to have an xus C what power is it going to be raised two over next one and so on and so forth which looks like this the integral of FX DX therefore would simply be a Series this one does start at zero still we get a subn we get x - c to the let's look at what happened into our power what's happening every single time we had we didn't even have an xus C now we have one to the first we had an x- C but now it's to the second that's right over what that's right does that look familiar too that's our basic integration rule it just says hey you know what what happens here uh you take this you add one to your exponent bam you divide by your new exponent got it we don't need to do worry about the x- C because when you do a substitution it's like the most trivial of substitutions the derivative x- C is one Therefore your DX is a straight substitution to the DU whatever you use for your substitution and we got it should P feel okay with this so far you shouldn't there's one thing I'm missing don't forget the plus C you see you see now uh there is one other thing that can happen you see all of these Series start out with an interval of convergence right some domain so it's like from like we had before 1/2 to 1/2 where sometimes the end points are included and sometimes they are not included now what can happen is if you do a derivative or if you do an integral of your power series you can lose end points or you can gain end points what's interesting is the interval of convergence will remain the same the interval is the same but you can lose end points on derivatives and you can gain convergence of end points on integrals does that make sense to you so it's really it's kind of an interesting idea but when you do a derivative or integral of your power series all you need to know is that the interval is not going to change but the end points might so be careful on that one show pans feel okay with the idea now I'm going to show you one example on how to use this very quickly what we're going to do and this is going to be our stepping stone into the next section I want to find a power series representation for this for Ln of 1 - x on the interval -1 to one I want to find a power series representation for that thing what we're going to do what we're going to do is we're going to use this idea to do that so here's the start are you ready for the start I'm looking for some some function that when I take a derivative or an integral of it it gives me Ln of 1 - x I'm I'll say it again I'm looking for some function that when I do a derivative or an integral it gives me this thing right there does that make sense to you now I'm going to cut to the chase because I'm running out of time I want to make sure that you get this well here's a deal I know that if I start with 1 over 1 - x and I do an integral of that thing the integral is going to be pretty darn close to that do you see that it's going to be negative but it's going to be pretty darn close are you with me on this folks so the integral of this this thing gives us negative Ln of 1 - x quick head out if you're okay with that okay now the other reason why I'm choosing this one why I'm not saying well tell me something I do a derivative for that I'm also trying to make a series representation what I know is that this thing right here this is so cool this is the sum of a what type series do you see it that's a sum of a geometric Series this is the sum of a geometric series gec power of a geometric series with okay you tell me if this is a geometric series what's my a one very good a is right here what's my r therefore this is a geometric series with n = 1 to Infinity of 1 what else do you remember how uh geometric series look geometric series look a r to the nus1 so a * R to the nus1 that's it that's my geometric series okay well that's cool or you could do it this way if you want we all see this way Nal 0 to Infinity of a x to the N either way in both of these cases in both of these cases what do the terms of your series look like what's the first term here good notice the first term here would also be one you with me so I don't care how you do e either way this one's a little easier to see okay but either way if you did that you'd probably raise to one but if you did this you'd still get one plus what's the next term come on we got to this one x to the sure plus what else plus what else plus what else and so forth and so on okay I feel like I've lost some I've left you in the dust a little bit CU I'm getting some blank looks I never like the blank looks you know you know sometimes when I speak uh Spanish to my dog he goes uh it's a little bit never mind anyway yeah this this is a little greek I I get it it's a little weird find a power series representation for that thing what we're trying to do is say hey you know what I've got a function that represents I'm sorry I have a power series that represents this function on that interval we'll talk about why the interval is there right now actually um first thing we do is say hey find me something that when I take an integral of it it gives me this thing or that thing with a positive or negative I don't care as long as it's this thing CU negatives I can deal with well I know that if I integrate this it is going to give me this what I also know is that this thing is the sum of a geometric series with AAL 1 and with Ral X look up the geometric Series this is going to be apparent to you well a geometric series is always one of these two forms no problem it's a it's a it's n = 1 1 with nus one or Z with n and it's R to that power that's exactly what we have right here so if feel okay with with that now those terms are 1 + x + X2 + x plus x 4 plus blah blah blah blah blah blah blah this how geometric series look okay now can someone out there who's thinking critically explain me why this interval is the way that it is why X must be between -1 and 1 for this of oneide kind because of absolute value of R is greater than one why why is the absolute value of R less than one or greater than one important for us conver or diver what type of series do we have so if this if this is not negative 1: one then my X which is my R would be outside of the interval of convergence does that make sense geometric series only converge from1 to 1 hey it's a geometric Series so because it's a geometric X is r h you know what r r in this case since r must be less than one for convergence of a geometric series X must be less than one for the convergence of this geometric power series I want to write that out because it's important make sure that you actually get that do you you guys notice understand the concept here the reason why this is defined only on negative 1 to one is because we are going to be using a power series to represent this we have to use a power sorry GE geometric power series to represent this because geometric series only converge when this number is between 1 and 1 it must converge when this number is between negative okay between well X has to be between 1 and 1 that's the only way that this thing is going to converge therefore it's the only way that we're going to get a function to represent this power a power series represent this function power series only represent functions where the series converge therefore we have to have an interval for which our power series is going to converge to represent this function does that make sense okay almost there very very close to almost there well what we have right now is this we got this is the sum of a power Series this power series looks like this therefore one over 1 - x is = to 1 + x + X2 + x 3r + forever never never never what I also know about equations can you guys make the jump with me what I also know about equations I can integrate both sides and since I know how to integrate a power series I can integrate term by term that's where we're making this jump you're saying hey integrate that term by term well check it out what's the integral of 1 1 - x what's it's really not it's not L it's not this it's not that it's close but it's not that it's negative do you know why you'd have a u u sub 1 - x du = DX that gives us that negative does that make sense now I'm not going to do a plus c here I am on the other side I'm not doing a plus c because very similar to our differential equation section if I did a plus c I could just subtract it and get a different constant okay so I'm not going to worry about it here I'm going to get x + x^2 / 2 + x 3r 3 plus blah blah blah blah blah and then plus C at the very end so close almost done tell me what I could do with that negative say what now if I divide by negative all these signs are going to change I'll get Ln 1 - x = - x^2 2 - x 3 3us blah blah blah blah blah minus C so close almost done oh we got to find out what C is equal to so if we want to find out what C is equal to it's pretty easy to do do you understand that every single one of these terms are going to have an X in it except for my C plug in xal Z if you do that everything goes to zero except for my C so if I let X = 0 I get Ln of 1 = C Ln of 1 = C how much is Ln of one so then 0 equals c okay so Ln of 1 - x = X - x^2 / 2 - x 3r over 3 minus blah blah blah blah but no plus C if we factor out that netive which we could have done from the very beginning we could have had Negative X + x^2 / 2 + x 3r 3 plus blah blah blah blah blah all we got to do is find a power a series representation for that thing and it will'll be done and that's really easy to do what this is can you represent that thing as a series The probably x x is going to be up there somewhere yeah uh to what over yeah do you guys see it 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 NN where's n start it starts at one it goes to Infinity so here's what we know we can represent this function Ln of 1 - x by this series on what interval why was1 to1 important because that's really a geometric series that's where we got this from okay we can't Define it other than that so what this says is that on negative 1:1 this thing is going to converge and it will represent this function so if you wanted to find out hey what's uh Ln of 1 - 12 you could actually plug in 12 here here here here here and do it for Infinity it's going to be exactly the same thing it's going to represent that function exactly on this interval as long as you go and to Infinity does that make sense to you this kind of out there stuff but what we just did is we took a function and we use a power series to represent that function on a given interval that for which our series converged so depends if this one makes sense to you okay any questions or comments at all before we stop all right I 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 9.8:  Representation of Functions by Taylor Series and Maclauren Series
all right putting everything together now we're going to talk about Taylor series and mcloren series now what this is what this basic idea is all about is how to represent a function with a power series let's go through some of the theory behind this all right so firstly if a function f has a power series or let's let's do it this way suppose suppose the function f has a power series repres well then a few things are true the first thing we we know and let's suppose this is at the point C the first thing we know is true is that F ofx would equal a series from n = 0 to Infinity of a subn x - c to the N you see where the x - c is coming from if this is a power series representation at C well then we can say okay it's going to be x - c to some Power Times some sequence of terms and then we add them all up together you guys okay with that so far that is a power Series right in fact that's a general form of a power series even if C is zero that's still the power series that represent that so if we have a function that can be represented by a power series it's going to look like like this somehow show FP right with that one that's just all we're saying it says if F has a power representation it's going to look like that now what we're going to state next is this if this is true if we have a power series representation because we have these terms the the the sequence of terms where we get our series from all of these as subn are going to be constants true or false which means the x is coefficients yeah as n goes from Z to Infinity then we're going to have X basically x to the 0 x to the 1 x to the 2 x to the 3 x to the N correct what that means is that for sure if this means makes a power series we're going to have a whole bunch of terms right wherever we stop is going to be the nth term does that make sense to you that's going to be x to the N what that means is that the F to the N derivative must exist it's got to be there because what we're going to end up getting is whole bunch of coefficients these are constants fractions I don't care what they R it's going to be something time x to the blank power and that n power means that you could take a whole bunch of derivatives couldn't you hello yes no if I had like three terms I could take up to a third derivative and it's going to be there it's going to be a constant actually well that's going to be you say okay bring down the power subtract one from it that's first derivative bring down the power subtract one from it that's a second dtive bring down the third power subtract one from it that's a fourth third derivative and so on you can do that up to the nth derivative because there's going to be a power n somewhere in your power Series in your list of terms does that make sense so then we say all right well then the nth derivative of f exists at C and the way we write that is f to the well not F to the I'm sorry um the N derivative of F at C that's what that says I'll go through it one more time just so that that makes sense to you and then I'm going to show you what we can do with this thing this is going to be interesting this is where we're going to get our tailor series from so here's the idea one one more time if F has a power series representation at C then this is for sure true then F can be represented by a power series not a problem a power series just X to some power if we have X to some power n and we list out all of these terms and we start taking derivatives then the first derivative is going to exist and the second one and the third one and the fourth one all the way up into the nth derivative because what's going to happen is that our first term is going to go to zero it's constant our second term becomes a constant therefore when I take my next derivative that term goes to zero that's going to happen until we get down to our nth derivative our nth term ends end up turning into a constant at our n derivative does that make sense to you all the rest of them are going to be something like x - c to the whatever the the next term after the N1 n plus one that's going to be xus C to the 1 and then to the second then to the third then the fourth but we can take up to the nth derivative and it's going to exist somewhere at C just means hey plug in C not a problem show fans you feel okay that this is going to exist and this is going to make a little bit more sense when we go through the next thing I'm talking about the next thing I want to find out and I'm going to write St up here I'm going to erase it in just a minute this is just for to show you what what this is the last thing is I want to find out what a subn is in terms of my derivative in terms of that and we're going to do it this way you guys ready for it so we're going to come up with what a subn is the idea is what I'm trying to do is figure out basically a formula that's based on my function that I can put right here because if I can do that if I can base this on my function well then I can start building a power series from a specific function so here's the idea on this you know what I paper did it separately let's start with f ofx thank you you if F ofx has a power series representation then it's going to be represented by this thing in general it's going to be represented by this give me the first term of this power series a sub Z and it would be this to the zero give you one be a sub Z then I would get what's the next ter to the plus a uhhuh x - c 2 plus a plus blah blah blah blah blah all the way down until we get to n a sub a subn xus c to the good you guys okay with that one now this says we stop at n but in reality this thing would keep on going forever and ever and ever and ever and ever ever never ever because that thing does not end it goes to Infinity are you with me so far so here's the point I was trying to make earlier maybe you can see a little bit better now do you understand that if this is my power series representation it basically acts like a polinomial here it's going to be X is some power these are all constants that that they're coefficients of whatever X term we have what that means is could I take a first derivative sure could I take a second derivative could I take up to an nth derivative abolutely all it's going to happen is I take a d all these things n times or whatever n is five times seven times a million times times who cares if I have a millionth term then I can take a millionth derivative and then I can plug C in does that make sense now this going to get kind of interesting for us let's start taking derivatives if I take the first derivative I'm going to erase that if I take the first derivative frime of x help me out with this what do I get remember we did this in the last section this is why we we just did that is so that you understand that you can take a derivative of a power series that's why we did it CU now we're going to use the last idea that we had in the previous section right now so take your derivative what happens to a sub z0 that's gone what happens to a sub1 x - c what's that become a good plus what 2 a 2 oh good what Happ why why the two what are we going to get there so 2 * a sub 2 x - c to the first Power very good plus 3 a sub 3 a 3 x - c to the power now this is the one that I really want to focus on this one you see here's why I want to focus on that the what we get got from the nth term why I want to focus on that one is because when we get down to nth derivative do you understand all these things are ultimately going to go to zero they're all going to become constants so I'm really focused on this guy so what happens here oops and then we would continue you all okay with that one that's the one I want you to focus on to see what happens with this okay let's continue we're going to do like uh four derivatives three or four derivatives so just to get a really strong pattern here so let's do fpre of X okay tell me what happens come on you guys got it what happens here what happens here really what happens is you bring down the one don't you M you really get 2 * 1 do you see it a sorry a sub 2 x - C 0 but that's going to go away so I get 2 * 1 * a sub 2 2 A 2 yep now I don't want you to simplify because we're looking for a pattern here does that make sense for pattern okay next up it's three don't give me six I don't want six with this stuff we're really looking for a pattern here so it's 3 * 2 2 * a sub 3 x - c to the plus okay now remember this is the one I want to focus on right here what's going to happen good you'll bring down the N minus one then you multip byus two very good we okay with that so far okay it's going to keep on going let's do this is the last one that we'll do because the pattern is going to be apparent after this if we did a third derivative what happens to this term where's it go that's all that's all a constant that's gone does that make sense this one would be 3 * 2 * * 1 a sub 3 x - c to the Z that's going to go away that's going to be one are you with me you sure you're with me okay plus blah blah blah do you notice that what happens is that we're going to end up getting a constant for every single term that we have you with me so check this out when we did a first derivative what I ended with was a sub one term as a constant are you listening when I did my second derivative I ended with my a sub 2 term as a constant do you see it a sub3 had an X with it when I did my third derivative I end with my a sub3 term as a constant my a sub4 term would have an X to some power does that make sense okay now let's do our our next derivative uh what am I going to get from this term as a derivative a sub very good x c to plus blah blah blah blah blah forever and ever ever now we're going to make a big jump we're going to go down here and do the nth derivative firstly does this make sense to you where all these things are coming from hello yes no are you sure we're just doing derivatives we're doing chain rule no problem deriv inside's always one so we got it easy here what I'm trying to get you to see is the pattern that's taking place what we saw is that okay well when we work this down we got 21 we got 321 we're going to have 4 3 2 1 we're going to have 5 4 3 2 1 we're going to have 6 54 3 21 we're going to have n factorial somewhere in this problem do you see it also it says right here we have n we have n * n -1 n * n -1 * N - 2 that's a factorial idea start with 7 multiply by 6 multiply by 5 multi start with n multiply by nus 1 N - 2 and all the way down until you get to one are you with me also what's happening I wanted you to see this first derivative says a sub 1 is your constant term second dtive a sub2 is your constant term third derivative a sub3 is your constant term nth derivative a subn is your constant term so ultimately what we're going to get down to is every term before it is going to go to zero the a sub one term goes to zero a sub 2 term goes to zero a sub 3 term goes to zero a sub n minus one term is going to go to zero if we take the nth derivative do you get that at the nth derivative what's going to happen here is you've subtracted n minus n you you'll have n minus n there that would give you the zero does that make sense so we'd bring it down we'd have an N then we'd have an N minus one then we'd have an N minus 2 then we'd have multiply all the way down until you get 3 2 1 and then youd have an H sub B does that make sense are you sure it make sense we would have x - c to the n- n and then we'd keep on going this would be a blah blah blah blah blah but I want to talk about this for a bit I'll try to I'll try to have this be really stuck in your head because this is what this is what we're going to get our Taylor series from just a moment okay so so bear with me for just a second if you were to take the nth derivative of a function like this one if you were to do that and nth derivative means not the first not the second not the third not the fourth not the fifth not the sixth but do it forever and then go forever but do it to a certain point n what's going to happen is that every Power every term with a power less than n it's a polinomial that's going to go to zero do you get that every term is going to go to zero except for the nth term at the nth term you will have done so many derivatives the first thing you do is the n then you multiply by n minus one then nus 2 then nus 3 all the way down until you get to one does that make sense now the N minus n that's going to give you zero what happens to this final little piece here where's that where's that go this goes to one anything to the zero power is one so this is going to be gone so what we know is that if I take an N derivative what's going to happen here is because I'm taking this down every time and saying hey one more derivative I bring down the N minus 2 hey look at that one more derivative look at this my next derivative I'd bring down nus 3 do you get it my next der I bring down nus 4 nus 5 all the way until I get to N - n -1 and that would give me my 2 and then my 1 and then I'd have a subn but then I have x - c to the 0 because at my nth derivative it'd be n minus n and my n minus n would give me zero anything to Zer power gives me one this would be my very first term so hands feel okay with that now this doesn't stop but when I keep going every term past this is going to have some bunch of crap x - c to some power that's very un mathematical but I'm trying to get you the idea here does that make sense to you are you sure so my very my derivative my very first term is going to be n * all this junk and then a subn with no x- C but every term after that is going to have an xus C do you understand why this does not have an xus C do you understand what all these ones do anything past the the nth term is going to have an x -1 to one more power so when I take an N derivative I still have a power there that's not zero does does that make sense now let's write this better what is all that very good now what I care about what I don't care about I don't care about F the the nth derivative of F at The X what I want to do is this at C so we're going to make one little jump if this is true if the N root of f ofx is all this junk then if I want to find the N root of F at C let's think about what's going to happen please please bear in mind this is why I just asked the question do you understand that there's no x- n here or sorry uh xus what is that c c there's no x- C here but every other term is going to have an xus C do you get that yes do you understand that F of c means I plug in C for X yeah so if every one of these terms has an x minus C with it and I plug in C for my X what's cus C everything else is going to go to zero and the only thing I'm left with is this guy n factorial time B of N and that's it did that make sense to you it's kind of weird right but this is the idea now here's what's what's awesome about this can you solve for a subn mhm very easily this is where we're going to make the jump so I hope you caught on to this this if every other term has x- C when I plug in C C- C is Z all these things are gone this does not have any X's at all it's just a constant this is the first constant when I plug in C everything else is gone except for that constant this is n factorial this is still a subn let's solve for a subn if I solve for a subn I get a subn equals let's just divide both sides F the nth root of F at C / n factorial that ladies and gentlemen was what I was looking for over here well what that means is that if I have just solv for the as subn term this is really kind of a neat idea do you understand that this was all in general right I made no specific case about this whatsoever I said if this has a power representation we have this we can take derivatives of it no problem of course we can let's do derivatives this right here would be the nth der of F at X if I plug in C which wherever my power is centered I can do that if I plug in C everything's going to disappear except for this very last term this very last term it has a subn in it so if I want to solve for a of n i just divide what that means is that what we can do is change this power series becomes this power series why don't you tell me instead of having a subn here what am I going to put what am I going to put the N derivative of F at C it's hard to it looks weird it's Weir to say but the N derivative of F at C the nth derivative of F at C uh-huh and then what Over N factorial very good and then what okay I want to make sure that if there's any questions I answer them right now do you all do yall see what I'm talking about do you see that what this thing becomes what this is the same okay what this thing becomes is if I know this is true which I just proved it that it is if I know this is true instead of a subn I can have the N derivative of F at C divided n factorial and that is what goes right there should fans if that one made a little bit of sense to you okay what this is is a tailor Series this right here is the tailor series any questions question on this at all because I'm going to race this whole side you sure did it make sense to you just some basic derivatives maybe not so basic so this thing this series from 0 to Infinity of the nth derivative of F at C Over N factorial - n- * x - c to n let's look at how this would look okay just like the first few terms what's the first term let's plug what would you plug in to find the first term plug in zero okay so um if you plugged in zero what is it's not F to the 0o it's the you don't take a derivative of f yet you don't have it you take zero derivatives that's what that little N means it means if that was a one you take the first derivative if that was a two you take the second der that's a zero you don't take the derivative does that make sense x - C2 though what would that become that would be one all over Z factorial 0 factorial if you don't remember is defined as one so this would simply be F of C you don't take the derivative of f you plug in C that's the very first term here does that make sense to you the next term says Okay add to it now take the first derivative plug in C have x - c to the first Power all over 1 factorial we don't need that one factorial it's just one does that make sense to you are you sure do one more term and see if you can hang with me plus what's the next one take two derivatives plug in C divide by 2 factorial x - c to the do you see the pattern are you all okay with that pattern for sure for real yes no yes this series do you guys see that we get a series seriously do you see that we get a a series we get a series here we get hey take function plug in C no problem take the first derivative plug in C okay no problem multiply x - c 1 take the second der plug in C divide by two factori that's where this is coming from time x - c the 2 power that's how your factorial and your power always match up you keep on going going and going and going going for Infinity this right here this is called the tailor series now it's going to be a real pain in the rear but we're going to go ahead and do the mcloren series right now okay it's a lot of work to go from the Taylor series M series are you ready to do it okay going to take us about 30 seconds here's a mclen series um if C is zero that's a muren series super hard 30 seconds but it's a harder one take about 30 there's always a cat there's no catch it's easy it's it's not easy I mean it's the same thing um listen you know how like uh every square is a rectangle but not every rectangle is a square yeah it's kind of like that okay that's analogous to what we're doing here every mclen series is inherently a tailor series every tailor series is not a mclorin series a mclorin series is simply a tailor series with C equals z you with me so if C equals z you have yourself in the cor series if Cal 0 this becomes the mcor series are they different no you do exactly the same thing it just C is zero well it makes it a little bit nicer our notation becomes nicer so F ofx would now become for mcloren series a series from Nal 0 to Infinity um it would just be this it' be the N derivative notice how the N does not become zero it's the C that becomes zero so what it becomes is uh F the derivative of FF at what zero that's a mclorin series All Over N factorial and then what happens here xus so we just have do you see how it cleans it up a little bit a little bit nicer looking because you don't have that minus C you don't have the C you just have zero because we're playing Zer it's going to look exactly the same it's going to be F of Zero no derivative for the first one plus you take a first derivative at 0 over 1 factorial * X 1st plus the second derivative at 0 over 2 factorial * x 2 plus and then so on and so forth blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah okay quick show hands if you understand the notation and the ver the verbiage the idea of a mcloren series and the idea of a Taylor series and how they differ do you understand how they differ yes so on a test want to ask you for hey find the mcloren series represents this uh this function would you be able to do it well not right now but would you understand what I'm talking about yeah it's a tailor series with C equals done now here's a couple I'm not going to write these down but um couple pie of information are quite important firstly a function that has a power series representation will be represented by a tailor series it will be represented by a Taylor series the converse is not necessarily true but we kind of assume it to be true um if we find a tailor series based on the derivatives of some function that function that we get from that series usually represents our function very well we assume that to be true for this case there are cases where it doesn't but we assume it to be be true for us does that make sense so what that means is that if you got a function and you represent with the power series it's going to be a tayor series if you find some tailor series of function that you didn't know that series that you get usually represents the function if you base it on the derivatives of the function that you you're looking for that's what I'm trying to say can we please do an example to clear all this stuff up yes i' like through at least two of them the first one's really quick really nice and easy so here's how your question on a test will most likely look no matter what class you're you're you ever take in calculus this is typically how it looks so if we have a function like this and I say what I want you to do I want you to find the tailor series that represents this function at a certain point find the tailor series that represents this function at the point Cals Z can you please explain to me um another way that I could have worded this it would mean the same thing find The M bam do I have to say find the mcloren series at C equals z no no I just say find the mcloren series and that would be exactly the same thing as what I just said right here so if I say find a Taylor series that's equals zero this means find the series that's all it means you okay with that I'm going to give you the steps on how to do this if you follow these steps every time this is going to make your life a lot easier so here's the Steps step number one because our tailor series are based all on derivatives what you're looking for here and it's not that hard to actually do but it's hard to find the pattern so I said find the pattern is the hard part okay check it this part or i' rather where am I at this part this part never changes that's going to be n factorial this part never changes that's going to be x - c to the N or x to the N no problem whether you're dealing with mclen or a Tor tayor series okay all you're looking for all you're looking for is this guy or this guy that's what you're looking for does that make sense and if you have a c then it's not just going to be C it's going to be like centered at one or at or whatever you have it at it's going to be around that one point so you're going to have an act number what you're trying to find out is find a pattern that represents the N derivative of f so in order to find the pattern that represents the nth derivative of F at a certain point like zero or whatever number I give you in this case I gave you zero you need to start with the derivatives so step number one is find several derivatives of your function start with several derivatives of your function so find derivatives of F and I want you to start looking for a pattern so I'm going to do that right here and we're going to do another uh column right next to it so leave yourself some space so we start with uh start with the function itself f ofx equals what please now I think I gave you probably the easiest example in the world right now okay what's the derivative of x oh oh but wait what's the next derivative okay but wait a minute how about the next one oh do it a lot okay do like typically I do three or four derivatives uh in this case this is pretty straightforward so we're not going to do that but you usually do like three or four derivatives what you're looking for is the pattern so that you can go down to here and say all right now I know what the nth derivative of f is you see you want a pattern so that you can plug in a number to that so if you know the nth derivative of x you can find the nth derivative of C zero or one or two or whatever sometimes it's not this easy I'll give you another way to do it in a minute uh but sometimes it is so you're looking for a pattern on your derivative if you can find one so what is it pretty good guys are Cham so number one find a derivative of F and look for a pattern number two plug in xal C it should stick with the same pattern sometimes you you you will definitely find a pattern here okay it's going to be apparent to you but what we're we're not really looking for this this is X the N derivative f f f at X I'm looking for at C so our next step is plug in xal C make sure you find the pattern here this is the big one so here's what I do over here I'd find F of C I want F Prime of C I want uh F dou Prime of C only in our case we know what our c is you're always going to know what your C is what is our C here Z so I don't want just F of C I'm really looking for f of Z and frime of zero and F Prime is of Z and F triple prime of Z and ultimately this is what I want I want f as an nth derivative of zero let's see if we can do this you see what we're doing here we're trying to find a pattern based on N for this thing so what's up hey what's F of Zer when I plug in what's frime of0 what's F Prime of 0 what's F triple prime of 0 do you see a pattern here what's F what's n derivative of F at zero if it never changes you're just going to get one show hands if that makes sense to you so if you can find a legit power uh sorry legit pattern for the nth der of f ofx all you got to do is plug in zero to right here it's going to work for you does that make sense to you sometimes this is really hard so besides doing just that we try to look for a pattern amongst these terms and we try work this down and get the n f at whatever point we're trying to find as soon as you find this everything else is easier everything else becomes really really easy are you ready for it to get really really easy are you sure so here we go just plug it in so if we want to find a tailor series at C equals 0 that's in the chlorin series then what what we know is that our function is going to equal a series that looks like this it's going to be f as an N derivative of F at Z over n factorial x - c to the N okay by definition by what we just proved this is the mccorn series this is a tailor series at oh actually I'm a little wrong this is the McLaren series if I just do x to the N it's a tailor series at zero because when I do zero I'd have x - 0 to N I would have a zero for my C show P feel okay with that one that is a mcor series that's a taor series at C equals 0 they're the same thing now all we got to do is did you notice why we only have to find one little piece of information all we're looking for here is that guy that's it this stays the same that stays the same it's that guy so we find our derivatives cool find a pattern if you can sometimes you can find a pattern if you can plug in the number c find a pattern definitely the where you have to do it whatever you get as the N of at C this whatever this is It's usually this is the most basic example I can even think of it's usually based in terms of n so base this in terms of N and put it right there you catch that so all you do is a little substitution so this thing changes to you tell me what's it changed to you what's uh the N derivative of F at zero what is it it's always one over what and then perfect that's exactly right exactly exactly so step number one find derivative step number two plug in xal C step number three as soon as you have this thing set up your series now step number four is where the fun begins step number four well hey does that look like something we have dealt with before in this class could you find me the interval of convergence yes ah does that sound familiar did you just do homework on that or should you have just done homework on that yes now you go through the ratio test or the root test or something that will give you the interval of conversion you see what we've just done here is we said cool this is awesome you know what that's that function has a power series representation at equal Z that's a mcloren series well we've just found the mclorin series but you need to tell me where it's good for the where it's good for is the domain the where it's good for is the X's that make the Ser series conversion remember that a function is only represented by a power series when that power series is convergent when we actually have a sum do you remember talking about that so we're looking for the interval of convergence the domain or the X's which makes make this power series convergent that will represent that function did did you catch all that it's in the previous section if you want to R review review back on the power series idea so last little thing step number four is find interval of convergence that is all the stuff we've just done are you starting to see how this this chapter because before it's like well does this even build at all are you starting to see now how this builds why we did all that junk we did all the the convergence tests because of the end points power series we did the power series The Ratio test for the power series and the root test for the power series we did power series for tailor series and my Florin series and we did those for approximation by taor polinomial which are do in the next section so here's our last thing find the interval of convergence you will I want say almost always you'll often times use the ratio test for this so I'm going to speed through this really fast this is not the section on learning the ratio test this a section on just using it now this is not a problem anymore this is part of our problem the problem really is right here as soon as you do this you've solved the problem the rest of this old stuff so we're going to do a ratio test limit as n approaches to Infinity absolute value this would become by the way you can simplify this make this x to the N Over N factorial instead of one you know make it a little easier for yourself x to the n + 1 over n +1 factorial all over x to the N Over N factorial so far so good do you see where all that comes from yes just our ratio test tell me when the ratio test says convergence when this limit is one that's why we're doing this to find the interval of convergence so we keep on going uh that's a limit should I drop the ACT value right now no oh please don't do that very good so we have x n + 1 / n +1 factorial not a problem and then n factorial over x to the N what now simplify let's do it we're going to do it fast this is gone we have n+ one this is gone we have X that gives us a limit as n approaches Infinity of remember what I told you about this collect your n terms separate off your X term so your n terms become 1 n + one yeah that doesn't have to be an absolute value because this end's always going to be positive we start at one but the absolute value of x that is important show P be okay with that so far now be careful on this you got to be really good at this this be able to determine what this limit's going to be what is this limit going to be all the time for anything that you plug in for X remember X has to be actual number can't be Infinity for anything you plug in for X is this going to be zero yeah it's something over infinity that gives you zero times whatever I got I don't care what that is this is going to be equal to zero for all X for all X you with me now now why is it important that we got a zero here does that help us at all ah this was the ratio test since zero is always less than one ratio for all X can you tell me what my interval of convergence is if I can plug in any X and I get zero Z is always good so if I can plug in anything that says my interval of convergence is any number this series listen carefully this series converges for any X do you get that anything we just proved it right there it's always 0 less than one by rati test a converion for any x what that means is that this function is represented by rorin series for any X any X you plug in I can represent it with this series so for all X means our interval of convergence would be interval of convergence is infinity to Infinity now if you're wondering why in the world are we doing this what what's the point here's the point what's kind of cool here's what we would say by the way uh we would say that f ofx = e to X this here's the point can be represented by the series Power series N = 0 to Infinity of x n/ n factorial uh that's just right here that's what we found and then you state the interval for which this thing converges which is the interval for which our power series works for a function on the interval negative Infinity to Infinity that's the appropriate way that you write out your answer you say hey the function that we started with don't forget what we're doing here what we're doing here is we're actually representing this function with this series says this function can be represented by this series on some given interval if this had been different we would have had to check end points remember checking end points do all that jump now since it's Infinity so well since our limit is zero we get ne INF to Infinity we don't got to check all that stuff but here's the point what you can do now is use this to approximate this for instance uh understand that this what this is this is a what is that well we we actually do it if I wanted to find F of two that would be e to the second power if I if I want to be as accurate as possible I didn't need a calculator whatever here's what I could do with that it's really cool notice how I have an e here does this have an e in it no yet when I do my series if we did this if I plug in zero I would get x to the 0 so I'd get 2 the 0 over 0 factorial I would get one one plus I plug in remember my X is two in this case are you with me on this my X would be two you know what maybe it' be easier if I did this uh f ofx is 1 plus if I pluged in one I get x to the 1 plus if I plugged in two i' get x2 over 2 then X 3r over 3 factorial then X 4th over 4 factorial do I have that right can you double check me on that one make sure I'm good am I yes no okay so if I want F of 2 basically if I want e^2 well I have 1 + 2 + 2^ 2 over 2 + 3 2 to3 over 3 factorial + 2 4th over 4 factorial and if I do that forever and add them all up I will find out exactly what e the second power is is that is that interesting to you this def have an e in it but when I add them all up I get e squ you could do e to the first if you wanted to you can find out how much e is based on just this polinomial that's crazy so if you want a good approximation do it to the fifth term add them all up you're going to have a pretty darn good approximation for what e to the second is or E the first or whatever you want to plug in if I want to e to the first I just plug in one e to the seventh just plug in seven and then add them up and you get as accurate as you want to on that approximation show hands that one made sense kind of cool right that's the idea all right let's continue our examples on how to find Taylor and mcloren series now if you remember from last time I gave you some steps on how to do this I want you to read those steps to me what's the first step in finding a tailor or mcloren series what should we do first how many how many derivatives you know what as many as it takes for you to find a pattern if you can find a pattern on the first derivative fine like e to the x that was really easy uh on some of them you can't do that so do three four five however many it takes to actually find the pattern do derivatives what's the step after that very good in our case xal well Cal 1 is that's going to be our C so we're going to be plugging in one and then we find a pattern for that after that set set up series good and after we set up our series we're looking for very good it's going to be a function right we got to find out the domain of our function that is the interval for which are series converion which are power Series converion so step one let's go ahead and let's find some derivatives we always start with the function itself like Ln of X after that well we start taking first derivative second derivative everybody what's the derivative of Ln X please good now I'm going to write that differently because we're going to be looking for a pattern here so when I do 1 /x um you usually I want X to some power not 1/x so I'm going to write this instead as yeah X to the1 power so let's write this as x^ the1 that's going to make our derivatives a little bit easier as we go down the way and it's going to make us find a pattern pretty quickly are you with me yeah okay so we're going to go fast through this stuff hang on to your hats here what's a second derivative please okay I'm going to write -1 x to the -2 is that okay with you yeah and here's why we're going to do that when you're doing this when you're doing your derivatives do not do things like this when you do a third derivative I don't want you to multiply the- 1 * the -2 and get two I want you to look for a pattern yeah a negative * Nega is a positive but really we're going to get 2 * 1 x -3 does that make sense to you are you with me remember you're looking for patterns here you're looking to make a pattern out of this guy not to get the number to get a pattern let's do a fourth derivative and a fifth derivative and then we'll find it so the fourth derivative of x we write a little four up there what's going to happen it's going to be negative very good and it's going to be 3 * 2 * 1 * X4 does that make sense to you do you see what's happening had I put 1 1 2 six you would not have seen a pattern here does that make sense so when you're doing this don't don't do that don't do 1 1 2 6 20 whatever you're you're getting okay so let's do one more the fifth derivative of x we're going to get is it positive or negative so we're going to get positive and then 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * x to the very good do you see your pattern yes tell me something about your pattern right now as far as the sign goes also do you notice something our pattern does not start with our first term this is not part of our pattern this doesn't even work with it it has no exponent at all so we're going to we can start our pattern after the first term so after that this would be like the zero term at the the next term so we don't have to start it here we notice our pattern goes okay positive negative positive negative positive negative positive negative positive negative that's going to be something it's going to be alternated do you guys see the alternate I'm talking about secondly tell me something about my exponent increases decreases by decreases by one that's right so it's negative if you want to see the absolute value increases sure so1 -23 45 tell me how it relates to the derivative that we are taking to the derivative that we're taking 33 44 5 5 the same next one will be sixa six does that make sense yes okay tell me something about the coefficient of my x's what's it doing it's a factorial that's right now is it n factorial is it the power factorial is this oh yeah it's nus one that's right so it's really close but it's still factorial but it's one less than the power we have does that make sense yeah let's check it out if I omit the negatives and positives this is 2 - 1 factorial sure is this 3 - 1 factorial is this 4 - 1 factorial and 5 - 1 factorial and 1 - 1 factorial Z factorial yes yeah 0 factorial is one okay so we could do the nth derivative right now what we know is that it's alternating yeah it's alternating it says it's going to be -1 to some power we just got to make sure it starts correctly for us so we're going to have n or n minus one up here somewhere we'll deal with that in just a second okay next up uh well we're going to have what how do I represent this okay so if I get get rid of all the negatives say I don't even care about those we're going to have an nus1 factorial for sure and then x to the N power does that make sense to you yeah you sure M okay now this part is what I'm worried about how can I represent because right here goes positive positive so let's just let's forget about this one let's look just here so I don't want positive positive negative positive that doesn't really work for us that's not our pattern so our pattern doesn't really start until our first derivative term so omit that how can I make it positive negative positive negative positive negative how can I start that off is it 1 to the N or1 to the nus1 if I start at n = 1 nus that's right and you know what if you're not good at think of man I don't really I don't know well if you can't find a pattern here that's okay what you're really looking for is Step number two plug in the numbers here's F of I'm sorry what are we plugging in even one PL one okay so F of one and fime of one and fpre of one and plug them all in for one it's got to follow the same path pattern so it's got to be alternating it's still going to have a factorial somewhere in there that's why we did this it's a look for the pattern and make sure it's still the same okay so check it out uh F of one is what is it zero zero good because if I plug in one I get zero now we just determined that's not going to be part of our pattern so we're going to be omitting that term how about this one one how about the next one how about the next one if I plug in plug in one you're going to get 2 * 1 plug in one you're going to get 3 * 2 * 1 plug in one you're going to get positive 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 do you guys see that all we're getting here is this this series of numbers that be multiplied together we don't have any more X's because one to any power is still one so basically if you just omit your X's this will get this happens to be0 factorial this happens to be netive 1 factorial this is positive 2 factorial this is negative 3 factorial this is positive 4 factorial you with me still is it still alternating yeah does it still have a factorial yeah in fact this is going to be1 to the N -1 and then n -1 factorial you can see something here as well check this out if you're good enough to find a pattern which some of you are and some of you maybe you're going to struggle with this this is kind of hard to do in in general if you follow the steps I've given you try not to get just the numbers try to find your pattern this becomes a lot easier okay but look at this if I take my my x = 1 like that's my C okay take my xal C which in this case is one and I plug it in do you see that if I plug in one here I get exactly what we found over here hello do you see that it's going to be it's got to be the same so if I plug in one if I plug in one I'm still going to get the same thing if I found my pattern correctly now if that's our n power of F at one then here's what we're looking for what we know is that a tailor series must look like this our tailor Series has to be Nal in this case um listen in this case we're not going to start the zero term are you listening we're not going to start the zero term because if I start the zero term that's this guy and that's not following our pattern so we're going to change to nals 1 you're going to see another reason why in just a minute so we're not going to start at zero we start at one because our pattern doesn't start till our nals 1 does that make sense to you not n equals 0 not the zero derivative not the function itself but at Nal 1 so 1 to Infinity we've got to look like okay the N derivative at remember Taylor series C at C uh what's our C right now okay and then say what C to the x- okay x - c very good x - one two the N over factorial perfect so feel okay with that so far so we found our derivatives we you actually found a pattern to it if you find a pattern if you find the N of F at X then all you need to do all you need to do is plug in your Center if it's zero plug in zero if it's one plug in one and you automatically get the N derivative of F at one if you simply plug in one that's literally what this means now I've given you both these steps because if you can't do this if you can't find the pattern sometimes you'll a find a pattern just from plugging in the number this is really what we're looking for anyway so if you can't find the pattern here use this to plug in your numbers and then find a pattern from these numbers show hands feel okay with with that idea once you do that understand that what we're trying to do here is do a tailor series or a mcloren if we're centered at zero tailor series are always n derivative of F at your your point C at your Center well that would be at one hey we already found that then it's xus your Center x -1 to the N power over n factorial we proved it last time so all we got to do now is what let's make a substitution so our tailor series therefore is going to be n = 1 to Infinity I know I'm going to have an X - 1 n Over N factorial can you please tell me what goes here have I lost you no what goes what goes there then perfect that's exactly right it's literally this thing if the N of f evaluated at one is this which we found in two different ways really then we're going to plug that in so-1 to the N -1 * n -1 factorial okay I really do need to make sure that you're okay with this so far um I don't think I'm going to give you any any sort of recap I've done it a couple times here derivatives find a pattern plug in numbers find a pattern this is what you're looking for the reason why you're looking for this evaluated at this point is because that is what a tailored polinomial is all about it says find your nth derivative evaluated at whatever your C is equal to we have that make your substitution these guys are always the same it's xus your Center xus your c a value at to some power n Over N factorial do you really feel okay getting that far now before you go any further simplify it if you can for instance I've got an n -1 factorial over an N I should be able to simplify that can you simplify n -1 factorial Over N back forth you're left with nus one you're not left with nus one you're left with n n factorial is n * n -1 * N - 2 * all the way down to 3 2 1 are you with me look at this what's that n- factorial so n factorial is bigger than n -1 factorial by one term by multip multiplication by n does that make sense to you so don't jump to don't jump the gun and go n minus one no this is less than that if this would have been n + one then yes n plus1 would be up here but it's not this is n -1 factorial this is n -1 factorial time n therefore this gets simplified with all this and we get 1/ n that's what we get so this goes boom boom n so our tailor series becomes 1 to Infinity of -1 to the nus1 * x -1 N All Over N that's what we really want to work with that's going to be nicer than working with this thing for us for sure are we okay with that one yes you sure okay so we've done derivatives got it step one we've done plug in the num step two we found a pattern we've made our tailor Series this is what we wanted to do this was step number three now step number four are we done with this you got to tell me where this thing converges so what's the next step interval of convergence very good how right side people how are we going to do the interval of convergence what would you use here absolutely the ratio test for sure it's got well it had a factorial uh but it's got a power of n and something that doesn't have a power of n you're not going to want to do a root test here do a ratio test also ratio test gives us a nice interval here if we know that the limit is less than one we have convergence do the ratio test for me right now please oh by the way one more reason why you can't start at n equals 0 here let me have your eyes on the board real fast if you started at n equals 0 what's wrong with this picture you couldn't even do it all right so we start at n equals 1 firstly because the pattern doesn't even start till the first derivative n equals 1 derivative and also for the definition of having a defined uh series here you can't even start at zero okay so continue your ratio test I'm going to do a board here real quick so we're going to do the ratio test but I definitely want you to do it on your own please we should be pretty much pros at doing the ratio test I want to make sure you get the same thing I got so can I have your eyes on the board here real quick how many people did the uh a subn plus1 term here and got this and over a subn term here and got show P you got exactly that cool what's the next step what should you do simp simplify as much as you can what's going to happen to my negative ones they gone so we're going to get a limit and approaches Infinity do we get rid of the absolute value ladies and gentlemen no we really don't do that when we have x's in here we are going to multiply by the reciprocal of our main denominator so here we're going to have our this piece gone still have this piece still have this this piece then we're going to well this piece is gone absolute value takes care of that for us multiply by reciprocal we have n of x -1 to the N what's the next thing that we can do here can we simplify yes we're going to simplify then we're going to collect our n terms and collect the remaining X term everything else should simp simplify here so what do we get get okay I'm going to get N I like that I'm going to get a limit n approaches Infinity of n/ n + 1 absolute I'm going to get an absolute value very good the why why can't I pull out the N Over N plus one and not have an absolute value tell me explain to me why I can do that very good n Over N plus one is always positive we start at one go to Infinity so this is always positive we collect our n terms no absolute value maybe parenthesis if you really want to be technical about that put parentheses around it uh what's going to be inside of our absolute value under one or over one where is the xus one on the numerator very good because this simplifies all of this that little + one that says that you have 1 power of x -1 more than you had here therefore x -1 is still on a numerator absolute Val is a little bit big here so we get our n/ n+1 no problem collect our n terms we simplify we get x - one still an absolute value now what do we do take a limit very good what's the limit of n/ n+ one one very good so this thing is equal to absolute value of x - one now tell me something about the test we use what test do we use what's that tell us about con converg of a series so whatever we have here must be less than one for convergence you with me that gives us our interval that's great so right now we know that this series is going to converge when the absolute value of x- 1 is less than one that's when we know this is going to converge that's when we know that this tailor series will represent our function Ln of X you with me that's what we know CU it only works if the series is going to converge that's the only time we get out put for our function which is the only time we can actually get a function here now from here can you tell me my radius of convergence what is it as soon as you find whatever is being raised to the N power right here as soon as you find that in your absolute value that right there is your radius of convergence so the r is one now let's go ahead and do the interval of convergence from here what we know by the definition of the absolute value in equality is that1 must be less than x -1 must be less than one you follow me on that one that's what a definition of absolute value inquality is now we're looking for the interval so we don't stop here we want to get X by itself so when we get X by itself we have to add one to all three of our zones practically we get zero is less than x is less than two you okay with that so notice it is one in the center of our interval right in the center it's supposed to be there is the radius still one can I add one and sub want to get these two numbers that's why we get our radius here first and then we we get our interval now here's the issue what about 0 and two ends H end points we got to check our end points check your end point actually you know what we'll do it together I want to be a little bit quicker about this let's check our end points any questions on the pattern at all so this was just to find our pattern just basically just to find this piece right there everything else we already know so here we go here's our end points what are end points right now Z so zero if my original tailor series goes from 1 to Infinity of -1 n -1 x -1 n over n and I say I want to plug what what number I'm plugging in Z and where am I substituting that so this becomes the series N = 1 to infinity1 to nus1 time what oh 1 n that's right over n you all okay with where that's coming from if you plug in 0o for X you're going to get 0us oh that's 1 1 the N here we got our first little piece 1 nus 1 we got second little piece when we plug in zero for X we get 1 n now simplify this before you try to do any tests on it the1 nus 1 * 1 the N does not look very good right now so what we're going to do is because we have these common bases being multiplied together what are you supposed to do with your exponents when you have common bases being multiplied together you add them so this becomes series N = 1 to Infinity of what over n I I'll tell you it's going to be negative 1ga 1 to the 2 N - one 2 nus one okay show P should be located with with that one now we're going consider this for a second what does 2N minus one always give you plugin ends what's it always give you odd number gives you odd numbers it's very good so we're starting one right so you plug in one we get 2 - 1 that's one then you plug in two we get 4 - 1 that's three plug in three we get 6 - 1 that's five we get odd numbers that this the expression 2 nus one this gives you odd numbers now how much is -1 to the 2 N - one then what is it always negative it's always negative very good because it's always going to be to the 1st 3rd 5ifth 7th 9th whatever always odd then -1 to the 2 nus 1 you know what guys this is just equal to 1 that's all it is does that make sense to you because it's always going to be1 to an odd number negative 1 to an odd number is always going to give you negative 1 therefore this series becomes how much is this whole piece do you understand why yes if this is always odds this whole piece becomes -1 n you sure you're okay with it now do you remember that we can pull constants out of our series negative sum from 1 to Infinity of 1/ n oh my gosh we finally have it tell me something about the sum from 1 to Infinity of 1 over n what is that Harmon har that's harmonic or it's a p series with P equals 1 either way you say this what happens to this series I don't care about the negative what happens to this series negative Divergence is still Divergence so this thing diverges so harmonic therefore Divergent tell me something about the end point of zero is that going to be included in my interval of convergence no therefore is that going to be in the domain of my function as is represented by my power my tailor series no no it's not going to be my my domain okay the next one next end point we got to check is the two so let's plug in the two if we plug in two this series goes from 1 to Infinity of -1 to the N minus one if I plug in two how much do I get one yeah 2 Min - one gives you 1 to the N All Over N now this one's going to be much more straightforward not going to have any fancy pants math to do up here okay how much is one to the N that's easier I guess this wasn't too hard anyway you got to know that 2 N - one is odd numbers so this becomes -1 to the nus1 All Over N this whole thing is one one to the N is always just one 1 time anything gives you the anything hey tell me about this series what do you know about it alter it's alternating it's alternating harmonic harmonic what what do you know about the alternating harmonic series could you do a different test to show that if you forgot it do alternating series test you got it don't do absolute convergence because this does not converge absolutely if you do ab absolute convergence you get harmonic and that says Divergence says not absolutely convergent it's conditionally convergent by the alternating series test so this is the alternating harmonic series by the alternating series test this thing converges you state all these things you tell me what it is you tell me what you're using to find out convergence or Divergence say harmonic ay Divergent no problem alternating harmonic series I know that's converion already or by alternating series test it converges so here's what we know we know that the function FX = lnx can be represented by the Taylor series and then you show the tailor series you say it's -1 to the nus1 x -1 to the N All Over N factorial you you show me what the tailor series is you say hey look at this this is what we're doing here folks don't lose track of what we're doing don't just miss the forest for the trees and go through this process and don't understand what we're doing what we're saying is this you ready this function is represented by the Taylor Series right here centered around one on the interval and then you tell me what the domain of this function is question do we need the uh nus one factorial sorry it should be n just it's this you want simplified the simplified form so let me make sure I got it right we got N1 n -1 x -1 N All Over N yeah give me this give me the simplified form this is the easiest one okay you're not want to do this if you can do this and get the same numbers so do this so our function can be represented by our tailor series we got it right here but only on the given interval that you just found this the only time that this series will converge therefore it's the only time that this series will represent this function it's on what interval parentheses Z bracket good so parentheses because zero does not included bracket because two is that means you can plug in any number from zero non-inclusive up to two inclusive and what you plug in is going to represent that function if you do the series to Infinity show F if you understand that one okay cool tell you what I'm going to show you a couple other problems uh as many as I can do to get you really good at this because there's some other techniques that you're going to have to learn here in order to be successful at doing your Taylor series and the cor series okay last chance for any questions you have any I want to start fresh do you have any questions on on this one have I explained it well enough for you all to understand it cool so our next example write down F ofx = sin x yes we're going to do trigonometric okay series don't for your pants it's fine and what I want to do right now I want to find the mcor series what's that mean find the Tor series that's right mclen series is a tailor series with C equals to zero not a problem so what we're looking for ultimately is this what we want excuse me what we know is we want a series that has the N der at zero x to the n Over N factorial does that make sense to you hello yes no that's a tailor Series right it just so happens that c would be zero making it a mcloren series that's that's what our goal is is to find that thing now where do we start say what now F the nth derivative of F this is hard to say the nth der of f that's what we want so we start doing derivatives that's step number one so D okay we'll start with our function our function sinx what's our first derivative please what's our second oh come on we I know that more than one of you know this what's our third derivative what's our fourth derivative is there a need to go any further no okay I hope not s cos cos cos cos cosine here's the problem oops what's this what is that cuz I don't know because it depends on where you stop doesn't it it depends on whether you stop on a remainder of when you divide your your derivative by four if you divide it by four and it's zero cool 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 it's going to be a cyclical pattern it's like number Theory okay so yeah you you don't know what that's going to be so this one we can't do it this way sometimes we can't find an N of f explicitly because it's going to depend on what remainder of four that we're in on our cycle well you can even see it clear here number two step number two says okay start plugging in oh I'm sorry what number we supposed to plug in here Z very good our c is zero and the first derivative at zero and the second derivative at zero and so forth and so on let's see if you can give this a try what's uh the function itself self at zero yep what's the first Der at zero and then and then and then so we go this is weird 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 what is the n derivative at zero again I don't know it's one of these three choices it's either Z 1 or Nega 1 but I don't know what it is we're going to have to go a different way around this all right so when you come up this and you can't find a pattern start listing out the terms of your mclen series or your Taylor series start listing them out so we're going to start there so if we really list this out arm mclorin series uh from yeah we'll do over here aror series what's our very first term well this would say that you start zero right you'd have X to 0 that's 1 over 0 factorial that's one uh You' take 0 derivatives that's basically just F of zero remember doing this like the first day we did our MCL and our our Taylor series we started listing out the terms for it you'd start off with f of zero did you follow me Taylor would be uh F of C no problem then we go okay cool uh we add to it the first derivative at zero time x to the 1st all over one factorial that would simply be one we okay with that one then we'd have the second derivative at zero we would have X2 over 2 factorial no problem then we'd have the third derivative at zero we'd have X to 3 all over 3 factorial then we'd have the fourth derivative at 0 x 4th power all over 4 factorial and we would not stop I want to show up hands if you can get from here to here you understand what I'm doing show hands if you do that okay so AR yes no AR mclorin series says when you plug in zero you get no derivatives bam no derivatives at zero x to the 0 is 1 0 factorial is 1 then you plug in 1 so our first Nal Z term Nal 1 term plug in one you get a first derivative no problem x to the 1st all over one factorial plug in now two you get a second derivative you get X the 2 all over 2 factorial now plug in three you get a third derivative x 3 all over 3 factorial you plug in four fourth derivative of 0 x 4th over 4 factorial are you paying attention does it make sense to you let's plug in the numbers what's F of z z what's fime of 0 1 1 * X is X does that make sense watch carefully what's the second derivative at zero this is why we did this so this whole thing becomes zero what's the third derivative what's the fourth derivative zero zero do you guys see what I'm talking are are you with me at all I don't want to lose you here but I want you to I want you to be with me but I got to move too so do you get that the the function at Z zero yes no first derivative at 0 is 1 second der at 0 is z third derivative at 0 is negative 1 fourth derivative at 0 is 0 * anything is zero plus how about the fifth derivative is it going to be zero or one or negative 1 it's going to be one 0 1 0 1 0 1 0a 1 0 1 0a 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 it's like a song having fun right this is it's cool well now let's simplify this a little bit do I really need to include all my zeros now we come to a fine point that maybe it makes a difference maybe it doesn't I like to think that it does okay we're going to come to a fine point this really is the first term second term third term fourth term fifth term we're going to redefine our series here because what's going to happen is if I omit my first and my third my zero withth and my second term and my when n equals three and or two and four I'm going to get x - x Cub over 3 factorial + x 5th over 5 factorial - x 7 over 7 factorial plus blah blah blah blah blah blah blah forever and ever and ever and ever can I need quick show hands if that makes sense to you now if I try to Define this as a series in terms of n my NS are going to compete for instance my n's are stemming from here aren't they are you with me which means that this is going to be my zero 1 second third fourth fifth 6th sth but this I want to consider my first second third four so can I define a series in terms of n yes but understand it's a different n it's a different Series so what I'm going to do right now I'm going to use the letter K so we have no ambiguities of what's going on okay we're going to Define this thing right here as a different series so tell me on this series from K = 1 to Infinity tell me what's going on tell me something about that that you guys see alter it's Alterna okay that's easy let's start with that1 to the is the first term positive or is the first term oh you know what let's start at zero actually start at zero just to keep our our uh MCL Series in mind here start at zero first term positive first term negative so the only way that we're going to do that is if we do oh which one k n minus one would give us zero and that'd be negative 1 K just K just be K because if I do negative 1 to the zero I get posi 1 does that make sense if I do negative 1 to the first I get negative second I get positive third I get this is going to work for us that's where we're getting our alternating from is 1 to the K are you sure you're okay with a okay a okay you get an A because you're not a problem now multiply tell me what our X's are doing what are the powers of X doing odds they're odds hey we just dealt with odds we just dealt with odds well let's see if that works um if I plug in zero wait a minute I'm gonna get Negative I'm gonna is this x to the negative one power how can I change that to make it work that'll work that'll work so if I do zero okay what's 2 * 0 plus one let's do uh plug in one now plug in one so remember zero should give me my very first technical term if I plug in one it should give me this term are you with me plug in two it should give me this term that's why we redefined our K so we don't get ambiguous with that so plug in your plug in one two * 1 is plus one hey plug in let's plug in two 2 * two is four plus one five boom now what's the denominator doing it's exactly the same but with a factorial you better make sure this is accurate before we go any further okay so we start off derivatives are really easy pattern is really easy but there's no way for us to explicitly Define it because we don't know what this is going to be the N der F I don't know it's supposed to be a little n by the way I don't know what that's going to be so we write out the terms mclen series says you know what you have F of 0 frime of 0 * x frime f Prime of 0 x to the 2 over 2 factorial x triple prime of 0 x 3r 3 factorial and so forth and so on except with our pattern that we just found we know we're going to go coefficients wise 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 that's going to basically omit half our terms they're all gone so we just take the terms that actually have something and what that does is that takes a a series with like two n terms and gives us a series with n terms or practically we have a series with n terms and we get a series with n / two terms or K terms where k equal n / 2 well if that's the case let's redefine it so we don't get confused on the the terms themselves we say okay let's let's start k equals to zero and go to one and go to Infinity then we have this is this what's that say what's this part say for your series alter it's alternating so this says we're alternating no problem this says we're taking x to the odd Powers over odd numbers factorial this is our mclen series now what we going to do with our mcloren series say it again ratio test definitely ratio test it's got a factorial in it right we're not done here you see what we've done is we've defined we know that F ofx equal sign can be defined by this mclen series it can be defined by it but we got to have the interval of convergence so do the ratio test notice word K so your limit should go from k k approaching not n but K approaches Infinity so so go forward this one should be quite easy for us the simplification is going to be a little bit crazy but too too [Applause] hard oh my gosh1 to the k + 1 * x to the you know what if we do k + 1 here do you see it's going to be 2 * k + 1 + 1 do you see that 2 * k + 1 + 1 okay and this is going to be same thing 2 k + 1 + 1 factorial sounds like we have a stutter doesn't it plus one plus one no no no1 to the k x 2 k + 1 all over 2 k + 1 back forth no problem but I want to make sure you guys have exact the same thing that I have here show hands if you do have exactly that thing is the ratio test getting pretty easy for you yes it should be right we've done it like 50 million times what's going to happen to my Nega 1 cancel I mean don't matter absolute value takes care of our 1 any power now of course we have a complex fraction we'll write this as a limit don't change your K to an N absolute value don't lose that on our main numerator let's distribute notice this you're going to have 2K + 2 + 1 that's 2K + 3 you guys get that one yeah X to 2 k + 3 all over 2 k + 3 factorial here we're going to get 2 k + 1 factorial and then here x to the 2K + one yall still all right with that one just some algebra we multiply by the reciprocal what should you do now what should we do now simplify as much as you can now be careful with this can you simplify X 2K + 3 and x to the 2K + 1 I want to say yeah I want to say yeah too so if this is X 2K + 1 this is X 2K + 1 + 2 do you see the plus two in that this is x 2 k + 1 + 2 that + 2 is really just an x² do you get that yes then you get the whole thing okay now this one's a little weird we got factorials we've done this only one time before if this is 2K + 1 factorial this is 2K + 3 factorial think about this for a second 2K + 3 factorial means listen carefully I'm not going to write it again I've already done it this means 2K + 3 time 2K + 2 * 2K + 1 * everything below it so what when you simplify this this 's completely gone you with me this one you have the terms until you subtract down to 2K + 1 so you have 2K + 3 no problem you have the term 2K + 2 no problem the next term would be 2K + 1 would not yes that's going to simplify term by term with this one so our limit therefore becomes the limit as k approaches Infinity what do we got 1 2 K do we need an absolute value here no you actually don't you have an X squ don't you or positive these are all going to be positive just make sure you put them in the right place we're going to have a one over what's going to be on our denominator 2 2 time X2 see where X squ is coming from 2K + 3 2K + 1 now let's do this some there tell me how much is this limit always going to be equal to as K approaches Infinity always for any X remember you tell me the X first right you say x is blank I say okay pick a k that goes to infinity and now we take one divided Infinity that's Z 0 times any number that you've already told me is zero and this is oh wait uh why is the zero important tell me in relationship with the r test why that's important lesson one says that it converges right now does it matter the X for which we plug in to get our zero no we're going to get zero no matter what x we plug in so this thing equals zero for all X that means Z is less than one for all X can you tell me my radius of convergence convergence is infinity what's my Center does it really matter if we going to Infinity no not really but the center is zero what's my interval of convergence so here's what we say and you write this out FX = sin x can be represented by the series N = 1 sorry zero my bad 0 to Infinity of I'm going to use this series okay but I'm going to change it back to NS just so we're we're our format okay -1 to the N it was a dummy it's a dummy variable it's a dummy K it doesn't really matter what we use dummy plus 2 n + 1 factorial on the interval negative Infinity to Infinity as we just just showed hang on for one second I know I'm going to go a couple minutes over here but I want to show you one more thing it's quite interesting uh quick show of hands if feel okay with this so far now this is pretty pretty freaking rad okay which means if you want to find out sign of I don't care what you want to plug in s of three sign of pot sign pot or two I don't care what you want to plug in all you got to do is plug it in here this is remember this is the series right this is where we got this is the same thing this is the same exact thing so you want to you want to find s of 3 S of -2 sign of 1. 1846 I don't care plug it in here and here and here and here and here and figured out for the first however many terms you want to and you can be as accurate as you want that's what the power series will do now the last thing very very fast this is interesting remember me telling you something about how we can take take derivatives and integrals of power series remember doing that we did it in the in the very end of our last section well if FX = cosine X and cine X is the Der of sin x and sin x is x - x 3 3 factorial plus X 5th 5 factorial - x 7th 7 factorial plus blah blah blah blah check it out do you agree that sin x can be represented by this on any interval we just proved it just showed it then if I take a derivative of sign take a take a derivative of all this crap what I get hey what's the derivative of sign I'm sorry what's the derivative sign so if sign's represented by this stuff if I take a derivative of sign and I take a derivative of this stuff the derivative of s is cosine cosine can be represented by the derivative of this stuff which means one minus x 2 over 2 factorial look at what happened bring down the three the three is going to cross out with this three and give me 2 factorial plus x 4 over 4 factorial - x 6 over 6 factorial plus do you see what happens it just lowers everything by one power and one factorial specifically we get a mcloren series of it's still alternating it's still alternating it's still X to a power but it's only even Powers you don't get the plus one over 2N factorial do you guys get that so we didn't have to do any work for it we took a derivative of sign derivative sign's cosine no problem take a derivative of term by term basically look at this this is really this is really cool um check this out could you have done it right from here take a derivative this goes here cross out with 2 n + 1 you get 2 N subtract one from my exponent we get this last little bit what's the interval do you remember me telling you that when you take derivatives and integrals your interval of convergence does not change only the end points since we don't have any end points our interval is exactly the same so cine X can be represented by this thing on that interval sure if F feel okay with with that one okay okay so getting to our last example on how to do a tailor or mclorin series from scratch from scratch means that we invent our own series after this what we're going to be doing is using known Taylor mclen series to fit our function to it you see that's a lot easier and so a lot of times we can manipulate what we have into what we've already made does that make sense to you so the last thing we're actually going to make um and what it is it's it's a polom 1 + X2 some power K where K is a real number so K could be like 1/2 K could be negative K could be positive like two or three in which we would get like a binomial expansion that's actually what we're going to get anyway so I'll I'll show that to you right now so once we start do you remember the first step when we start any tailor or M series what do we do good so we're going to find a series of derivatives here we always start with the function itself F ofx and we find our first derivative first derivative is going to be well if you notice this it's going to be the chain rule over and over and over and over again so practically we bring down the K we get 1 + x the chain rule gives us one and then we get K very good that's right and we keep on going the second derivative would give us K * K -1 * 1 + x to the K - 2 are you hanging on with me here okay the third derivative would give us K and then it would give us K minus one and then would give us K - 2 and then it would be 1 + x and then it would be K - 3 you still okay yeah we're just doing a general power rule or a chain rule whatever you want to call that we'll do one more a fourth derivative would be tell me very good now we want to make the jump how about the nth derivative of f the nth derivative let's look at this for a second think about what's going on what's going on is that I'm multiplying but it's not Qui K factorial what's happening is I'm doing I'm doing k then I'm doing K minus one I'm doing K - 2 I'm doing Kus 3 but I don't get to the K minus n do you see it I get to the K - n + 1 the K minus one more before that n does that make sense to you okay also I'm doing my K well this is to the K minus n so let's check it out first derivative minus one second derivative - 2 third dtive - 3 fourth derivative -4 nth derivative K minus let's let's wrap it up first dtive K -1 second Dera k 2 third dtive K - 3 fourth dtive K - 4 n k minus perfect that's exactly right now all the stuff I got to rewrite this I'm going need more room so n derivative 1 + x to the you just said it K minus n and are you guys all right with that one yeah now here we'd have K we'd have Kus one we'd have all the way down to K minus what's this number in relation to my n like nus one it is n minus one that's right but check this out we'd have K minus nus1 do you guys see what I'm talking about here this would be k - oh N - 1 K - oh 3 - 1 oh uh K - 2 - 1 K where it go k minus 1 - one just K so if I had Kus nus1 the N minus one's got to be in parentheses do you understand what I'm talking about yeah well if I am to distribute this and make it a little nicer this is K minus n + one Kus n plus one let's see if it works we got our K sure we got our K let's see how this works is this K - 2 + 1 yeah - 2 would be well -2 then plus one gives us Min - one here would be 3 3 - 2 plus one got it and then we'd have -4 + one that's three I think I said that one backwards said Min - three and then plus one that's - two -4 + one that's three - n + 1 and that's where we would stop should feel okay with with that so far now we actually have a pattern for our nth derivative of f which means if I want to find what I what I want here to do here is find the Corin Series so if I want to find them the chlorin series what I want is that n derivative of F at zero the mclen series says it's centered at zero you with me on this one well let's do that what number am I going to plug in and where am I going to plug it in Z so that's what it says right here so if I plug in Z for X what's uh what's 1 plus 0 one one one to any power one one so this whole thing is going to become one essentially I'm just going to get this piece back again do you see it yeah so K and then K K -1 and then all the way down to K - n + 1 okay showan you located with that so far guys over here yes no y all right so if we're looking for the mclen series here's what we're saying we're saying the mclen series should represent a function f ofx in this in this case 1 + x to the K by doing this it should be a series which starts at zero and ends at Infinity it should be the N derivative at zero it should be over n factorial * x to the N if that's a MLL series does that look familiar to you yeah that's our mcloren series all right cool well hey you know what this part is going to be there no matter what it's centered at zero yeah that's why we have mcloren Series this says over n factorial not a problem this one do we know our expression for the nth derivative of F at Z in fact we just found it it's right there so now we say okay this series is n = 0 to Infinity we've got oh my gosh k k -1 K - 2 all the way down to K - n + 1 all over n factorial * X to n goodness gracious me that's a lot of stuff okay what I want to know is by show hands you feel okay getting that far do you do you see where where it's coming from do you see where where all our derivatives are coming from yes no why we stop at n minus sorry K - n +1 you see where that's coming from all right well if we plug in zero for X which is our center it's the cor series says C C equals 0 no problem just plug that in so at zero we get this thing's gone we get just this piece by definition in the chorin series is the n derivative of F at zero hey that's right here times x to the N okay that's right here all over n factorial so we have the N der of F at Z we got x to the N we got n factorial hopefully it's clear for you it's just a mcloren series you guys with me on it now let's do do the first few terms of this to see what it really looks like because many you probably going how in the world am I going to do that series what in the world does that look like here's what it looks like this series looks like this so really you could represent 1 + x to the K by doing these terms the first term is going to be one the first term is going to be one because remember what the mclen series represents are you listening mclen series represents f of0 first F of 0 says I just plug in Z I would get one 1 + 0 is 1 to any power gives you one that would be my first term then I would get the first derivative at zero the first derivative at zero would give me K but then I'd have my X for my power series I KX all over one factorial because I'd be at my first term are you guys all right with that so far so this practically speaking just represents these guys right here then we multiply by X to whatever our n is and divide by n factorial so here we go okay uh at zero term I'd get F of0 that's 1 * x to the 0th power that's one / 0 factorial that's one so we get one the next term says okay cool well we get K * X to 1st over 1 factorial that's KX then we would get K * K -1 * X to 2 all over 2 factorial are you starting to see the pattern at work now yes no you sure okay then we keep going we get K we get K minus one what's the next term actually factors would would be and then what x to thir all over perfect that's what this thing looks like you go okay cool it starts at one because the mcor series says you start at the function evaluated at your Center are you listening you start at your function evaluated your Center in a mcloren series that Center is zero so you start at F of zero that would be one to I don't care what it is one to any power is one we start at one and multiplied by x to the zeroth over Z factorial that would be one over one that's giving you one then you do the first derivative evaluated at your Center the first derivative evaluate your Center is 1 * K so it's K time x to the 1st all over 1 factorial that just gives you K * X does that make sense then you do your second derivative evaluate at your Center x = 0 okay well that's 1 * K okay so we have K * K -1 hey time x 2 over 2 factorial that's where these things are coming from that's where they're coming from the next one would be K * K -1 * K - 2 * K - 3 x to 4 over 4 factorial and You' continue forever does that make sense to you what this is called is the binomial series binomial two terms being expanded so this is the binomial series and we can make this series look a little bit different uh what this actually gives you here these things give you the binomial coefficients do you know what the binomial coefficients are have you ever heard of Pascal's triangle have you took me from calculus one you have heard of that Pascal's triangle goes 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 1 4 6 4 1 have you ever seen that before yes that's what these numbers are one and then well whatever whatever K you'd have it would depend on that but that's what the binomial coefficients are so this thing this gives you this one k this gives you the binomial coefficients for whatever K you actually have isn't that kind of interesting it's going to give you a line of Pascal's triangle what does Pascal's triangle always start with one one and then it depends it's gonna either do well one two and then one three one oh look at that whatever your power would be that's weird that's kind of cool so if you have a power of the fifth I'd be down here 1 five it'd be 1 5 10 10 5 1 that's interesting so this would be 1 five this would give me 10 this would give me 10 five and then one that would be my binomial coefficients so the way that we write that actually since these only represent your binomial coefficients we can write it this way this series is represented by K N this stands for binomial coefficients like that so what I want you guys to know about this thing is that this idea this whole thing from here to here they all they give you are the terms of Pascal's triangle those are the binomial coefficients this is represented by that just to make it look nicer so if you ever seen that before that's what that is quick head not if you're okay with with this so far would you like an example to see how this actually works in practicality okay before we do this I want to give you a couple notes here's your notes if K do you have this written down because I'm going to erace this for some room so these are binomial coefficients these are binomial coefficients these are binomial coefficients that's it if K is a positive integer if give me an example of a positive integer please four good what else one and any posi number 100 not any positive number no 1.3 is not a positive integer integers of positive whole number very good a positive whole number is a well whole numbers are inherently positive so a positive integer are whole numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 not zero does that make sense to you so if K is one of those if K is a positive integer then this series will converge for all values of x okay so let me let me put this in uh in other words for you okay let's say that your function was 1 + x to the 3r is that a POS is three a positive integer then this series is going to represent this function function for any x that you put in any X does that make sense to you if if this was uh if the K was now4 is this series going to represent that for any x no but it will represent for a different set of numbers okay so here's here's the other choice I guess if K is not a positive integer if K is not a positive integer this series will converge but it's only only going to converge if x is between 1 and 1 oops more specifically if K is between1 and 0 we get to include the end point posi 1 if k is greater than or equal to zero we get to include both end points if not we don't include any end points and that would be by the ratio test so let me go through it one time as far as all this conversion stuff goes you ready I'll give you an example in just a minute we'll go through it pretty quickly but we'll give you an example here so binomial series no problem those are binomial coefficients what this series will do this series will converge and represent this function if K is a positive integer anywhere anywhere 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 if K is sorry if K is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 forever no problem then this series will converge for any value of x that you want to put in there did do you grasp that your interval of convergence is infinity Infinity not a problem it will always converge now if K is not a positive integer that would be 1/2 -4 -3 whatever it happens to be this series will converge it will represent your function but only on the interval of1 to 1 xal 1 to1 those values of X will make the series converge if K is not a positive integ have I explained that well enough for you now there's more specifics to it if k happens to be between - 1 and 0 you get to include the end point of this interval one if K happens to be between well not between sorry positive so greater than or equal to zero then you include both of those end points that's the idea here show fans feel okay with that one now let's do an example here real quick [Music] um does this fit our binomial series that we want I think so does this look like this something to the K power yeah how what's our K okay good now can we represent this with a with a Taylor series or mclen Series yeah yes we can and tell me something will the series that we get converge they all converge where will they converge for all X or between 1 and 1 and okay now let's think carefully we're so we're not here right no K is not a positive integer K is positive is K between 1 and 0 no is K between 1 and 0 no is K bigger than zero we're here okay if we weren't here and K was like negative let's say k was -2 we'd be here let's say that K was -2 be here does that make sense to you okay so here's the deal we can represent 1 + x to the 12 Power by listing out these terms these binomial terms so what we' do is we'd say all right let's just follow this for right now so we're going to start with what good one we always start with one that was the easy one okay let's continue what's the next term what's our K so we would have 12 X Plus what's our K again so we have 12 * 12 - 1 * x^2 all over so 12 * 12 - 1 * x^2 all 2 factorial then we have what one half very good keep going could you do the next terms if I asked you to yes very good now ultimately what we're going to get down to is we're going to get this we're going to get down to 12 12 - 1 12 - to 12us n + 1 remember that term k - n + 1 okay and we would have x to the N All Over N factorial that's where we would end now we're going to simplify this a lot a lot a lot so we got to look at what these things are actually doing these fractions what we're going to do is we're going to take these fractions simplify them and look how that affects our problem are you with me you sure you're with me okay let's think about 12 times whatever this happens to be what's this going to give you okay remember what we do with patterns what we do with patterns is we don't really multiply things I know it's 14 but what I want you to see is that this is really -1/ 2 * 2 two do you see it 2^ s this one would be 12 * 12 time 3 am I right or what it be positive or negative positive and you would get three over 2 are you with me yes okay let's put this together then so what this becomes we'd start with one we'd have 12x but then the next one check this out this is where the pattern actually starts so positive POS what's the next term going to become we're going to have X2 all over 2 factorial * 2 squar this right here is -1 over2 2 if I take this this goes on my denominator this negative changes that to a minus I have an x squ on my numerator I have a two factorial on my denominator and I have a 2^ squ on my denominator the algebra can be a little tricky if you're not super good at algebra do you see what I'm talking about here yeah are you sure have I lost you I don't want to lose you okay let's go to the next term come on stick with me here folks uh do I have a plus or a minus plus it's going to be a plus because it's positive I'm going to have an X to the3 on my numerator do you see why now this was 3 over 2 Cub so what I get is where would the three be the three would be on the numerator where would the two cubed be 3 factorial * 2 3 does that make sense to you okay now the next one let's see about the next one do you suppose the next one's going to be positive or negative okay on the on the numerator do you understand I'm going to have an x to the 4th yes yes do you understand that I'm going to have a four factorial somewhere yeah yeah do you understand I'm going to get a 2 to the 4th yeah now these numbers are interesting this goes one three see where the one's coming from five three five actually it's 1 time three isn't it this is 1 * 3 * 5 the next one would be plus 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 x 5th over 5 factorial 2 5th and that's the pattern we're looking for the last term the last term as we end this it's going to be there's actually no really good way to write this pattern it's 1 * 3 * 5 you got to write that out and then go okay well where's it ending it's ending at 2nus one it's ending at an odd number 2 nus one I'm sorry 2 nus 3 because Theus one would give us two much bigger one bigger - 2 X to the n all over let's see if it matches this is our n matches our factorial n factorial 2 to the N now because this pattern starts at the second term we're going to Define it this way so we know we can represent this function 1 + X2 by doing this you guys see what I mean about the pattern starts at the second term this pattern doesn't really start right here this is positive positive and then we go negative the pattern starts here so you can define a series like this or a function like this Define it like okay well we got 1 + 12x plus and then we're going to start with our series the series does this it's starts at the if this is the zeroth term and this is the first term our n would be starting at the two to Infinity we got to start with look at this do you I see that I have the same one I the same one2 and then I have a minus I got to start with a negative term so what we're going to do is say I want this negative one to start by being negative how can I do itus one I can do n minus one um we we we're going to use n + one just so we don't have any problems with it uh we can do n minus I think n one will work as well so n plus1 did you see that's going to be the same exact thing netive positive okay cool after that well we have man the pattern starts the pattern does this omit these first two terms that's what this does says hey put the first two terms then start your Series this is like where we start our Series start your series with a negative then make it a positive then a negative then a positive that's what this is doing starting with a negative then doing positive then negative then positive are you with me still so far yeah the numerator of your series does this the numerator goes one 13 135 1357 13579 blah blah blah blah multiplying by all the previous odd numbers it's not a factorial because you're not multiplying every single number you're multiply only the odd numbers the only way we represent that is by showing it then we do 1 * 3 * 5 and then you say you're going to stop at well what we want to stop at is let's see this would be it compared to compared to This n this would be 2 * 5 minus what to get this 2 * 5 because we want to Bas on N right and it's got to be odd so it's 2 * something - one or- 3 - 5 well to get this number it's 2 * 5 which is 10 3 not one it's not stopping at 9 it's stopping at seven one odd number before that so we're going to stop at 2 nus 3 that's our numerator our denominator is only n factorial no problem 2 the N got it and then we have x to the n and that's about the nastiest freaking thing that you've probably ever seen yeah yeah crazy do we have to check for convergence yes no no no cuz we already did it I already proved it to you in the very first example we did today so what we say is that so F ofx can be represented that's what this means F ofx can be represented by this series on the interval what's our interval to one including both why why including both it'ser good yeah X is the K the K is greater than zero um it's not betweena 1 and zero also this would be all real numbers if K had been what exactly right so we'd say this we'd say that our function can be represented by this really nasty series we know it's going to be convergent because we already proved y we already showed that if K is positive integer for all real numbers X if if K is between uh1 and 0 then it's for x = -1 to 1 but only including the end point one if it's outside of that range if it's less than one less than negative 1 then it's only for negative 1 to one not including any end points for us we say hey look at that our K is not a positive integer but is positive if our K is not a positive integer but is positive we include both of our end points it goes from 1 to one that was a crazy example show hands if you hung with me you're okay on it it's a little weird right is it going to take some maybe thinking about later maybe maybe watch this part again now what we're going to do from here on out I'm going to show you how to make your given function fit a series we've already done I'm going to list out some series most of them we've done already the last two well there's two or three of them that we haven't are there any questions no thank goodness okay that's great okay I need you to write this quickly we've already done they are in your notes I'm just recapping here so here's some common mclen series that's smaller I think I all but these three we've worked with so what I'm going to do for you is I'm going to give you what these series look like I'm going to give you the the actual series notation for it um and I'll show you how to work with them because they're they're it's going to be really nice I promise you're going to like this better than what we just did well that that's not saying much uh anyway so here we go what this series is do you remember doing that it's one of the first ones we did we took an integral of this it became Ln of 1 - x and then we divided and we got this uh we got well that would represent the Ln but this series is represented by 1 + x + X2 because what it really is is simply a geometric series remember that a was 1 R was X bam this is our geometric series and it was simply represented by this and the interval of convergence was -1 to 1 edx was a nice one it was 1 + x + x^2 over 2 factorial + x 3r over 3 factorial plus and that's the series from n = 0 to Infinity of X the N Over N factorial and that converged for all real numbers sign we actually did do you guys remember doing sign remember doing some of these ones we worked through them this is all of our examples we made them from scratch sign was this it was x - x 3r over 3 factorial + x 5th 5 factorial minus and that created the series for us from n = 0 to Infinity -1 it was alternating obviously x to the odd 2 n + 1 over 2N +1 factorial and it converged for all real numbers X does that one look familiar to you yeah we did it yesterday we did oh perfect so it looks familiar uh cosine cosine was really easy cosine was just the derivative of sign 1 - x 2 over 2 factorial plus X 4th over 4 factorial minus blah blah blah blah we said hey it's still Al alternating it's now x to the even numbers over even numbers factorial and it converged from negative Infinity to Infinity oh that's last thing we did that's right okay Ln of 1 plus X Ln of 1 plus X we have x - x^2 / 2 + x x 3r 3 - x 4 4 I don't remember if we done this one or not this is the series from n = 0 to Infinity -1 to nus1 X over N All Over N and you can see that right here it's kind of a nice one this converged on ne1 to 1 positive 1 was included one is not included you know I'm probably move the last two over there um just to be clearer sin inverse of X we would have X we would have no we have not done this one okay I'm just giving this to you um so you have it we actually do X Cub over 2 * 3 we would do 1 * 3 x 5 over 2 * 4 * 5 and what this ends up being is a series which is quite interesting we start at zero we go to Infinity we have 2 to the N factorial X 2N + 1 all over 2 n n factorial squared times odd numbers these ones I got to tan inverse of X is this x - x Cub over 3 plus x x 5th over 5us X 7th over 7 or in other words that's an easy one looks nice at least we get alternating we get x to the odds over odds do you see how similar tangent inverse is to S inverse it's really similar except that's a factorial really similar though it's interesting and tan inverse only converges on 1 to one inclusive so does s inverse okay last one we just did it if you have 1 + x k this thing is equal to the series we just showed it Nal 0 to Infinity I'm not going to go through it again uh binomial coefficients time x the n and it converges on1 to 1 conver 1 to one if K is and there's special cases okay if K is positive integer it's all real numbers if K is between zero and uh1 then we get U one included if we get above zero then we get both end points included so there's special cases there now here's the point the point let me make sure I got all these right too I don't want to I definitely don't want to give you the wrong stuff here I pretty quickly I think you forgot coine no I didn't forget it just that looks good perfect got it that one's so nasty that's good Perfect all right now here's the whole point the point that I'm going to make here is that you can manipulate functions that you're given to fit these forms and if you can do that then you can you don't have to reinvent the wheel basically you don't have to start from scratch on these problems have you written this down cuz I'm going to erase it here real quick because I need to start here do you have it yeah this one you already have so just worry about about that one can I eras it yes no okay good for example let's say I give you this function on your test which I'm going to do and I say I want you to find the Taylor series at this point so I want Taylor at x = 2 or C = 2 we go for it now here's how to diagnose the problem if you're going to have a tailor polinomial oh not sorry I'm skipping ahead you're going to have a tailor series at at the point xal 2 or Cal 2 what that means is that somewhere in your series you are going to have x- 2 does that make sense to you no I can tell by the blank looks in your faces that you're like what if you're going to have xal 2 or C = 2 whatever I want to say there then you're going to have x - 2 somewhere in your tailor series do you remember your tailor series says x - c yes you're going to have x - 2 here if your C is equal to two so F be okay with with that one okay here's what you need to do whatever your Center is if you have xus 2 X plus whatever uh sorry c 2 or c equal whatever get x minus that number in your given function you must make this up here somewhere so what that is what that means is that I've got to manipulate this such that I find this in here are you listening I'll show you if you if you don't what in the world you talking about I'll show you okay you got to manipulate this to get my x - 2 so here we go from 1X 1 over 1 + x well i' think about it 1 over 1 + I would do uh x - 2 but then I have to undo it + 2 can you follow that one I'll do it one more time I have this I need this so I if I centered at two I'm going to have to have x- 2 somewhere in my I have to have that so my 1 /x plus whatever I'm going to say all right cool well 1 + x no I need an xus 2 that's what I need does that make sense to you I can't just arbitrarily subtract two from my problem though if I subtract two I'm going to have to add it back it still has to equal this thing does this still equal that yes sure it does now let's simplify 1 3 + x - 2 quick show of hands you feel okay with that so far do you see that we have the same function it's just we've made this piece in it a it's going to be a tailor series it has to have xus 2 up there somewhere that's our Center got to find your Center okay you got to be centered here now take this and actually look at this one what does this most closely match out of all of these does it match s inverse no no it doesn't does it match e to x no does it match 1 over 1 - x that's the closest that's what we're going to try to fit it so we need to make this thing fit this thing now when I say fit this thing we need to make it fit 1 over 1us I'm going to put X here in quotations x x stands for some quantity it can be a really nasty looking thing but it stands for X like whatever's there and then whatever's there we're going to take it and put it here and here and here and here and here we're going to get that thing out of it let me show you so if I need to make this fit 1 over 1 - x I need to manipulate this so that this thing becomes a one can I do that how do I do that if I factor out a 1/3 if I factor out of 1/3 I would get 1/3 * 1 over 1 + x 2 sorry x - 2 over 3 can you do the algebra on that to make sure that that's okay with you yeah distribute the three here's three here's x - 2 do you guys follow yeah now this is very close this is one over one plus something some bunch of crap okay I want 1 over one minus I got to change it to a minus it's got to fit this so I'll have my 1/3 I'll have my 1/ 1us but then this how can I make that how can I make a plus equal a minus something you can't dox + 2 explain me why you can't dox + 2 boom you have to have that does that make sense so you got to have that as your Center that's got to be there it's okay it's basic algebra it really is basic algebra but you feel okay with it is this thing still this thing yeah just nasty looking now here's the cool part this is okay this is where the rubber hits the road all right this is this is what's awesome what this really is is it's yeah it's 1/3 but inside here do you see it's 1 over 1 minus X it's just our X our junk is this junk that's our junk are you sure you're okay with it do I need a 10-second recap to go go over it or are you you sure you're okay yes some of you don't look okay make this here because that's our Center X if it's two you got to have xus 2 put that up there yeah you got to add two to it simplify it make it fit one of these things in order to do that we need 1 over 1us junk X is your junk okay if I need 1 over 1 minus junk right now I don't have it make this a oneide three got it make that a minus split off a negative now I got it now it's one over one minus junk cool cool take this thing fit it to this stuff and then see what happens so if we see what happens here we're going to fit it to this this formula what's our formula start with yep the next thing we'd have in our formula is what notice how X is the junk this is the junk you sure you okay with that yes so 1 plus we'd have x - 2 over three so far so good are you sure you're okay I I want don't want to leave you behind here because this is very important for us to know we have one we got one we got jump here's junk put your junk next thing we do junk Square yeah junk Square what's what's in between there okay plus I don't like to say the whole thing so yeah junk Square minus 2 over 3 whole thing S Plus let's do the next one and then we'll stop what's the next one plus junk Cub plus blah blah blah blah blah we're going to go forever and ever and ever okay I need to show up hands if you think that you can make it from here to there show fans if you can do that it's not that bad right you should put the whatever your X is this is the important part this is the hard part making it fit after you make it fit just put this in here it's 1 1 - x it's 1 over 1 - x put it here and here and here and here and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and then see what happens with your series now there's one thing that we're forgetting what are we forgetting the 1/3 is multiplied by all the stuff don't worry about that right now forgotten about that don't worry about that right now wrong on the test yeah don't do that we're going to use one of these later so okay let's keep on going let's take this let's simplify it so if I take that remember oh man remember we are looking for patterns here we're looking for patterns so what I'm not going to do I'm not going to go 9 and 27 what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep the I'm going to keep the 1/3 I'm going to do a one I'm going to do a minus so notice how that's a minus we got x - 2 over three what's the next thing we're going to have a plus or a minus we're going to have x - 2^ 2 over 3^ 2 yes no we're going to have a minus x - 2 3r over 3 3r then it's going to be a plus and then so forth and so on um can you make it down that far with me yeah you see where we're getting the x - 2 to the 1st and to the second to the third yeah yeah we get to the 1 and to the second to the thir we're doing positive oh sorry negative and then positive and then negative and then positive and we have three to the first and second and third and fourth now we're looking for a pattern here so check it out let's fit this to our pattern this is 3 to the what power no this is 3 to the first this is 3 to the aha that's going to give us our one so we start with one x - 2 the 1st x - 2 the second and third we got 3 to 0 1 2 3 can and we go ahead and make a series out of this in series notation sure here's how you do it the 1/3 start starts up front and you multiply make this your series our Series starts at n equals good zero it goes to Infinity tell me something about this series that we know Alterna alter alternating and starts with a positive so we're going to have neg1 to the N cuz that's going to start positive the next one would be negative the next one would be positive does that make sense to you yeah we're going to have x - 2 to the very good all over 3 to the N perfect that's exactly you guys are getting it yeah this is 3 to the N hey 0 1 2 3 here's x - 2 the n 1 2 3 here's starting positive and going alternating no problem there's one more thing we got to do it's very easy take the 1/3 and move it inside so if you have 1/3 * this do you understand this is 3 to the 1st yep if you have 3 to the 1 * 3 to the N you get 3 to the n + 1 now wrap it all up FX = 1 1 + x can be represented by this on the interval oh wait a minute for got all about the interval didn't we do we have to check the interval no no it's already been done for you which is why we use these things no ratio test no endpoint test no nothing look at look at the board which series did we use what's the interval of convergence same thing here pretty cool right you can make them fit this is one of the harder ones that you're going to do um now we're almost done with it almost I I kind of lied a little bit this would work this would work if your X was just X but keep in mind don't stick with me here for just a second okay this would work if your X was just X but your x that you used here is your junk okay so we have one more thing to do remember that your X your X Works between -1 and 1 do you follow yeah okay just put your junk into where this junk is so what's your junk negative okay Sox - 2 over 3 that's your jump multiply by three oh wait a minute what's negative due to inequalities F add your two flip it back around we get the interval 5 take your function make your Center fit after you make your Center fit manipulate so it fits one of your series you already know after that use it your X whatever your your X is up here is whatever your junk is here whatever you made it fit as okay so this right here this becomes your X just don't forget that at the very end when you get all this stuff done when you find your pattern when you make your pattern work it's not going to be that hard when you make your pattern work take your junk put it back into your interval and then solve for it solve for what that interval is does that make sense to you yeah okay now I'm going to pause the tape here real quick uh if you need to go you may go I'm going to stay here for another 30 minutes or so and lecture uh I'm going to put this on video tape so if you want to just do this later you can um but so if you want to if you need to go go I don't want to make you any later than you are for whatever you want so I'm going to give you about 30 seconds if you want to head out head out you're not going to offend me okay if you want to stay I'm going to be lecturing I think you're going to enjoy it if you do stay but if not have a great spring break okay 30 seconds go or stay this doesn't look like something I can afford to miss you can watch it it's going to be the same it's not the same it's not the same it's not oh I don't want to do this to you guys if you really need to go oh no it's fine okay all right so now we're going to continue that's all you're saying did this make sense to you did you grasp that you go okay take your junk plug it in no problem just don't forget about your interval your interval yeah it's going to be based on this but this says that your X your stuff is going to be between 1 and one solve for your actual X and you get here between 1 and 5 now we're going to continue we have um we have about two two and a half more examples they're going to go quicker now that we have this idea uh so what I'm going to do is I'm going to put up the example we're going to talk about what series we're going to base it on I'm going to show you the things that we can do and we'll end so next [Applause] example what I want to do with this I want to find an theoren series you'll notice that in the previous example we based it on a mclen series didn't we because I gave you common mclen series if you need a tailor series you have to fit the xus the center in there not a problem if you want a mcloren series it's even easier so if I have x^2 sin of 2x well what series are we going to base that on sin x so what we know is that uh if sin x is is equal to x - XB 3 factorial + x 5 5 factorial minus blah blah blah blah if that's the case look at what we can do it's so nice all we got to do all we got to do well is this exactly like this is this exactly like this no exactly like this no this say sin x this say sin 2x don't fret don't worry if sin x equals this then sin 2X equals plug it in 2x - 2x 3r over 3 factorial + 2x 5th over 5 factorial minus and you keep going like that notice how here uh I keep using the word junk I'm going to still your your X your junk is now 2x so you just plugged it in now fortunately for us because we have a mclorin series you don't have to fit in xus anything it be zero it would just be X does that make sense to you go cool all right well your junk is 2x just put it in here we got 2x we' have 2X Cub we'd have 2X to 5th should feel right with with that one all right now oh man is this the same as that no no but it's really close so if that's not the same uh what what else could we do say what now how do I make this look like this m you can actually do that right now if you want I'm going to show you how to do it later uh it's it's really easy so I I prefer doing it this way but you could multiply by X2 everywhere you could do that it's going to come out exactly the same it's just the patterns a little harder to find so we're going to start finding this pattern right now so uh working on the pattern let's see what it actually does what this is is this be 2x no problem this would be remember I'm looking for patterns here so I'm going to have 2 to the 5th no I'm not I'm have 2 3r X 3r over 3 factorial I'm going to have 2 to 5th x 5 over 5 factorial I'm splitting this up for a reason the reason why I'm splitting them up is because I'm going to be multiplying by X2 later and so I'm going to have to M split them up at some point or another I'm going to split them up right now show fans if that makes sense to you now let's make our series we're about good to go on this so our Series starts at zero it goes to Infinity uh tell me something about this series that you know Alterna yeah it's alternating and it starts off with a positive so that would be n that's right tell me something about else about this series OD numbers it's odd numbers that's right it's taking two two odd numbers it's taking X to odd numbers all over odd numbers factorial we have to use a plus one here for odd numbers because we're starting at zero do you guys see what I'm talking about if we start at zero and we get a one and a one this says well at your zeroth term you're actually getting one so 2 * 0 + 1 gives us 1 2 * 0 + 1 gives us 1 all over 1 factorial so we're starting it says zero but we have to make them odds but we got to start at one so it's not minus one this time it's plus one you see y that L you you're does that make sense okay so here's what we know we know that this thing s of 2x would equal that series with no problems now how do I get from s of 2x to what I want you can do things like that so if I multiply by X2 and I multiply by X2 listen it's an equation okay it's going to work this thing rep is represented by this series therefore X2 * this thing is represented by this series times x^2 therefore x^2 * sin of 2x is equal to our series we go from 0 to infinity1 1 the n 2 2 n + 1 what's that going to be 2 2 + 3 2 N yeah do you guys remember that you're adding exponent so 2 n + 1 + 2 that's 2 n + 3 now I'm going to stop for just just a brief moment do you understand that um you could have multiplied by X2 here and got the same thing it's just your twos would be different than your X's so your powers of two x's is this going to change to 2 N Plus three now we're almost done with this one too this they're going to go quicker after this uh look back at your notes and tell me the interval of convergence for our sign not sign inverse for our sign they infin to Infinity what that means is that it our s is convergent on Nega Infinity to Infinity our s of 2x is also convergent on negative Infinity to infinity and even when I multiply by x^ s it's still convergent on negative Infinity to Infinity so what we say we wrap this thing up and we would say that uh FX = x^2 sin of 2x can be represented by our nasty series on negative Infinity to infinity and if you forgot what that means here's what it means it means this if I want to find out this as evaluated any number I could actually do it with a series I could plug in my give me a number any number three three plug in three if I wanted to plug in three I could actually represent it by plugging in three to this series working all out to infinity and adding all up together and it will work for any value what it says is that this series will converge for any value of x therefore for any value of x this series this power series Taylor series mclen series will represent our given function show F if that one made sense to you so can you man manipulate what you have to get what you what you need sure multiply this by two you get this take find your pattern find your series multiply by x² no problem just a couple more the reason why you don't have a whole bunch of other uh mcloren series why you only have a a set amount of them for me is because a lot of times you can manipulate what you're given to what you want to get remember CCH the definition for CCH no we don't uh it's a do you remember what it means hyper that's what the H is very at least we understand that okay so uh well if you don't remember it here's what this meant this meant e to x - e to X all over 2 do you remember that one yes okay cool well if you split this up then what we really have here is a combination of two different series which is really cool so think about this um look back at your notes and you tell me what e to the x equals as far as your series is X N you know what that's great but we're going to have to do it term by term because we're going to have to find this pattern because we're going to be combining two series okay so tell me term by term what e to X is represented as 1 plus say it again keep going plus X over 2 factorial and Patrick's right that would be X the N Over N factorial quick head now if you're okay with with that so far awesome now if we can fit these things to this thing this thing to this thing and then subtract them when we just fine so check this out this is kind of interesting so if I do oh wait a wait a minute one e xus e thex well if I have one look at that do you see that e to X is just going to be this bunch of junk so this is going to be 12 * 1 + x + x^2 2 factorial + x 3 3 factorial plus blah blah blah BL blah minus 12 * here's our 1 12 here's our e tox you tell me does this fit exactly what this is what's our junk here so negative X is what I'm plugging in so if I plug Inga X then I'm going to get one I'm going to get please look carefully if I'm plugging INX I'm going to get- X do you see what I'm going to get plus X2 2 factorial do you see why I'm getting plus because if I'm pluging a Negative X I go okay One onega X cool what's x^2 postive x okay what's my next One X to 3 is still X it's X 3r over 3 factorial plus blah blah blah blah are you sure you're okay with this now something really really cool is going to happen when we do this check this out ignore the 1 halfs for a second because naturally if I'm subtracting something multipli by 1/2 I can subtract the terms themselves and multiply by 1/2 later did you catch that so watch what's one minus one those are gone do you see it y now this would be x - x so that does not simplify CU that's going to be X Plus X that would give us 2x but what's junk this yeah junk X2 2 factorial minus x 2 factorial do you see that every even power is gone every even power so the squared squared the fourth with the fourth let's combine what's left over in fact if I just factor out my 1/2 we're doing some Advanced outs we're here all kind of in our head if I just factor out the 1/2 what I'm going to end up getting is well here's and here's remember minus and negative is a plus we'd get 2 x Cub over 3 factorial Plus 2 x 5th over 5 factorial plus blah blah blah blah blah blah blah did you catch that we we did some Advanced algebra here we're Distributing our negative and we're combining our like terms basically we're factoring under 1/2 no problem our negative would distribute and then we're combine like terms if you get that your ones are gone your two power twos are gone your power zeros are gone power twos are gone power fours are gone power every even power is gone your odd Powers will be added together x + x 2 X X3 X3 2x3 X5 2 that's 2x5 now when I distribute my 1/2 what happens with this one and that one and that one and so on and so forth so this becomes x + x 3r over 3 factorial + x 5th over 5 factorial which makes a series oh let's do this together where does it start starts at zero goes to Infinity tell me about my powers of X what do I have odd Powers remember if I'm starting at zero is this odd power going to be 2 N minus one or 2 n + one plus one because I have to start the one so yeah you're right x 2 n + 1 all over tell what I get on my denominators beautiful that's exactly right so FX equal cin X can be represented by this on now look back uh what what mlin series did we use to do our work with e x so look at the interval of convergence for e x therefore if we used a a m series which has a convergence of negative Infinity to Infinity then this series also has convergence of negative Infinity to Infinity so when we get something that's not explic listed we don't want to make this thing up on our own okay we don't want to start doing derivatives of this it's crazy we don't want to do that we want to base on something we know already the definition is this well that's 1/2 e x oh look at that this is exactly what this is this is just this stuff with a Negative X plugged in everywhere we get here we get here multiply by 1/2 no problem factor out the 1/2 distribute your negative lots of stuff simplifies out and we got a very simple series to work with where we already know the conversion so when I say represented that means that this series will give us this function for any number X you plug in and that's kind of cool we have one more thing to do and then we're going to be done okay this is the last thing this is uh this is going to blow some of your minds right now okay this is what I really wanted to get to today uh because it's so interesting and so cool I want to lead you down this road here and I want to consider this here's my question do the interal that wasn't a question was it do the can you do it yes how do you do it do the interal do the interal can you do the integral is a UB going to work no heck no it's not a definite integral so I'm not going from anywhere to anywhere can I do the integral itself oh yeah here's how firstly well you know that uh e to the X we actually just work with it 1 + x + x^2 2 factorial + x 3 3 factorial plus blah blah blah blah right hey can you make this thing look like that thing what's your junk here so plug in your junk if you plug in your junk I still have one then I have 2 no not - 2x^2 it's going to be a minus it's just going to be X2 are you looking at this here's our X right take this that is now your X does that make sense to you this is your junk plus we'd have x^2 2ar over 2 factorial plus x^2 Cub over 3 factorial plus blah blah blah blah blah well that's 1 - x^2 + x 4 / 2 factorial - x 6 over 3 factorial plus what would the next one be come on go for it are you with me on that one y are you sure you're with me let's write this as a series our series would be 0 to Infinity tell me something about our series what would we get say what definitely alternating and starting positive so1 to the end we'd have x to the tell me something about our X's what's going on all evens that would be 2 N no pluses no minuses just 2 N when we plugg in zero would get out one we plugged in one we get out two all over what that's right in factorial that's brilliant exactly right show hands feel okay with this so far you're sure you're okay on getting from here actually from doing the X to Thea x s you see where that's coming from we're just taking X squ and plugging in every single place we got it now this is so cool if we want to do the integral if we want to do the integral well let's just since we know that we about go since we know that this equals this since we know that this equal you believe that right and it converges for all real numbers since this converion is all real numbers this is for all real numbers well if this equals this and I want to find the integral do you remember anything about calculus you can integrate on both sides of an equation well then all I need to do is integrate this side and integrate this side integrate this side and integrate this side what that means is that if I do my integral I could do it from here actually I'd have x - XB over 3 plus X 5th [Music] over 2 factorial * 5 well you know what there's an easy way to do it I showed you this before if I integrate this one what's going to happen to my power remember doing the the calculus on these things so this is a series negative 1 is still going to alternate I'm going to have x to the 2 and what do you do with integrals do you add or you subtract I'm still going to have an N factorial but I'm now going to divide by my 2 n + 1 you can't put them together there're still an N factorial but now you're just dividing by that new power that's exactly would you what you would get if you did this ter term by term term by term would give you x - x Cub over 3 + x 5th over 5 * 2 factorial - x 7th over 7 * 3 factorial it would give you alternating still odd X do you see the odd X's odd powers of x 1 3 5 7 no problem it's giv you over odd numbers 1 3 5 7 times your n factorial 0 1 2 3 factorial so you can do integrals of functions that you could not do any other way besides this is that not interesting to you isn't that kind of cool we've done an integral of this thing that integral will be represented by this series if I want to find the integral of whatever I whatever I want it's going to be on the series from Infinity to Infinity because integrating series do not change the interval of convergence we talked about that before do we need a plus c for that or no yes yeah I don't even know if I put it on my notes but plus plus c means you're completed that's right did that one make sense to you are there any questions on this before we end so so you got you got that you got this from here to here right you got that if this thing equals this I can integrate both sides and if I integrate both sides well if I have a series I can integrate the series if I don't have the series I can integrate term by term and it's going to come up with exactly the same series that's really cool Michael are we going to have to do that in this class yeah have fun we just did

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 10.2:  Introduction to Parametric Equations
all right we start a Brave New World so we're we're done with our series inter sequences now we're we're going to Omit one section of here and start with a good stuff the good stuff that we're going to talk about for the rest of our our section and for well kind of most of the rest of this chapter is parametric equations the calculus of parametric equations polar coordinates and then the calculus of polar coordinates after that we'll only have one more section on numerical integration that's our our course in calculus 2 so we are on very much the downhill slope um so start something new in plain curves and parametric equations because sometimes it's really hard or impossible to define a function or a curve as a function and so we have a different way to do that so I'm going like I just said I'm going to be writing a lot I'm going to write a lot of notes on the board because this is probably brand new to all of you unless unless you had the class before so um first thing first thing I had to do is Define what a plane curve is uh PL not the thing that goes and curves around it's not the type of plane curve we're talking about okay talking about a a curve on an actual plane so not a three-dimensional curve a two-dimensional curve just somewhere on a flat surface does that make sense to you a three-dimensional curve would be like a curve in three space uh that would be in your next semester calculus so here what a plain curve means it's just the motion of an object on a plane that's really all it is so when you see this word planker what's that mean well what this is is simply the motion of an object in a plane now I'm going to list out for you I'm actually going to write these out so you have some good notes Here there's a problem with always defining a plain curve in terms of X and Y rectangular coordinates so there's a few problems with this so problems with defining a plain curve so the motion of an object in a plane that's what we're talking about here like a normal function and what I mean by that is like a function in terms of X and Y that's typically what we do right we look at a curve and we say okay uh this curve it's on XY coordinate system it's on a plane and for any plane we should be able to go okay here's your y here's your X we should be able able to define the motion of that curve with x's and y's correct it's at this point then it's at this point and if it's on a plane it should always be on the x y coordinate system so why is there some problems on defining a PL plane curve like a normal function with x's and y's well we're still going to have x's and y's but the way we describe them sometimes we have a problem because those curves they're not always functions so one problem we run into with plane curves is that many times so here's the problems of defining a plane curve like a normal function problem number one a lot of times they're not functions many times they are not functions well if something's not a function it's really hard to describe it as a function you can't say the function of Y in terms of X because it's not a function that's an issue there's a couple other problems second one a lot of times these curves even if they are functions or if they're not functions they can't be explicitly defined in one in terms of one variable like a think of a circle is a circle a function no and the equation for a circle is x^2 + y^2 = R2 isn't it can you describe that in terms of one variable well you can you can take a square root with a plus or minus but you can't explicitly do that and still have a function uh you can describe it and it will make that circle with the plus and minus but it's really hard to do that's awkward some of them you can't do at all so that one you can Define explicitly it won't make a function though so don't go into that misconception some of them you can't even do it so the second problem we run into is well firstly some of them aren't functions a lot of them aren't functions nextly even if they are or if they're not a lot of them cannot be explicitly defined in one variable so many we cannot explicitly Define in terms of a single variable and there's another problem you see with a plain curve if a plain curve is more than just a curve of points if a plain curve defines where an object is does it make sense to you a plane curve is the motion of an object in a plane it's more than just a set of points a plane curve has a connotation that um this little bug this little bug starts here or this whatever starts here and this bug travels so this bug has a starting point it has an ending point so imagine like a fly on the board the fly goes and then I hit it but if I miss it it's going to walk a little bit right CU I don't like flies I really hate mosquitoes so if you see me just I'm not going crazy it's it's a mosquito um so this bug lands on the board the board is a plane this bug goes is this bug going to make a function for us probably not because it doesn't necessarily respect mathematics this darn bug uh it might not make a function for us could you describe the motion of this curve with x's and y's yes you say here here here but if you try to do it with only a normal function it' be really hard to do firstly it's not a function secondly if it's just a listing of all the points it's not giving you when this bug was at a certain point it's also not giving you the direction that it traveled so if I just list out this do you know without me telling you do you know where the bug started do you know the direction that it traveled do you know where was at any given time no that's another problem here so firstly they're not functions secondly a lot of times you can't explicitly Define them as one variable and they don't tell where the object is at a given time I'm going to use time Loosely here uh given point if you want to say given whatever uh we use the word time because parametric equations I'm going to say this in a little bit are kind of thought of in terms of time we'll talk about that and lastly I just mentioned this if you're talking about an object it's traveling it's very useful to know where it started sure when it was at a given point where it ended and the dire dire that it's taking well if I just give you a line does it give you a direction well that's a problem in fact a lot of times when we do our curves even if they're functions we do this we go wait what do mean it's going both directions how can that happen where does it start where does it stop I don't know it's just a series of points this has the indication that just goes forever well it doesn't tell you where it starts doesn't tell you where it stops does it so that's that's an issue if we're if we're mapping where an object is going we need that we need where it's starting where it's stopping and how it's traveling so this one gives us no Direction so no direction is given for that reason we create what are called parametric equations parametric equations are the way that you deal with plain curves so this is not really two different concepts um this is the way that we are going to tackle this does that make sense to you so the way that we are going to go about mapping these plane curves is with parametric equations so let's talk about it and I'll give you um give you the idea behind parametric equations have I explained everything well enough for you do you see the problems I was trying to to show you here they're pretty I mean they're pretty common sense if you understand the what a object is doing when it's moving you want to know where it starts where it lands in the hoard you want to know where it ends you want to know when or where it is at any given time and you want to know the direction that travel so that's why we're going to do these param equations so parametric equations here's what a parametric equation does it says you know what if you're if you're in a plane you can be described by x's and Y's for sure you can you can say at this point you're X and Y that's how planes work that's why we have a rectangular coordinate system to map any point on a plane no problem it's just the way we Define it changes a little bit we say okay if we want to describe where X is and where Y is we can actually do it differently than describing y as a function of X or X as a function of Y what we do instead we say tell you what instead of having X as a function of Y and Y as a function of X we're going to have X and Y as a function of a different variable an independent variable time or t so that's where we get this parameter the t is called the parameter we say okay tell you what you can actually describe X as a function and Y as a function of some other variable it's still going to give you a an X and A Y depending on what you plug in for your your time but in this way we we get away from this well if they're not functions of of each other no problem you can Define X as a function of time and Y as a function of time just say hey at any given time you'll have an X and a y coordinate does that make sense to you so if I said at 1 second you could plug in one and one it's going to give you an X and Y that's going to tell you where that point is and when that point was there does that make sense to you it will in a little bit I I promise it will so we Define the motion of both the sorry Motion in both the X and the Y directions of some variable T so I'm going write that out so we get a good note so we're going to Define Motion in both X and Y directions as a function of some variable t and really it's an independent variable so X and Y become dependent variables upon this T over a common domain and we call that domain I now here's the words we're going to be using okay you want me go through it one more time like a 10c recap yeah okay so here we go our problems with plain curves problems are real fast a lot of times they ain't functions all the time a plain curve if you define it as X and y's it will not tell you where it starts won't tell you where it stops will not give you Direction okay doie and a lot of times you can't expressly or explicitly Define it in one terms of one variable that makes it difficult for us so we we we get around that by saying tell you what yeah every point is still going to have an X and Y obviously it's going to be on a plane it's going to have an X and Y let's just describe them different let's say that well um X is now described by a function of time function of T whatever T happens to be and Y is described by a function of T the same variable but maybe a different way to describe them so it says hey um maybe the function of of t for X say in one case at 1 second you go over three and at 1 second you go up five would it give you a point I'm going to say that again maybe at one at tals 1 the x is three and the Y is five would it give you a point yeah give you the point 3 five it would still describe for you where that point is but if you do it in terms of T it doesn't have to be a function t just goes from wherever you want to start to wherever you want to stop and gives you points that's all it's doing here it's giving you points they can go above each other they go around they can make circles they can do all sorts of stuff does that make sense you're going to see that in a little bit it'll also give you a direction if we start at tals 1 and end at tals 5 where we start at tals 1 the X Y know just going to give you both an X and Y that is your initial Point your starting point where you end at I say 1 to 5 or something when you end at tals 5 that is your terminal point where you're actually stopping the C goes from 1 to 5 you can actually follow that curve and at any T at any time you can plug it uh that t in and find out exactly where that object is and that's a better way of describing the plane curve because it gives us our start it gives us our stop and it gives us our Direction that's the idea so hands if it's making a little bit more sense I promise it will after we do an actual example here okay that t that that independent variable that we're basing both our X motion and our y motion on that's called your parameter hence we get a parametric equation so T is the parameter and I is simply the interval for your parameter or the parameter interval now a couple of the notes before we get into our example typically I've already kind of ruin the suspense for you typically T is thought of as time now don't let this time I it's an just an idea okay don't let this time idea make you think that you can't have a negative T can be negative it's it's not like you can't go back in time it'd be kind of like uh the rocket launch would be at zero there's a time you say T minus 10 D I would love that part because you spend that whatever okay I'm a door anyway we're going to think of it like that time can be negative time can be positive it's just um it just gives you the the idea that this object is moving through a sequence of points of time points so T is usually thought of as time T is typically thought of as time and again I'm going to use that word time kind of loosely here so let's imagine something so for some interval so for some interval I equals A to B here's what this means for you uh what's T called again everybody what's T called time time but in more generally it's called the it's called the parameter that's right I is the interval for your parameter so here's what it says look at the board here real quick time t t is going to start where T is going to end where so we are going to have an initial point and we're going to have a terminal point where it starts initiates its motion and where it ends or terminates its motion does that make sense to you so for any any given closed interval we're going to have an object starting from an initial point starts from initial point and I'm leave some space here I'm going to write something over here and then ends at an a terminal point I do that initial point I'm need the space here initial point to ter Point let's talk about the initial Point um now we just talked about it I hope hopefully you guys hung on to it uh tell me where when is the in it's kind of weird to say when but when's the initial Point going to start uh at A or B so when t equal a we are going to get when tal a we're going to get our initial Point are youall understanding that idea so tals a is where we start our motion now here's what I was trying to explain earlier look at the board here real fast if T equals a check it out X is a function of t y is a function of T so all you need to do figure out where this point starts plug in whatever your T is if a happens to be like three plug in three for both X and Y you get your x coordinate and your y coordinate does that make sense so our initial point would be at uh which comes first X or Y remember our points are always X Y so if we plugged in a I would get F of a and I would get G of a that right there would be my initial Point notice how F of a is our x coordinate G of a is our y coordinate that would give us a point hey could you plot X comma y on an X Y AIS of course you could so a parametric equation kind of goes about it in not a more complicated way but just a different way it says tell you what instead of saying Plug In X's you get y's it says plug in T's you get both x's and y's make sense that way you don't have to have a function now your terminal point where's your motion going to stop at tals so if you wanted to find out your terminal point well what would you have to do to where T's to T's in F good so F of B and F of G of B would give you X and Y respectively once you understand it it's not that hard of a concept it says you can find points X and Y by plugging in a number into a function t a function of t for x and a function of t for y it'll still give you points now what happens is that we talked about this too if we start at a certain point and we end at a certain point this will have some sort of an orientation this trajectory the object will travel along a a definite path it's not going to travel back and forth like this it's not going to be randomly as a a whole bunch of um distinct unique points it's going to be it starts here it then moves to this point then this point then this point along a continuous path until it reaches its end point does that make sense to you so for us right here we say that this starts from an initial point to a terminal point along some sort of a trajectory with a given orientation trajectory has this idea of Direction okay are you ready for an example we've had about 20 minutes of pure theory behind this with no actual example I hope I've explained it well enough I think at this point you should have a good idea about what I'm talking about you should have an idea that what this is going to be is basically you're plugging in a t value for your X and your y independently of each other and it's going to give you coordinates X Y which you can graph on a XY system what trajectory with sorry with specific orientation with specific orientation and that's another point in that our curves are going to have a direction to them so can we start with an example just to give you an idea about what we're we're going to do okay I want to get through at least like four examples because they get very interesting and I want to make sure that you all understand this before you go today so first one let's suppose that xal t^2 - 4 and Y = 2 T and we have -1 is less than or equal to T is less than or equal to 2 let's see if you guys understood anything about this uh firstly can you determine that that is a parametric equation yes no what tells you is parametric is X defined as function of Y is y defined as function of X are X and Y both defined as a function that they have a variable in common like T that's a parametric equation does not have to be t uh in the next couple example well after the next couple examples we're going to use Theta it can be something else besides time okay but it can it has to be the same variable for both these things that makes it parametric with each other it's independent variable of T make sense so far tell me what the parameter interval is please that's all it says notice how it's not saying that X goes from somewhere to somewhere it's not really a domain for X we can find the domain for x by plugging in t that's easy we can find the range of Y by plugging in t that's easy too but really our our domain idea is more like an interval it's an interval that time goes for for it says in our case if T is time T starts at 1 it goes to two and then it stops this this uh fly was on the board this bug was on the board for -1 to 2 seconds or minutes or hours or whatever it was and it traveled a certain curve quick head now if you're okay with that idea now I'm going to do this in two ways the first way I'm going to do this is show you that you can actually find out your curve by simply plotting points it's really easy after that I'm going to show you that we can make functions sometimes or we can at least make Expressions uh that we can graph into ently so I'm going to show you both ways so if you wanted to graph this you know where's our T start again so we probably want to plug in negative one to figure out where this thing starts so we're going to make up a t table no pun intended whatever okay we're going to plug in some T values now here's what we're going to get what we do when we plug in t values where are we going to plug them in yeah for both of them and if we plug them in for X and Y we're going to get points out of this we plug in one number here and here it gives us one point together does that make sense you obviously hopefully obviously wouldn't want to plug in a t value here and a different T value here and then get the same point because that would have different times you'd say hey at time equals ne1 we're here for x and at time equals 3 we're here for y I'm going to put them together no no no it's got to have the same time so we're going to be getting x y points x coordinates and Y coordinates now just because of the first one I'm going to use several points let's use uh well we probably want to know what negative 1 is let's use - one2 let's use 0 let's use 1 12 let's use one and then let's use two so in each case we need to be getting points out of this not individual numbers because T goes into two different functions so let's go through it uh help me out with a couple of these please if you do uh plug in1 we're going to plug in for both X and Y plug in 1 for t to get our x coordinate how much are you going to get yeah hopefully you got -3 did you get3 that's our x coordinate says hey you know what plug in 1 you're going to get our x coordinate plug in1 you're going to get that's our y coordinate so hands if you understand how the points work if you get that you get parametric equation basically as as far as the points go the T gives you the points the coordinates for your points independently it gives you the x coordinate gives you the y coordinate it's still a point though so here's what this says where does our motion start what point does our motion our curve our our object start its motion what that's right could you graph that on a graph okay uh when when does our object start its motion at T one that's that's the idea so let's continue uh have you has anyone plugged in negative one2 okay tell you what how about uh these two rows you start here that row far row do this one this row do this one you guys do this one you guys do this one and all of you work together and do this one very fast have you guys done this one yet what is it you guys get a tough one I know this row what's this one three what's this one okay how about this one we'll go this one you better get this one real fast Geniuses all of you these are the hard ones they're going to be really similar but these are the hard ones uh did you find this one 174s and four or uh one I don't think so actually have it written down it's going to cheat it's 154s I believe yes it is and -1 and5 4 and pos1 is what those points are can I get a double check on that just to make sure that that's what I got okay good I just want to make sure you know how to find them you know how to find them the math yeah you're supposed to know how to plug numbers in on your own okay now can we graph it yes so basically we're just plugging in t for for T time for here and here we're getting our X and Y coordinates let's grab it now let me ask you a question let's see if you really do get it look up here at the board here with me real fast um am I going to want to plot 1 one2 Z2 on the on any axis do we even have a t axis no no don't worry about the T the T was just to find your X and Y you're graphing in terms of X and Y because that is our plane it's our planer system that we're using here so we're really just plotting these points that's all we're doing so Nega we're going to need neg3 then 1 23 I don't think we go pass yeah okay good4 and we're going to have to go up well at least four probably four we almost okay let's plot our points this should be easy for us -3 -2 is here -5 how much is 154s yeah it's almost like -3 and 34s exactly 3 and 34 so it's right here and then -1 is is right there we have -4 0 we know how to plot that we're just plotting points same thing but at positive 1 okay we got that then we have -3 pos2 and then we end at 04 end at 04 quick head not if you're okay with this so far do you see the curve it's making connect the dots don't do little lines okay connect the dots with a nice smooth curve do we need to go past this this way no this is where it starts if our interval if a parameter interval is starting at tal1 then that's our starting point label it what's that called again your initial point so this is our initial point do we have a terminal point not toilet paper okay terminal point you also need to label your direction so there's a if we have a an initial Point here and we have a terminal point here is the object moving upwards or is the object moving down we'll say this up and down is this moving upwards or moving downwards moving up the curve so you show that you show that with an arrow so this curve or this object is moving this way a simple arrow quick show hands feel okay with this so far are you sure so one way we can Define motion of plain curves notice is this a function no no it's a function in terms of x uh sorry in terms of Y but it's x equals something in terms of Y but it's it's not a function in terms of X you can't say this is y equals something X so it's easier to for us to Define this this way sometimes or sometimes it's it's nicer to do that it gives us orientation Direction starting point ending point now I'm going to give you another idea so or this is what we're going to be working with with most of the the rest we don't want to have to always plug in numbers to find points that's kind of the basis right when you learn about graphing you plug in points or you plug in numbers to find your points and you graph those points you make a curve there's almost always a better way to do this so let's look at a different way let's start from here if x = t ^2 - 4 and Y Y = 2 T maybe we do some like mathematical razzled Dazzle and uh and combine these things let me show you what I'm talking about could you solve this for T yes ah if you can solve it for T more specifically t = y 2 you with me m could you do a substitution yes in this way sometimes sometimes time not all the time but sometimes we can get an expression that's explicitly in terms of another variable sometimes in this case we can almost all the time at least for us about all the time we can at least make another function out of it does that make sense to you we can at least manipulate it somehow I'm going to show you that in the next few examples so in our case hey if x = t^2 - 4 and t = y over two then what we're going to have is y over 2^ 2 minus 4 or x = y^2 4 - 4 okay I want show can't be okay with the the algebra on it's basic algebra but check it out do you guys see that this is a parabola opening to the right that shifted along the xais -4 and has a wider than normal parab because it's 1/4 there that's exactly what this thing is in fact you could graph this and it's going to be exactly this here's the problem though if I didn't tell you this if I just had this it would go forever right you'd have to assume T would start at netive infinity and go to Infinity it's still going to have a Direction so a lot of times we can make an expression in terms of X and Y like we did here this is an X and Y but you still have to find the initial point you still have to find the terminal point you still have to find the direction so if you were to do this and I didn't graph the points so if you say okay let's go right to here here's what you do you'd graph your graph it would go forever does that make sense yes from there what you would do you would just plug in your initial point you just plug in your terminal point what's going to happen it's going to be swh on this curve it has to be so you plug in tal1 well you find out your you do it from here you don't do it from here this is just to give you your curve so you do this and find your curve you with me are you with me you plug in your negative one and it's going to give you your XY coordinate it will be somewhere on your curve you erase the rest of it that from where it starts or where where it doesn't start you put your terminal point you erase the rest of it everything between those two points your initial and your terminal that's the object in motion and then if you know where you start you know where you stop you immediately put your direction and that's what we're looking for do you guys feel okay about this example it's a little simple but I want to make sure that you guys understand the concept show fans if you do feel right with it okay we're going to nail a couple of them here real fast um I will be going very quickly through the algebra in these so with me so let's suppose we have x = t and y = t uh firstly is that a parametric equation have I given you an interval no okay if I do not give you an interval you must use What's called the natural domain you probably have seen that before so for instance are there any restrictions on the the interval for T here plug in anything are there any restrictions for the interval on T here what can't you plug in then right there you say okay tell what T must be greater than or equal to zero we get that from here does that make sense so you use the idea of like a natural domain now you say well if I don't give you an interval find your interval if there's no restrictions it goes from negative Infinity to Infinity quick head now if you're with that one all right so uh maybe write a little note down I'm not going to write this but if no interval is given find the natural domain for your uh parameter okay now if I haven't given you an interval it's probably not a great idea to just start plugging in some random points probably not a great idea you do know where it starts it starts at well when T equals z that's cool we can find out the initial Point real easy but sometimes it's nice to have a curve to go off of so for us we say all right well man if you look at these two things if x = theun of t and t = y x = the < TK of Y does that make sense to you in fact to make this even right now we we actually have the graph if you want to think about it in terms of xal square y it's really easy to graph but you can even make this nicer for some of you you well okay Square both sides y = x^2 wait a minut you can do that yeah you can do that as long as you follow the rules for your parameter so if we were to graph this do you know what y = x^2 looks like I freaking hope that you know what that looks like okay this looks like this yes however however does this represent our parametric equation right now no no for for a few reasons firstly half this graph it doesn't even exist secondly we don't have our initial point or a terminal point and thirdly we don't have our Direction so that's what you start on right now so start using your your interval that you found to find the domain for your X or your y or whatever you have to to list out where this thing starts and stops and goes from from so if T equals 0 use that if T equals 0 and goes positive look at this if T equals z and goes positive what's happening to your X can X possibly be negative if x can't be negative this stuff doesn't exist does that make sense to you now use your initial point that you have here where where's the first place that t starts if tal 0 then xal 0 and Y oh look at that xal 0 yal 0 what's the point where we start is that on our curve that we graph that's why we graph our curve first so right here we have our initial point okay tell me something where does the T end no does it end no no so we don't have a terminal point but we do have an initial point if we start here all this stuff is gone this doesn't exist it says that our bug our object lands right here at the origin and then it travels which way is it traveling is it traveling from Infinity here or traveling from zero to Infinity it is so we're going to show our direction is going that way this is the idea so from T is greater than Z this implies that X has to be greater than or equal to Z we get our parametric interval well you can even write it where's the parametric interval start where's where's T start where's TN you can even show that so our initial Point starts at 0 0 we go to Infinity we don't end uh does that one make sense to you yeah are you sure it yes okay let me show you why it's important for you to determine where it starts where it stops and the direction I'll I'll show you right now this going to be kind of cool so so bear with me did you all understand that problem yes so we can find our curve but that doesn't help us we have to actually use our T our parameter to find out our initial point and our Direction and what parts of this curve aren't to find last example okay here we go real fast first thing uh is it a parametric equation yes no yes of course it is X and Y are both defined in some other parameter T can you make a curve out of this by combining these two equations so x = t and Y = t^2 then y = wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute that's completely different than that but I get the same thing is that going to be the same curve is it going to be the same motion is the object going to take the same path is it going to be the same curve so let's think this is weird right so what this says is that can you graph y x^2 then do it of course you can yal X2 now here's the interesting part about this this is where the rubber hits a road as far as parametric equations you got to use that parameter determine where where it starts where it stops and and its motion so check it in the previous example we knew that t could not be negative correct if T can't be negative starts at zero that's our initial point and we can't go this way we can only go that way are there any restrictions for the natural domain of T no no then what's our parametric interval okay yeah you're absolutely right so our time starts at negative Infinity it ends at positive Infinity am I going to have to erase any part of this curve no no because I can plug in now here's what you do to find out where it starts just take your negative Infinity it's weird to think about it but take your negative infinity and plug it in so if I plug in negative Infinity for my T how much is my X yep so T = Infinity implies that x = infinity and yals okay if I plug in negative infinity x is negative Infinity do you guys get that yes if I plug in negative Infinity here Y is what positive does that cope well with our graph can we start at x = infinity and Y = postive Infinity that's actually exactly where this graph starts where it would end if you plugged in positive Infinity for t x would be positive Infinity y would be oh positive Infinity it says it starts at negative Infinity for x and posi Infinity for y and it ends at posi Infinity for X POS infity for y so what direction is it going is it going this way or this way both it's not going both ways it's going it has a start spot okay it starts remember this our interval is One Direction the interval starts here it ends here so if it starts at negative Infinity for T it starts at x = infinity y = postive Infinity it's starting way up here it's going in this direction it really technically doesn't end but the terminal point would be somewhere up there it does not come back it goes from this way to this way that's the way our T flows our time flows that direction so time tells us we have that direction I want know if I've explained this one enough for you guys to understand it so far have I yes okay very good the next example we're going to use something for use some trigonometry uh can you please brush up on a few of your basic basic identities such as the Pythagorean identity for S and cosine uh the double angle formula is like s of 2 2x = 2 sinx Co next Rush up on a few of those before your next session because we're going to use those right off the bat we're going to go through a few of them all right we got our final three examples on parametric equations how to graph them in the next section we're going to learn the calculus Behind These parametric equations so just three more I'm going to go through them like I said pretty quickly here I want to show you some of the things you that you can do in order to find the graph of these so one thing what we're trying to do is get the picture of the graph first and then find out where the object starts where the object stops and how it what direction it's going on the picture of our graph does that make sense to you we don't want to always have to start plugging in points because if I'm not giving you the range of your interval it's going to be really hard to figure out where this thing starts and what the picture looks like without plotting a whole bunch of points not sure if you understand what I'm talking about we want the curve of our object before we find out how it's moving on the object or on the curve so in order to do something like that sometimes we might have to to use some of our trigonometry some identities uh to get a picture of what this graph looks like in our case firstly is that a parametric equation do we have an X do we have a y and do we have both of them defined in terms of another variable right now A is not your variable a is going to be some sort of a constant the only thing I want you to know is that the constant is the same for both of these equations do you see what I'm talking about so what we get is going to be in terms of of a as a constant we're going to get the same shape no matter what a is it's just going to be bigger or smaller I'm going to show you that in a minute it's going to make perfect sense okay what is the parameter then is it X is it Y is it Theta what's the parameter Theta in this case is the parameter it acts like our T so in our case Theta is the parameter now sometimes it's really hard to solve explicitly for your parameter for instance let me have your eyes on the board here real quick can I solve that for Theta easily yes how no okay I can divide by a that's okay if I divide by a I'm going to get cosine Theta = x a you remember what we did in the last few examples if you don't you're going to have to go check your notes or check the video or something what we did was we solved for the parameter and and did a substitution you remember doing that that's what we did basically every single time is that going to be easy to do here if I solve for Theta only thing I could get is cosine inverse of x a right is that something I want to substitute into this probably not because I'm going to S of cosine inverse of X that's nasty okay so sometimes that's not the best way to go about it but the idea of get as close as you can hand to solving for your parameter such as cosine Theta and sin Theta equal y a that's something we could do quick head out if you're kid with the algebra on that one so if you can't explicitly solve for your parameter like we don't want to here okay you don't want to do cosine inverse and you definitely don't want to do sin inverse and try substituting that's not a good idea but but if you do have like a trigonometric function like these ones are you have cosine right you have S isolate those pieces maybe Nota itself maybe not the parameter itself but isolate these pieces the trig function cosine Theta sin Theta and then use an identity for instance one identity that's comes to my mind right now that's really nice that relates s and cosine very nicely is this one do you remember that identity that's like the one you remember right what's that one called well check out why this might be nice if we can solve for sin Theta and cosine Theta then can we substitute these pieces into these pieces MH yeah in fact you know what uh I'm G to have I'm going to reverse this it's going to be the same thing but just because you'll see it a little bit nicer I'm going to write this as cosine S Plus sin s is that the same for you okay let's do the substitution one's not going to change tell me everybody what is cosine Theta what I'm sorry say that one more time x a so if I have cosine thet = x a cosine 2 thet is X a plus what's sin 2 yeah exactly right if I Square both those things we get x2 over a 2 + y^2 A2 oh my gosh you know what some of you might know what the picture of this graph looks like from right here but you're definitely going to in the next step let's get rid of that a squ what can I do on both sides of my equation to get rid of my a squ If I multiply on both sides then I get A2 = X2 + y^2 or if I write that in Reverse so here X2 + y^2 = A2 what the heck what is that do you know what that is that's a circle that's exactly what that is it's a circle do you guys see the circle out of that the form of a circle is x^2 + y^2 = radius s okay so here's my question what is my a here boom and boom what is my a no look up here what's my a in terms of my circle a is my radius so this is really interesting but it's a way that we can describe a circle without an equation in terms of X and Y this is it this parametric equation gives you a circle it just so happens that my radius is this a so if this was a two and a two my radius would be a two that's right this is giving my radius right there now if we're to graph this thing where's the center of this circle do you know you should know or it's at the origin remember that with our circles whatever I would add in here or add in here whether it's like plus or minus that's going to shift our center around so in our case we're not shifted at all the Center's at 0 0 um again how much is the radius it's not two how much is the radius a it's a so whatever my circle looks like it's going to go out to a and it's going to go up to and it's going to go left negative a and down so our Circle will look like by the way I'm horrible to drawing circles I'm not good at all obviously this is nasty but it's a it's a horrible Circle but let's pretend I'm good and it's perfect uh that's the cir man that's really bad too my bad it's okay I got to make it better it's okay so mine yeah but you're not being that's even worse okay whatever it's my circle uh so what this says is if I can get maybe my trig functions isolated and I can use an identity put them together you can make some sort of a a picture of what your graph looks like that's nicer than just looking here now eventually you're going to get so used to this you're going to look at that and go oh yeah that's a circle how is it a circle your numbers are the same if your constant is the same and you have cosine and sign that thing's going to be a circle you're going to get used to drawing a parametric equation like that with your radius of a so if this was a two and a two I'd have my radius of two show F feel okay with that so far now here's the issue where's it start where do it stop what direction is is it going do you know no no not unless I give you an interval so I want to be be real sure that you're clear on this one do you guys get the idea of using identity put these two things together in a relationship that relates X and Y so that you can have some expression in terms of X and Y that you can graph you you with me on that one next do you understand that without an interval I don't know where this thing starts I don't know where it stops and I don't know the direction that it's going do you guys get that okay so we're going to practice a couple intervals so let's say for the interval 0 to Pi for the interval 0 to Pi here's my question if I give you the interval 0 to Pi am I asking you to plug in Zer for X and Y or a am I asking for that what is the 0 to PI what's it relating to what variable up here not time in this case dire Theta it's relating to Theta the parameter so the interval that you get for a parametric equation is always excuse me relating to the parameter so in our case it says hey you know what um if theta equals z could you find me X and could you find me y if theta equals Pi could you find me X and could you find me Y what are you going to do are you going to use this to find X and Y no go back to your original the parametric equation so uh let's do this together okay okay if Theta equal 0 if theta equals 0 am I going to plug something in for a no okay so if theta equals 0 how much is cosine of 0 what's 1 * a so then X would equal what a very good x = a and Y um remember remember we use the same Theta for both of them that's how we get our X and that's how we got our y that's how we started this whole lesson was you plug it in separately for X and Y independent of one another so if Theta now equals where are we at zero if th equals 0 what's sign of Z what's 0 * a z perfect now what's cool is that that point must be on the picture that you just drew it's got to be there so let's look do we have a point of a comma 0 yes can you plot it on the graph is it here no is it here no is it here yes that's a z so this right here check it out like it's got to make sense for you okay do you understand that R Theta is going to start at zero because that's the parametric interval that we have so when I plug in Theta equal 0 I find my initial Point does that make sense so this is initial point now our interval stops at theta equals Pi so whatever I get here that's going to be my terminal point now you help you understand that idea so hey you know what Theta goes from here to here in order in that direction so it starts at zero therefore this is my initial Point stops at Pi therefore if I plug in Thal pi to my parametric equations up here I'm going to get my terminal point so let's do it if I plug in pi let's do our X first how much is cosine of pi what's 1 * a how much is s * pi 0 * a is this also on our graph somewhere it better be otherwise you did a graph wrong okay it's got to be there so where's negative a comma 0 this one that now is my terminal point so here's the 10sec recap before we figure out the direction okay and Direction be very easy um first thing find some way to relate an equation that contains both x's and y's that will give you an idea of the picture of this graph do that always even if it's hard to make the picture it'll at least give you like symmetry or something so that you can somehow make your picture does that make sense it'll it'll limit the amount of work you have to do as far as plugging in points it'll really help you so even if you got to use identities like we did here get a get a parameter by itself to do a substitution like we did in the first three examples or get at least a trigonometric uh expression with your parameter in there and then use an identity to relate them not a big deal we know the identities make your substitutions you now an expression in terms of X and Y hey that's a circle Center 0 0 your radius is a draw your picture after that take whatever interval I'm giving you find the starting point your initial point just plug in the first first uh parameter sorry um evaluate the parameter for whatever your interval starts at evaluate your parameter for whatever your interval stops at that's your initial point and teral Point respectively so here's what we know we start here we stop here the next question is what direction are we going are we going this way we're obviously going one of these ways correct we got to be going either this way or we're going this way how could you figure that out say what now there say it does but that just means our radius is is not a negative radius cuz that'd be really awkward to draw a circle with a negative radius you're Circle someh A being greater than zero means our radius is positive it's just saying that your circle has a positive radius um tell you what we start it do you know what what this stands for is this x is this y or is this thetaa and Theta is an angle right can you give me some angle between 0 and Pi plug in pi 2 should plug in pi two plug in something between there to give you that relationship so if I plug in Pi / 2 it's going to be easy just plug in pi over two plug in pi over two here uh everybody what is cosine of pi over 2 what's 0 * a okay well that's right oh sorry that's wrong uh plug in s of pi/ 2 what's s of Pi 2 what's 1 * a a and there you have it so where's our where's our Middle Point okay let me go back 5 Seconds do you understand that pi/ 2 is right between these things so that's going to be a point either here or here it's going to be right between them um is it the top a or the bottom it's right there does that give you the direction yes it says it starts here it goes through this point and then it goes through through this point so it's going this direction I missed it's going that way in fact does it make it down here so sometimes our formula in terms of X and Y gives us more of the graph than we even need here's what this says this says that this thing is going to make a circle are you following me along here this makes a circle we've just proven why it's it's going to be the whole circle an interval is going to cut part of this graph so interval says if you start at zero and you end at Pi you don't even have this that's not even there it's just starting here going along the top half of the circle and ending there show hands if you okay with that one okay if you're okay with that what would this be if this 0 to Pi is a half a circle in this direction what's 0 to 2 would it still start here yeah would it end here no no where would it end it would be the hole that would be one full circle but it would still have the same direction it still be a counterclockwise Direction don't you have you understand that one so full circle same direction how about this one would it still start this now 0 to 4 Pi would it still start at this initial point would this be the terminal point no 4 Pi not 3 Pi would this be the terminal point yes yes it would do yeah here's Pi 2 pi 3 Pi 4 Pi does that make sense same direction so you're going around it's like it'd be like you start at 3 o' on the on a on a clock H the name o clock anyway three on the clock so we'd go backwards we go back in time on back in time to 3 o' and then back in time to 3 o'clock again and do two full rotations this would be two circles but it's in a certain direction and why that's important is because sometimes Direction on how you rotate is important um when you get to calculus 3 you're going to have that idea that you're spinning one way or you're spinning another way that's kind of a physics idea as well so whether you're going up an Axis or down at a different axis show hands feel okay with with this idea okay good deal now can we extend this idea just a little bit further yes no yes you ready for it I'm going to go quickly through this one as well and now that we have this idea this will be a little bit easier so your ideas first thing find some curve that you can SK that's what we did first right we just did the circle then find the initial Point that's easy just plug in where your interval stop starts find your terminal point that's easy too plug in where your interval stops so once I give you interval that's easy to do after that find the direction plug in some midpoints and then you can find out where that thing goes whether it's up or down or left or right and that's the way that we go about doing these sketch your graph initial Point terminal point Direction that's the idea let's try that with this one okay true or false this is a parametric equation true then you got to tell me what the parameter is not the interval the parameter Theta what's the parametric interval so Thea is traveling between Z and Pi true or false this is a circle false why the radius is not the same so if this had been four and four would that be a circle yes if this had been three and three it'd be a circle if it's four and three is it a circle no is it similar to a circle what do you think this is lips you're exactly right this is exactly what this thing is going to look like now we're going to see that when we try to do the same thing okay so we don't have a anymore we have actual numbers makes things a little bit nicer to graph so if we're to solve for our parameter we can't quite get there we don't want to do cosine inverse or sin inverse that's crazy okay what we do want to do is isolate as much as we can so cosine Theta is x 4 sin thet is y 3 could I still use the same identity to put those together well I know that s^ s plus cosine squal 1 I can do that here so 1 = cosine 2 I'll put in this order because I like my x's coming first plus sin^2 no problem do our substitution that gives us 1 = x 4^ 2 + y 3 2 because I have cosine squar I have S squar so this is s hey sin squ that's Y 3^ 2 show if you okay with the algebra on that one simplify let's look at what this gives us we get 1 = x^2 over 16 we get y^ 2 over 9 if you've ever had any intermediate algebra or pre-calculus which I know you've made it through you should remember that this is the formula for an ellipse it's exactly what that is in fact when you when you know that this is a radius squared this is kind of like the idea of radius squared it's just this is in the X Direction hey it's under X this is in the y direction under y so what we get out of this we get an ellipse within the X direction we go four you see where the four is coming from and4 in the y direction we go three and3 this is 4 S and X Direction go four and four this is 3 s y direction would go three and three and that's where those numbers are come in from by the way do you understand why I have this centered at 0 0 yes yes why is it centered at 0 0 X and Y don't have any plus or minus very good so if I have no plus or minus it's not shifted and centered at the origin could you make this centered not at the origin sure if you wanted to you could do that uh you'd have something like four cosine Theta and then you'd have like plus two minus one something like that where when you solve for cosine Theta you'd have that addition or subtraction on the numer of your fraction so can feel okay with that idea now we're going to keep it simple just have it centered to the origin makes things kind of nice for us so let's graph it by the way my ellipses always look like Stewie heads or footballs which are the same thing so it's going to be awful uh but try to make yours better oh man that looks like Hey Arnold hey feels like an egg I told you I'm not very good at this I wish I was I had a professor one time who could draw perfect circle now you can jokeing like perfect I did tell you he's also a very bad teacher so wasn't your I'd rather be a good teacher and not be able to draw circles than a bad teacher who draws perfect circles cuz then what use are you anyway I bet he's a good art teacher I don't care what he is he's hor did you say he was a physics teacher physics teacher man it was horrible anyway it doesn't matter um so what I want to know is have I explained this well enough so to get a bad ellipse out of this parametric equation you can follow this down yes try to isolate a parameter if you can't at least isolate a trigonometric part part of that parameter use an identity to put them together in terms of X and Y so you at least get somewhat what your picture looks like this gives you exactly what your graph looks like it's an ellipse in the X Direction it goes 4 and4 and the y direction goes 3 and3 draw your picture and now now after you've done the picture this is when you plug in points not before this so as soon as you have your picture you go okay let's start plugging in points from our interval where does our interval start so theta equals z should give us something and where's your interval end I'm leaving some space here on purpose because you're going to see why in a minute = 2 pi should give us something uh what is Theta equal Z going to give us our initial point or our terminal point very good and what's the 2 pi going to give usal that's where our interval goes say Starts Here ends here goes in a certain direction now where do we plug in this zero and the 2 pi do we do X and Y or do we go back to our original original okay this is what the par equation is all about it's using Thea X and Y so plug it in uh what's cosine of Z so X would equal and Y would [Music] equal sure sign of 0 is 0 0 * 3 is 0 we get 4 Z hey is 4 Z somewhere on your graph hey where is it at at 4 Z that's why we grafted it so it's it's got to be there uh what point is that again initial okay now let's plug in the terminal plug in 2 pi everybody what is cosine of 2 pi please one one 4 * 1 what is s of 2 pi 0 * 3 hey is 4 Z on your graph wait a minute we just plotted that is that possible yeah it just says that what's happened here is you have an initial Point that's also your terminal point why cuz we make it how many times around this ellipse just one time think about how the angle would work here Thea is an angle right it just says you're going zero you're making it one time around in this case well that's the way we can think about it is not exactly that way because we can change an angle but uh in our case we do one rotation around that ellipse we have an initial Point that's also our terminal point does that make sense now to prove that you only go one time around this and not two times or three times or something crazy if our angle is a little different what you have to do is plug in some points between there so I'd plug in points like well give me an easy one to plug in between zero and 2 Pi Pi be great give me another one pi over two and plug in those values and that way you determine that you don't go around more than one time you don't just want to make that assumption okay so because right here if you did that if you plugged in zero and 4 Pi you're still going to get initial terminal but you're not going to know it goes around twice unless you plug in those middle values make sense so we're going to plug in stuff like Pi we're going to plug in stuff likea / 2 Anda = 3K / 2 and we're going to get a variety of points but notice what I'm not doing I'm not plugging in my points first I'm not plugging my thetas first I'm getting my picture first that's important you want to figure out what it looks like that way you can put where starting point is on the graph and you can determine where all your other directions go not your directions your direction is and what your other points are already on the graph for you so if we plug in pi what we're going to get is -40 that's here if we plug in Pi / 2 we're going to get zero and we're going to get three here we're going to get zero and we're going to get -3 and what that shows you is that if you go in order it says we start here at 40 then then we go to 03 then we go to -4 0 then we go to 03 and we finally end up at 40 so we're going in this direction now we make one full rotation so what you do sketch it label your initial point it's got to be on your graph otherwise you've done this wrong label your terminal points got to be on the graph otherwise you done it wrong and then label your Middle Point somewhere that gives your direction CH hands have I explained this well enough for you okay we're going to do one more are there any questions before we keep on going you sure you're good with it it's not that bad right as long as you know to relate in some sort of a formula with an identity if you don't have this part then this is why I asked you to look at those trig identities before you start this lesson so if you don't have that part you oh man what am I supposed to do here just pluging a whole bunch of points it's going to take you for if you don't know what this thing looks like it's going to take you forever to actually figure out what's going on not forever but it's gonna take you a lot of plugin in points okay man what am I supposed to plug in I don't know uh well it's gonna take you a bit you know what the picture would like okay shoot that's a circle Starts Here ends here it's got to go either this way or this way plug in one point you're done all right same thing with okay last one this is a little bit more advanced so I want to walk you through one that is a little more difficult so you get used to it okay here we go so are we always going to be given an interal if you're not then you assume it goes from negative Infinity to Infinity all right with a trigonometric function like this because they are cyclical circles right or ellipses or what this is not going to be Circle well I'll get to that minute um it's going to often times repeat and so generally you're going to be given an interval for that because you got to have a starting point somewhere right got to land on the paper um the object has to land on the paper or on the plane and then go around it so no I think I gave couple in the last part of this lesson like last time where I didn't give you an interval um like the square root of T in which you said well the natural domain for for that parametric for that parameter is zero and positive well that gives it to you but then I gave you another one where it was T and then t^2 in which you don't have one you have to assume that your T starts at negative infinity plus plug that in figure out where your your graph starts that's why you graph them first CU what if I didn't give you an interval you literally have nothing to plug in right how you going to do that so you got to figure out what the graph looks like first before you start plugging in parameters can't do it can't do it done don't do that okay all right now let's walk through this one I'm going to try to go a little slower but we also need to get this done in this lesson so if we have xal sin T and y = sin 2T start from the beginning what type of an equation is this parametric equations right here what is the parameter in this case what's the parametric interval very good okay so we know that we're going to have a starting point at t 0 ending point at T = 2 pi true or false this is for sure a circle false false doesn't look very it doesn't look at all like what we've had before what we had was something cosine and something something sign and we had Theta and Theta or T and T you with me the parameter doesn't matter really what it is in our case um T is going to be like an angular relationship here so it's not going to be a circle we're going to have to do some work to figure out what this is now the idea is you want to try to isolate the parameter or at least if you're given trigonometric functions isolate a trig function with the parameter in it which is also isolated so for instance this one can I isolate the T do I want to isolate the T with a sin inverse don't use inverse can I isolate the T no can I isolate the s t done that's nice can I isolate the T no you don't want to use sign inverses can I isolate the s t that's what I'm going to work on okay I don't want to isolate sin 2 T I want sin T in there somewhere so if I start with like y = sin 2T so here's the start of our example if y = sin 2T that's really not what I'm looking for and the reason why I'm not looking for it is because I'm going to try to do this again I'm going to try to do cosine squ Theta or in this case cosine Square t and sin Square t if I have 2 T that's not going to fly very well make sense use an identity do you know an identity that gets rid of that two yeah yeah so maybe we got to use that you guys okay with this so far you sure now why you try to isolate those trig functions is because a lot of times when you're doing this if you've isolated the trig function it's going to give you an expression in terms of the other variable check this out do we know how much sign T is yes this right here is X so y = 2x cine T now can I isolate a parameter even if it has a trick function around it and make it in terms of X and Y alone are you listening to what I'm saying can I isolate the trig function here even if it has isolate the parameter even it has a trig function around it and make it in terms of X and Y how would I do that isolate say what divide by 2x okay so I get y / 2x = cine T I know that some of this is like wow what what why are you doing this um the idea behind this is you want to get a parameter isolated so that you can make a substitution or if you can't get a parameter isolated like in this case if you can't do that at least find something you can use in an identity a nice identity that will allow you to put those parameters together okay so for us we go hey parameter isolated not really but with a trig function yeah it's good this equals x why we get that is so you can make a substitution right here for an identity that's useful for you okay this one not good at all we can't we can't put this in an identity and make sense out of it where we can make both of these things together that won't there's no identity that allows you to put sin T and sin 2T together besides well this one right that that's it so what we're going to have to do is make this identity here well if you do you immediately can plug in X for s t that's nice this is x s t is X as given by definition of our parameter so that's cool now as soon as you make this into an X can you solve it for the other one and as soon as you do that as soon as you solve it now we have sin t = x we have cine T equals something in X and Y now let's use that identity so if we have 1 = cosine 2 t + sin 2 T stick with me here folks do I have an expression for cosine t y okay so if cosine T is y 2x then cosine 2 T is y 2x^2 plus do I have an expression for sin T that was the easy one that was given to us like that it's so if sin T is X then sin s t is x^2 so P feel okay with it so far all right let's continue working then uh let's start simplifying so this is 1 = y^2 4x^2 + x^2 so far so good this is nasty do you know how do now this was cool over here right the graph was very easy to see this was simply an ellipse is the graph easy to see here okay so simplify it a little bit if you can work with this then multiply everything by 4x^2 cuz I don't like denominators okay so 4x^2 = y^2 + 4 x to 4th can you follow me on the algebra maybe you get everything to one side we like functions looking like that so subtract this I get 0 = 4 x 4 - 4x^2 + y^2 can you verify my algebra on that one yeah subtracting this plus that now oh man so if hands feel okay with the algebra the idea behind it so again the idea isolate a parameter if you can't if you can't at least isolate the function around your parameter like sign or use an identity so that you can isolate cosine T isolate something you might have to use a substitution just to isolate that you with me on that one you sure mhm okay well then use an identity and put them together so if I have cosine T and sin T I know I can use this identity paging identity work it out make them in terms of X and Y the reason why we do this is not necessarily we like getting the picture right that's nice that's awesome but even if we can't get the picture for instance uh do you know what this graph looks like is this a circle no an ellipse no look like anything you've ever seen before probably right no it doesn't but at least it will give you some hints as to what this picture will do so that you can plug in less points the least amount of points possible for instance if I look at this do you see how my x's are both being squared what that tells you is that in terms of X this is an even function that means it's going to be symmetrical about the not the xaxis the Y AIS remember even functions how they do that basically it says this if I plug in negatives listen to why I know some of you know the term even function but you really don't understand what it means what it means is that when you plug in positives and when you plug in negatives you get the same thing out because you're taking to the second power and to the fourth power that means if I plug in two or -2 I get the same output does that make sense that means it's symmetrical about the Y AIS so these things right here this says it's even in terms of X that means symmetrical about the Y AIS what's that one tell you if Y is being squared about the xaxis that's right because when I plug in y = 1 or yal ne1 I would get the same X Out okay well that means it's symmetrical about the x-axis so here's the point I'm trying to make even though this doesn't give you an exact picture of what this graph is going to look like it tells you that it's symmetrical about the X and symmetrical about the y basically you just need to plot the points in quadrant one and then you get quadrant two for free then you quadrant three for free and by uh the transit property you get quadrant four for free I'm sorry I what I going backwards for you guys so you'd get if you do quadrant one you get quadrant two for free and quadrant four for free therefore you can get three either way you go so if it's if it's reflected across the y AIS and the x-axis or the xaxis than the y- AIS it's hard to move my hand that way you got to excuse me uh somehow you're going to get this one this one and that one that make sense okay that limits the amount of work you have to do you have to plug in every single value from 0 to 2 pi that take you a long time so by doing this well we figure out that we plot quadrant one and then we're going to quadrant two 2 4 and three and the direction has to work work with this uh so if we do quadrant one and the direction it's going to give the rest of it up for basically three so it's not useless this gives you a lot of useful information so what we're going to do since we have this goes through all four quadrants let's plot just the first quadrant so 0 to Pi would give us the first two quadrants 0 to Pi / 2 would give us just the first quadrant does that make sense so we're going to do a whole bunch bunch of points but they're all going to be in quadrant one so let's start here so what we're going to do is we're going to find some points between 0 and Pi / 2 and use symmetry to give us the rest of them what are some good values to plug in for T I know is one of them obviously and what's another good one we're going to plug in oh yeah Pi 2 yes Pi 2 we're going to need that Pi six is a good one yeah pi over 4 is a good one pi over 3 is a good one now put them in order what's in the middle what's in here six good six is here and Power Three is here is that okay yeah it's helpful to know a unit circle where are we going to plug in these T's are we going to plug it in here no no here here and there so don't forget then when you plug it in here how's that work what should you do two before you do the sign or after you do the sign okay so that's important that you know that so when we plug these things in I'll do it with you uh because we got to kind of go fast but I'm sure you can do it on your own let's take zero so we're going to plug in our T because it's a param equation to the parameter where we get our X and our Y coordinates from so what's sign of zero so therefore X here is z uh what's what's 2 * 0 of Z so we start at 0 0 I'm going to do this as we go our first point is what what do we call that I know it's the origin but in terms of that's very good initial point and the origin you're both right my bad I should have been more specific initial Point very good now well how about Pi 6 let's do uh let's do s of Pi 6 what is it and remember what you do here you do 2 * / 6 that's Pi 3 what's sign of Pi three okay how about P or four let's do sign of 4 what is it how about oh how about this one what's what's 2 * 4 2 * 4 is what's s of2 how about Pi 3 what's s of Pi 3 we already kind of did it that gives us our x coordinate now remember we multiply by two so 2 * piun 3 is 2 piun 3 what's s of 2 pi 3 you know look it up look at your I'll do the hard one for you okay I'll do this one and you guys you guys take care of that louder Jessica so s of Pi / 2 s of pi/ 2 is one and then if I do well 2 * 2 is pi s of Pi is I already did it for you oops zero figure that one out [Music] yet it's positive all students so sign is positive for the first 0 to Pi so um let's see sign counts up S counts up so s goes 0 over two then 1 over two actually of 0 over 2 of 1 over 2 of 2 over two of 3 2  3 over2 so where is 2 pi over 3 2 pi over 3 would be this would be pi over 3 and then this would be 2 pi over 3 so it's root3 over two double check that for make sure I'm not wrong too am I right that's right let's plot those points all right can you plot those points are they all numbers yes all right we already had the initial one 0 0 what's the terminal point for this uh this like sub interval that we have what's a terminal point so I know I'm going to make this kind of extended that way we have a good graph here so here's one let's make sure we get one right one and one okay here's what we know we know it starts here and it's going to end for our little sub interval at 1 Z quick head now if you're okay with that so far all right is it just going to go no darn it that'd be cool right this goes like this no it doesn't do that it goes along this course so we have 0 0 it's going to end at 1 0 for this little sub interval the next point it's going to go to after 0 0 is SO2 is right in the middle < tk3 over2 how much is root3 over two is it more than one or less than one it's less than one right let's just we're going to approximate right about there now when I plug in < tk2 2 < tk2 over2 sorry I'm going to plug in 4 I get < tk2 over2 and 1 where's < tk2 over2 in relation to 1/2 is it more than 1/2 or less than 1/2 it's more than 1/2 but it's less than one so if I plug in X = < tk2 over2 and 1 I'm going to get something right here how about < tk3 /2 < tk3 over2 where's < tk3 over2 in relation tok2 two is it so here's < tk2 over2 is it to the right or to the left to the right but not very much not not a whole bunch as right about here and then do we go up to one or just under one actually the same exact level as that was here's how our graph looks show pant feel okay with those points there's points on the graph use your calculator if you want to approximate with uh with decimals so this goes up to this point and then down to one I know I'm not a great artist but do you guys see the way that this graph should look yes no what direction is it going is it going this way or the reverse way way number one or way number two way number one now this is what is nice because we've already determined this is symmetric about the X and symmetric about the Y where is it going to jump to Now is it going to jump to quadrant number two or quadrant number three or quadrant number four it's going this way can can your bug do this I mean I know it literally can but can it can it stay on the plane and jump from here to here not unless it has like a wormhole a wormhole that's right you Star Trek dorks um Star Wars is where it's at fools just joking I like Star Trek too so it can't go from here to here that doesn't make sense it must continue along its path so here's how it looks it's symmetric so that means it goes like this but then it continues down here let's see uh right about there continues down here like this and does that do you see it and then it's going to continue well let's see this goes up or this goes down the direction goes up or down it must follow the path follow the path My Pan Learners starts here goes like this hits this one hey we hit our initial Point are we done no no cuz we also know symmetric about this and this so from here is it going to go down this way it's going to go up and you might want to plug in a couple points to do that but it can't it can't do this it's got to go this way so right up there second infity it's gonna continue this way gonna continue this way by the way could you plug in some points to to double check this you could always do that but at least now you have a picture of what this thing looks like it's nice lastly it's also symmetric about that we go this way and now we wrap it up so what's going to happen at zero we're here if I plug in pi over two I'm going to be here if I plug in pi I'm going to be back to here plug in uh 3 pi over 2 I'm going to be here plug in two P back to my origin so that is also my terminal but it does one full lap around that TR it's like a race car driver and then turns and it's going back to start and then goes around the other cor you ever seen those ones where they have like a figure racing that's crazy stuff that's what this is show hands that one made sense for you cool can you do it I think you can with some sometimes

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 10.4:  Using Polar Coordinates and Polar Equations
so now for our discussion on Polar coordinates um I already handed this out to you guys but if you are watching this later get yourself this a polar coordinate graph and don't get dizzy oh you're tripping out now um get yourself one of these it's polar coordinate graph paper just type it into the internet and you can find it this will help you learn how to graph polar coordinates so this is what these people are going to be using uh for right now I'm going to just draw it on the I won't draw all these lines and stuff um because you'll be able to follow along if you have this so if you don't have this get it right now press pause and go polar cor graph paper enter and then print it and then watch this video okay that was for them word you guys since I like you guys I give you a present but there people have find themselves so polar coordinates this is a way to represent curves with something other than rectangular coordinates now we already learned parametric but sometimes it's easier nicer or more relevant to use polar coordinates and we're going to show I'm going to show you how to do that so it's just a different way to represent curves without x's and y's with something a little different here's how it works it's going to look really similar to uh a lot of trigonometry you've done because hey polar coordinates deals with angles it's going to be based on a lot of trigonometry so here it goes polar coordinates polar coordinates look like this we start with something called the polar axis which takes the place of the xais and then we have this point O which is our our origin so we have o the origin or the pole we got the polar axis this is always going to be our initial side like where we where we start our angle we start our motion so we start here at the polar axis and then we're going to go up or we're going to go down angularly around the pole does that make sense the pole is our origin uh it should be very similar to drawing any angle that you have ever drawn so we're going to start the polar axis we're going to go up or we're going to go down um with an angle Theta so we're going to go up and we'll have this other side now what's different about polar coordinates is it's not just an angle you don't go forever with a a ray a segment of a line you actually stop you have this this terminal point what that P is that P is defined by R Theta where R is the length of that segment and Theta is the angle in relation to your polar axis so Theta gives us our angle p is some point and R is the distance from o your origin your pole and P your point and the most basic sense of it that's it uh does it look familiar to you at least we' drawn lots of angles like this we have our initial side we have our terminal side for our Angle now that's just called the polar axis it goes around a pole that's our Point O our origin goes for some angle up or down we'll talk about positive versus negative in just a moment uh the distance of that between o and P is is our R uh it doesn't go forever you see in this way you could actually graph a curve and here's what it says go up a little bit and go out and then if I wanted to make a curve I could vary the r vary that distance and Vary the angle it would give me a curve around that does that make sense so the r is is some sort of a distance it doesn't just go on forever and ever and ever that doesn't happen with polar coordinates so couple of little notes for us if Theta is positive do you guys remember this if Theta is positive this means that we're going in a certain direction what direction are we going if Theta is POS positive yeah that's right counterclockwise would be positive clockwise would be a negative angle also it's interesting but your distance r r can be positive or or R can be negative as well and I'll talk about that in just a moment in fact let me do it right now if R is positive then how your angles look is this listen carefully because we're going to do a few examples but I want you to to really get it if R is positive then what we would do is we'd have our our polar axis and we'd have some sort of an angle Theta let's assume it's a positive angle it's going counterclockwise if R is positive we get that look to it we just get okay you use your angle and R is positive that's where your your side actually is are you with me on this one it's just like what we started u compare that to this if R and this would be some point R comma Theta notice how your your coordin orates are no longer in terms of X and Y your coordinates are given by the length of your ray oh sorry the length of your line segment and the angle that it's creating with the the polar axis does that make sense to you so it's not X and Y it's hey how long the the segment is and where the angle is in relation to your your initial side your uh polar axis now if R is negative here's how it works you'll still use your f you'll still use your your angle if it's positive will go clockwise if it's sorry counterclockwise if it's negative will go clockwise you'll still use that this would be where your point would be if you had a positive R if you have a negative R then here's what you do you use that angle you find where that point is and then you reflect that about the origin so basically you go okay well it's not over here a NE this would be a positive r a negative R goes 180 de in the opposite direction for the same length so basically for uh for negative R we use the the Theta as normal and then we just go in the opposite direction that's the the idea so be okay with this so far now take out that graph paper we're going to do a couple examples so just to get really used to this we go through maybe three four five examples whatever to so we feel comfortable let's start with something real simple we're going to start with 1 comma 2 piun over 3 now to get ju just to get started we got to be used to naming what these these coordinates are they're not x's and y's what's the one giving you right here one unit is giving the length so I want you to look at your your graph paper if you look at it there's some circles right there's some circles in your graph paper there's uh one little circle and then there's another one there's another one that keeps going out and out I see 1 2 3 4 I count five concentric circles did you guys see that too so if you have five concentric circles the distance of that first Circle would be a unit of one and then the second would be a unit of two and then three and then four and then five so if R is one you're not going to graph the entire length of your your circle you just go to the first little concentric Circle and that would be the your R make sense now I can't show that because I don't have this on the board uh but what we do here is we say okay well if you have this on your circles you don't need this this is a rectangular coordinate system I'm doing this just for for for the sake of quadrants okay so we see where the quadrants are so really this doesn't have to be here and this doesn't have to be here and neither does this one the idea is your x axis is like your polar axis your origin is still your origin now what's my R again everybody one what's my Theta 2 is it positive or negative so positive means I'm going to be going counterclockwise until I reach 2 pi so on your it's like a unit circle just has more units to it so go to 2 piun 3 is 2i 3 in the first quadrant is it in the second quadrant yeah so we'd say okay well 2 pi over 3 is roughly let's see Pi 3 roughly right here like that so that's 2 pi over 3 we always always label our polar coordinates always we label the angle and we label the distance are you with me always label it so um now we've done the angle but that that's only half the battle okay we've just done the angle now we got to do the the length of our segment how long should this R be so I'm not going to go forever I'm going to just go to for you guys it's going to be on that first little circle and that's where our point is so F you okay with that and this we label it as 1 comma 2 piun 3 that way we have a angle of positive 2 piun 3 counterclockwise we have a length of 1 one so far so good okay let's do some more let's do 3 comma piun over 4 don't label these X and Y axes they're not if you label it any anything this would be your polar axis this would be the p 2 axis this would be the polar axis in the negative direction or the pi axis 0 and Pi this would be the 3 Pi 2 axis they're not x's and y's anymore because we're not even talking about that okay we're talking about polar coordinates so let's start uh here's our polar axis we're going to start at the origin uh what's our R please R good what's our anglea so should I go clockwise or counterclockwise clockwise say it again clse clockwise from here that would be this way if this isun 2 thenk 4 it should be on your graph right 4 just well it doesn't say it might not say negative pi 4 it might say what is it 7 Pi 4 that's right and if you think about that here's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 4 is co-terminal with negative P4 okay we're going to label it we got to label it correctly the angle is going negatively at Pi 4 how long do I make my my segment here how long is that so I'm going to go to on you guys the third concentric Circle so one would be one two would be two three would be three on a graph like this this is why it's important for you to label it you don't just put a point randomly like this you say okay this angle is p 4 and we're going to three so we'd have 3 andk 4 and you'll that so here we have one so be located with the idea of polar coordinates easy medium hard once you get to hang a bit not too bad it's just an angle you know about angles and now that you have that nice isn't that graph paper nice isn't that kind of cool go oh yeah it goes out three it's kind of nice so let's continue we'll do uh maybe I don't know two more I'll show you what to do with negative RS okay how about this one so just getting the habit of it what's our R please what's our Theta is Theta going to move in the counterclockwise direction or the clockwise Direction counterclockwise counterclockwise from our polar axis how much is it going to go up or down up okay that is counterclockwise Pi 3 is right about there so we're going to label it positive piun 3 now here's the deal if we have positive 3 we also have an R of wait a minute so here's what we do and I showed you this up here if we stop this at positive2 is that my correct line no what I do is I find the 180° opposite uh Ray than that so for our case pi over 3 well we're going to go what is that line down here 1 2 3 4 pi over 3 did you guys find the 4 pi over 3 it's that the graph is kind of nice because you just follow it straight down but it would be 4 Pi 3 so we go Okay cool so we're going to go down here we'll have two and how we label it we don't label this as 4 Pi 3 what we label it as is -2 p over three we label the original angle that we had and then we label the negative distance out of that and that's the idea does that make sense to you so we've had positive angles we have negative angles we have positive R now let's do one last one and you guys went to the second concentric Circle correct okay what direction am I going am I going to go in the clockwise direction or the counterclockwise Direction quickly say it again what is it clockwise okay uh what how far am I going one okay that was very ambiguous question on my angle how far am I going three so this is one Pi this is two Pi this is three so when I do this you're gonna have to show that you go okay here's 1 Pi 2 pi 3 Pi we label that 3 Pi in the negative Direction so 3 Pi the direction matters here now how far out are we going to go one one so you're going to go to your first concentric Circle and label that one and this is the point one comma -3 Pi in terms of polar coordinates okay I want to make sure that you guys are okay with that so far that's pretty much everybody guys over here are we okay with it so you know how angles work positive angles mean counterclockwise negative angles mean clockwise negative positive RS mean you just go wherever you're at that certain distance so one or two or three or four negative RS mean that you go the the correct angle and then you just make it Opposite on the opposite line from that have I explained this one enough for you guys understand it okay now I want to get into something a little bit a little bit different I want to start switching between polar coordinates and rectangular coordinates and between rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates so I'm going to show you how to do it super not that hard okay not hard at all provided you understand what's going on on these polar coordinates so if we're to draw one of these if we just draw some general polar coordinate we'll have an R we'll have a point we have a polar axis and we've got an angle now our idea is let's translate between polar coordinates and rectangular coordinates if we do it well every rectangular coordinate in the world has an X component and a y component doesn't it well if we want to make an X component here's our origin where we start our X component is going to be which direction up down or left right and it's going to go over to however far that point is right there does that make sense and that would be our X component and our y component would be well how far we rise from here to here well that would be little bit that would be our y component does that look familiar to you what angle is that 9° we drop a perpendicular well now can we come up with some relationships with this angle and the triangle uh hello what class is that all about you've Tak trigonometry so some simple basic trigonometry lets us convert between polar and rectangular coordinates and here's how it works um we have a couple relationships with this we have cosine Theta we have sin Theta we have tangent Theta and then we have the Pythagorean relationship R 2 let's go over cosine we're going to go through very quickly because it's complete review uh cosine Theta is what over what isent is r s pyan r s x if we do just a little bit of manipulation with this well then what we can find is could you solve this for X how do you solve it for X well x = r * cosine could you solve that for y then y = r * sin thet uh do you guys see it we just have our x coordinate and our y coordinate that's really what we need for that that's it now a couple other things we're going to use we're going to use tangental YX we're also going to use this Pythagorean identity a lot so I'm going to write those well we already have them written down but this is another thing that we have so I'll write it twice R 2 = x^2 + y^2 these things are what we use to go between polar and rectangular coordinates now let's give this a try so let's say I give you 4 comma Pi 6 what have I given you have I given you rectangular coordinates have I given you polar coordinates polar what gives it away yeah the four doesn't CU you mean that could be an X but that that's definitely a polar coordinate because we got the pi over 6 now here's what I want you to do every time no matter whether you're going between polar and rectangular or rectangular and polar I want you to graph these first graph the point cuz what can happen especially when you go between rectangular and polar you can mess up the quadrant and so I want you to make sure these points end up in the correct quadrants okie dokie so let's graph that we're going to do it very quickly graph all these really quick you can do it on your graph paper you can do it uh just writing out like I'm doing pi over 6 you guys know where pi over 6 is is it up or down counterclockwise or clockwise that's right about there how far out do we go so you're going to go four concentric circles out so four and an angle of pi/ 6 here's the point no pun intended that is the point but uh the point is what quadrant is it in so we better make sure that when we convert this to rectangular coordinates that our rectangular coordinates end up in quadrant one it's got to be the same point it's need to represent the same point okay are you sure you're okay with this yes got to the same thing so do you know what your R is what your R do you know what your Theta is can you convert that using that formula yes it's really easy so the x coordinate would equal well R is 4 * cosine of isun / 6 might be useful to have a unit circle handy that gives you those relationships for like Pi s and cosine of pi 6 what ones are that we're going to use y y is going to equal well look at y y says take your R multiply by S of your Theta and if you do that you automatically get your rectangular coordinates really really really nice X is 4 * can you tell me what's cosine of pi 6 do you know that's what it is2 cosine counts down s counts up 4 * s ofk 6 1 so that means that we're going to get x = 2 < tk3 Y = 2 can you make a point out of that so write this as a point our point is what's the x coordinate and your what coordinate two so what we're saying here is that this point represented as Polar coordinates Pi 6 Sorry 4 comma Pi 6 where we have an angle Pi 6 and length of four is also represented by the rectangular coordinate 2K3 comma 2 is it in the same quadrant X is positive Y is positive it's got to be up there and that's exactly how you represent that make sense kind of neat right interesting at least let's do a few more to get the hang of this okay we're going to change this uh what have I given you have I given you rectangular rectangular have I given you polar what have I given you sure what tells you that one Pi yeah it's an angle okay so let's go ahead and we're going to change these into rectangular I want you guys to do it so all we need to do is identify the r identify Thea and use these two formulas X is given by this that's x coordinate Y is given by that that's a y coordinate go for it what should the first thing you be well what should you do first graph why do we graph make sure it's in the right corner cuz I told you to but yeah make sure it's in the right right leard said Leonard said forget Simon what quadrant did we end up in end up in three so our Point better be in quadrant 3 so we go okay well wait a minute uh X is R cosine Theta so x isk22 * cosine < 4 don't get these two things confused X is with cosine Y is with s which I guess that's that's not that's pretty obvious right because when you have a unit circle it's cosine sign isn't it that's X and Y X and Y same same thing so when we have this x isga < tk2 * > 2 2 and Y is < tk2 * 2 two wait a minute that's interesting what's this going to give you now why is interesting can you come with the point with these two yeah does that fit well with where we're at on our polar coordinates yes yeah that's a 45° angle from here that's right in the right in the middle of our 90° angle and it's down Square < TK of two well it's downare < TK of two that's 1 2 + 1 2 and then we take a square root so that's exactly what that is is11 show hands feel okay with our our changing now we can also go back we can change between rectangular and polar so we did from Polar to rectangular now rectangular to Polar this is where the quad really does come into play and you're going to see that on a lot of these examples so let's say that I give you this one -1 comma 1 is it apparent to you that that right there is in rectangular coordinates it doesn't have an obvious Angle now usually I'll be a little bit more uh explicit here I'll say change this rectangular coordinate coordinates pair into ordered pair rectangular ordered pair into Polar coordinates I'll tell you explicitly right now I'm just going to tell you in words that's rectangular we want to change it into Polar well what we to do what do we need to know in order to change something from rectangular to Polar right now we have X and Y what do we want to have for Polar we want R we got to have R what else do we want an angle an angle Theta that's right well you know what two of these things are going to give that to us and it's not going to be very nice to use these cuz this has both of our our unknowns in it doesn't it that has both of our unknowns in it both oh but this one this one has both of the things that we know in it doesn't it this one has both of the things that we know in it so to go from Polar to rectangular we use these two that's why I have listed to go from rectangular to Polar we use the other two does that make sense to you I'll show you exactly how how that works right now so uh r s r^2 = x^2 + y^2 so in our case uh we know X and we know y so let's do it R2 is going to be what please which equals okay okay how about R rals that's right sare root of two now kind of kind of and here's where it works um you see how when we do a square root you typically put a plus or a minus okay we're going to omit the Plus or the minus but that's what can mess up your quadrant is because we we get that right there so we're going to take care of the correct quadrant with our angle we're always going to try to make a positive angle we're always going to try to make it be in the in the correct quadrant but why you why this screws up is because when you take a square root we typically omit the negative here does does that make sense to you you understand why we can mess this up okay so R isun 2 that's nice we know how long this line segment is going to be uh what's the other thing we got to find Thea so here's part number one here's part number two if tangent Theta equal YX and again the reason why I'm using tangent right now is because it relates the two pieces we know we know X and we know y we didn't know R to start with we didn't know R to start with so if we know X and Y then tan theta equals what's our y yeah let's get this these ones right 1 over so that's going to be what's tanal 1 what's the angle going to be there do you know you actually have choices here there's a lot of angles that are going to give you tan Thal 1 a lot of them an infinite number of them we got to pick the right one what we're looking for is a positive angle between 0 and 2 pi we don't want like 77 pi over whatever I don't want that okay I want something between 0 and 2 pi I want to be positive so let's look at what happened this is what we should have done first this was a rectangular system so if we plot this points what quadrant is it in two yeah it's right there and what we want is we want to associate the angle to this and the length to this we want to convert that rectangular Point into a polar coordinate so far so good we've already done part of it we know that this distance is going to be the < TK of two but we got to pick the angle correctly so that we get the positive angle out of it what you could do you could say well you know what this is negative pi over 4 that would give that to you but then you'd have to use the negative root of two to get there do you guys see what I'm talking about since we avoided the < TK 2 we can't use thek 4 that's not going to do that so if ever you get the negative angle like man that's in the the wrong quadrant just add pi to it for tangent and it's going to make it in the correct quadrant so for us we we think about this first this is why we graph it first to make sure you have the correct quadrant so F if you understand understand that idea got to have the correct quadrant so plot your rectangulars first and then start looking for your angle so if we're going to be in quadrant 2 and we have to have tangent of our angle equal 1 we're going to have to be at 3 pi over 4 using your circle or think back to your trigonometry this is going to have to be 3 4 okay I need to make sure this makes sense to you this to me is a little bit harder than this one this's very straightforward this is a little bit different are you guys okay with that one yes are you seeing how important it is to graph your point first so you know what quadrant you're in okay now let's put it together uh what polar coordinates do we have what's our our point < tk2 and 3 that's it so we know we're going to go 3 4 and we have a length ofun of two and that's it so far so good are you sure okay let me show you one more and then we'll go on to Symmetry and how to graph these these St so I give you a rectangular rectangular coordinate system order pair 3a4 uh what quadrant is that going to me do you know four so that's going to be one two 3 1 2 3 4 so we're going to be down here somewhere what we want is that distance and this angle so far so good mhm let's do it why don't you guys go through it I want you to find at least the r go ahead and find the r right now and then get down to the trigonometric relationship that's going to allow us to find the Theta so go for it for let's see x² Y 2 R is equal to the square root of what 25 which is five oh perfect R is five I like it we already have half of our work done did you find R is 5 show you got it perfect okay now do you notice we're omitting the neg five mhm okay now what else do we need tent why tangent why are we using tangent not s or cosine what's tangent compare and that's what we want we're given an X and Y So Tan th equal okay what angle is going to give you4 this one was easy it's 1 it's somewhere that's actually on our unit circle yeah if it had been root3 over2 be easy or negative < tk2 over2 orative one2 positive2 or any any of those nice ones if it's not nice like this or it's not on your unit circle don't make it harder than it is how do you solve for angles do an inverse = tan inverse of -43 you with me on that one now here's the deal don't let me don't let me mess you up here but here's the deal check it out this tan inverse is based on4 over 34 or 3a4 it's going to be in the correct quadrant it has to be there but it's going to be negative this is a negative angle and I don't want that so here's how I know it's negative by the way positive angles give you positive tangents this is tangent negative angles give you negative tangents therefore when I go in reverse tan inverse of negatives give me negative angles tan inverse of positive give me positive angles this will be a negative angle but it will be in the correct quadrant here's how you remedy that if you have something that's in the correct quadrant but it's negative add a full circle to it just add 2 pi and it will make it positive so what we're going to do is we're going to add 2 pi and this is to make positive so now we have it our R is five it's going to be ugly looking but our angle is this listen this is our Theta right this is an angle it's tan inverse of -43 + 2 pi it's a stupid looking angle but that's the angle that's exactly what that is did that one make sense to you a little bit could that be considered like an answer you put down or do you actually have to use calc this is fine this is exact okay if you put your calculator radians and you actually do it you can find an approximation for that uh but if you did this in radians it's going to be negative it's going to be a negative angle we want just to add 2 pi to that or 6.28 roughly on your calculator and then you get that whatever that is can I can we move on a little bit okay what I want to do now as the last thing we'll do today I want to show you how to find a rectangular equation from a polar equation this is very interesting and very useful for us because we're used to rectangular equations we're not used to polar equations we need to get used to them we need to get used to look at them go oh that's uh ellipse oh that's uh whatever it is and this is one way that we do that we start by just changing some basic easat so right now we're going to convert a polar equation into a rectangular equation now here's the deal when you convert a polar equation to a rectangular equation we need something that relates these two ideas the only thing that really relates these two ideas to us is this the Pythagorean identity or the Pythagorean theorem for us R2 equals x s+ y^2 that has X's that has y's that has RS you with me the the thetas are going to be tied up into in one of these things so we're not worried so much about that right now uh well actually well I'll show you I'll show you how that that relates but start with something like the Pythagorean theorem or identity and try to work with it if you remember with parametric equations we actually did this did something very similar remember how we had like uh xal something cosine Theta y equal something sin Theta and we use the Pythagorean identity to put them together really similar idea so here we go R2 = + y^2 what we're going to try to do we're trying to make an r s up here somewhere now the only way that I can see how to do that is well what if I just multiply both sides by R well then what this this is going remember this is what we're trying to get is R2 equals equals something so to use a substitution so if R2 equals 2 * R * sin Theta well this is great if we have an r s now we can make a substitution to to change the r s into something in terms of X and Y remember a polar equation has RS and thetas right rectangular equations don't they have x's and y's so if I can find r s some somewhere in there how much is r s equal to so then R 2 becomes X2 + y^2 this is R 2 I'll do one more step in a moment quick show hands you okay with that so far now the next part of it this is kind of fun do you remember that x = r cosine the do you remember that y = r sin th remember that we had it up here a while back which one of these do you see in our equation right now X and Y I see X and Y this is this is I don't want to change it back okay I already had polar equation I want rectangular so what my goal here is if I'm listen listen I you need to get the goal the goal is if you have a polar and I want rectangular I don't want RS I don't want thetas I want x's and I want y's does that make sense so with our R we go let's just multiply both sides R we get r s that's X2 y^ s hey halfway done on the right hand side we got R sin Theta let's do it all at once how much is R sin Theta why because I asked you never too old to bring back that joke love that okay yeah you're exactly right so this is X2 + y^2 this is 2 y good two is there this is very confidently said I like when you're little when you're like seven why why why no no I said why hey is everything in terms of X and Y yes you're done that is a rectangular equation isn't it if it's all in terms of X and Y you're done now do you know what it looks like no can you make it into something you know what it looks like sure yes yes so practically you're done in actuality you can make it actually look like something and I'm going to do this for you so that you see what's going on I'm going to go move kind of quickly through it uh but here's the idea did I explain it well enough for you you guys to see that between polar and rectangular you want to get rid of RS and thetas you want to get x's and y's Square both sides if you have just an R hey that's x y s r sin thet is y r cosine Theta that's X we can put that in there so here we go let's say say I get everything so basically we're done but but not done we can do more if I get everything to one side I end up getting X2 + y^ 2 - 2 y = 0 yes no if I complete the square I get x^2 + y^2 - 2 y take half this number Square it add it to both sides remember completing the square yes that's now a perfect square trinomial x^2 + y - 1 this is half this number that's how you complete the square I don't have time to explain how to do that you should know how to complete the square but once we do we now have x^2 + y - 1 2 equals 1 and oh my gosh holy cow that's something that we should know what that is what shape is that in terms of a rectangular equation a circle everybody what is the radius of the circle remember this is the radius squared yes can you find the center of this circle zero nothing add subtract it's Z and it's opposite of what you want to say it is0 and the center 0 1 so this is really a circle the center is at 01 the radius is one could you graph it just go to 0 one for the center go up one left one right one down one make a circle and that's exactly what that thing is going to look like now that's a little bit more concise in terms of the equation but once we get a handle on oh well that's that's what this looks like that's a circle we can start seeing these things a little bit better we're going to get some really really cool looking graphs out of our polar equations that we wouldn't be able to get to get with rectangular or that would be really hard to get with rectang rectangular because with rectangular you have these problems with not being functions now that's not a obviously not a function it's a circle uh but we have some problems with rectangular equations that just make it really hard and so with polar we're going to learn how to graph next time we'll learn about Symmetry and then we'll learn how to use that to our advantage with me did I explain it well enough today for you okay we're going to graph some of these polar equations and the what I put on the board here is a way that you can eliminate a lot of the work a lot of the work here so we have symmetry you'll remember from like your your rectangular equations that we can if we can have even functions we can have odd functions we have functions that are symmetrical about well the X and Y axis like I said and and about the origin we have the same thing with polar equations so here's how you determine that if you can take so suppose we have some function R equals F of theta so that what that means that means that we have a polar equation here if you can take and plug in Theta and it gives you back your original function that means that this polar equation is going to be symmetric about the polar axis the polar axis is the one that goes this way it's the one where we start we talked about that last time so it's going to be your x-axis so it's just going to be flippy floppy across that axis does that make sense now if we plug in and this is a little weird but if you plug in Pius Theta and it gives us back our original function that means that we're symmetric about the pial 2 axis so uh th = 2 that is this one p/2 goes this way remember that from our unit circle and from our polar graphs that we we did this way so it's flippy floppy across kind of the Y AIS here that's the idea if we have this one which I don't know that we're going to use that very often but if we have when you plug in theta plus pi it gives you negative of our original function that means that we're symmetric about the origin you could take it rotate at 180° and that's the same exact symmetry that we're talking about your fans be okay with this now I'm going to show you how to use it right now so simple example not a hard one I just want want to show you one idea of symmetry I'll show you how to graph these then I'll kind kind of extend this concept so let's say that we have this equation r = 1 + cosine thet r = 1 + cosine Theta first first thing look for any symmetry well actually you know what the first thing make sure it's a polar equation is that a polar equation how can you tell it's polar R that's right are there any X's or y's no no X's or y's and there's R and Theta that means you got a polar equation here after you determine it's a polar equation cuz sometimes you're going to have to convert it into polar equations and that's can be kind of tricky I'll show you how to do that in one of these examples next thing we check for check for any symmetry so here's how you check for symmetry check for this one first go in this order so here's our symmetry let's suppose I have F of theta well F of theta is 1 + cosine Theta we know this because R is a function of theta so F of theta equals just that function so set your F of theta equal to your equation 1+ the right side of your equation 1 plus cosine Theta now how symmetry works is you take Theta or you take Pius Theta or you take theta plus pi and you plug it into your equation you plug it in here so we're going to say all right well um f of theta then is 1 + cine of thet quick head now if you're okay you understand the concept here so here's what we're checking for we're saying hey uh if I plug in negative Theta is it going to give me the same thing as when I plug in positive Theta because if it is that's symmetric about the xaxis the polar axis here make sense so what what we've done is said okay what we're trying to see is does this give me this if it does then these two things are equal well this is going to require you to use some identities so in our case 1 plus cosine of theta if you know this identity cosine of theta is the same as cosine positive Theta because if you think of cosine cosine is an even function it's symmetric about the Y so remember that one it goes this way it's it's symmetric you fold it over on itself what that means is that cos is the same as cosine Theta if you want to look up that identity it's in there it's there well now check it out is this the same as what we started with yeah so what that says is that F of theta hey here is the same thing as F OFA therefore this says and you're going to State this out this says that this is symmetric about the PO axis so you okay with with that one now we could stop there or we could check for more symmetry I'm going to stop there because I know it's not going to satisfy these other two and we can deal with this one a little bit differently than finding every possible symmetry so here's the idea think think about this think about why this helps you out if you know that something's symmetric about your x-axis your polar axis then if we can find this half we automatically find this half does that make sense so what we're going to do is we're just going to plug in the angles from 0 to Pi because if we can plug in from 0 to Pi then we can find out pi to 2 pi make sense so we use the Symmetry to eliminate like half our work or 34s of our work if we have double symmetry like across p/ 2 and the polar axis it's kind of nice so here's how I'm going to show you how to graph it um how to graph it first thing you do step one plug in points step two think that's it you got to think about it you got to take those points and think about how the Symmetry Works think about what the what the points are doing uh and I'll I'll show you that right now this is the reason why we learned how to plot polar coordinates is for this right here so one option you have and this is a really good option start by creating a table now the type of table we're going to use it it almost looks like a graph of x and y it's like a rectangular system but you're using R and Theta here now it's not this is not the graph of our function it's just a way that you can organize your points does that make sense to you better than a t table uh for us so here's what we're going to do we're going to have r on this axis we're going to have Theta on this axis use value OFA to find out values of R of course our R is our dependent variable Theta is the one that you pluging in stuff to okay that's your independent variable plug in this you get out that don't go the other way around it's really hard to do that so plug in values of your Theta get out values of your R also plug in values of your Theta that are easy don't pick up let's let's put in pi over 16 that's a good one no don't do that what are some easy values of of theta to plug in think easier easier Z zero let's plug in zero zero is a great one a great one now plug in some other ones Pi pi over six okay um when you do that we can plug in P over four I'm not going to plug in P six get a good picture without that one uh if you need to flesh this thing out more then you use stuff like Pi 6 Pi 3 let's plug in stuff like Pi / 2 let's plug in stuff like 4 let's do stuff like what's the next one 3K 4 let's plug in stuff like Pi again can you explain to me why I'm stopping at PI right now get half it get the other half I know I'm symmetric if I go to zero to Pi on this particular graph because I don't have a two Theta I just have a Theta right here if I just have a Theta that means I'm going to go from zero to Pi that's going to be My Graph the other half is going to be on the bottom side it's going to be symmetric about the the xaxis so if things feel okay with this so far yes no okay now let's plug them in uh we're going to go kind of quickly here because I'm going to assume that you're pretty good at plugging these things in so let's plug in zero where am I plugging in zero coine yeah let's plug in zero what's cosine of Z plus one so when I plug in zero notice this is not a polar graph right now all I'm doing is listing out my points if I plug in Theta equal 0 I I get out two does that make sense to you okay now let's plug in pi over 4 if I plug in pi over 4 what's cosine Pi 4 < tk2 2 < tk2 over two plus one plus one how much is that 1 1+ < tk2 over2 whatever that happens to be so 1 + < tk2 over2 okay that's up it's above one it's not it's not to two it's like uh 2.71 I think isn't it somewhere around there no I mean two cuz you're adding one to it so I I'm you're right one point shoot figured out what is that I lost track of my math in my head 1.7 something okay 1.7 you're right 1.7 uh let's keep going P pi two if I plug into 2 what's cosine 2 and then plus one so we're just using some Tri here all right how about 3un 4 what's uh what's cosine of 3K 4 NE < tk2 over2 okay so 1 minus < tk2 over2 how much is that 1- tk2 two how much is it about so we're done and then lastly we have so one minus so this is one this is 1us and lastly cosine of pi everybody what's cosine of pi 1+ 1 is how much okay so we have this idea our radius our R is going from two gradually down to zero does that make sense to you this giving you just a picture of what the r is doing what the length of R is doing now we're going to put these ideas together in our polar graph right now but I want to know firstly are you okay with getting all these points show hands if you are if is this a polar graph no it's just relating Theta to R so that we can follow it almost like a t table for X and Y now we're going to translate this to a polar graph so here's p/ 2 AIS here's zero so here we go hey um when our angle is zero what's our R when our angle zero so at angle where is angle zero where is it right on what right on the Polar axis so right here so when we're at angle zero remember all the graphing we did last time we that that's why we did this so we can plot these points that's the nice thing about it so we have this uh at angle zero we have two so we have one point right there so can you okay with this one so far now where's pi over4 so if that's Pi 4 what's our r value at pi over 4 about 1.7 or so so here's what we're going to do we're going to imagine this is 1.7 our point should be right there so just take that idea and move it up on that that line does that make sense to you are you sure I don't want to lose you here I want to make sure that you're okay with it do you get how we're taking these values and we're just now putting this them on this graph it's just a different way to think about it this was angled zero you had two hey angle of zero I have two angle of pi over 4 I have one I have 1.7 uh angle of Pi 4 I have 1.7 it's going to be less than this Distance by just a little bit so far so good now we go to the next one at Pi / 2 what's our R well that's an easy one at Pi / 2 we're at one that should be a little lower actually okay now at 3 p over 4 where's 3 pi over 4 yeah it's right here how much are we at 3 pi over 4 mhm so think about how much that is with a calculator or something plug in 1us < tk2 over2 get an approximation it's about 2 about3 yeah so here's check it out here's your here's your scale correct so we have 3 it's about right there and Lastly lastly when I plug in pi so I'm going when I plug in pi what's my r that means I'm at the origin okay I really need to make sure that you are okay with this do you see that at zero work two angle of zero we're at two angle of pi over 4 we're at 1.7 roughly uh pi over 2 we're at about one well exactly one atunk 3 Pi 4 We're AT3 at Pi we're at zero Oh wait we're at zero so yeah it has an angle but has no distance there we're right at the origin right at the the the pole honestly you guys feel okay with that one now we use this idea this this idea of well R is shrinking as we're going down to graph this so does it look like R is going to shrink the the r shrinking means that these points are going to always get closer and closer and closer to our pole because we always start here so how this is going to look it's not going to do weird things because our if it did weird things our R would be shrinking then expanding then shrinking and it's not doing that our R is is constantly shrinking constantly decreasing what this looks like is almost like the start of a spiral like that that's how that looks it's kind of cool right now what else do we know about this that's why we did symmetry so we didn't have to graph all the rest of it so if we know it's symmetrical then all we got to do is put these points at the same spots but on the other side of our axis and we get this that's does any know what that's called actually what's it look like if you turn your head to the side a heart actually kind of looks like a butt but it's not called the it's not called the buid it looks like a heart so they call it the cardioid uh this is called the cardioid right here and it kind of does look like a butt though doesn't it it's horrible I always thought like this should be the buyid but it's a cardioid because it looks like a heart I told you you're going to draw some pretty pictures today sure F feel okay with this one that's the idea find out if it's polar equation or not if it is great if it's not make it a polar equation after that find out your symmetry you could have three types of symmetry as I've talked about over here after you find your symmetry use it so don't be doing more work than you have to here if I know it's symmetric about the polar axis I'm going to go from 0 to Pi no problem flippy floppy right over the polar axis and we have ourselves our gra so far so good okay we're going to continue this are there any questions before we continue am I going too fast or am I explaining it well enough for you okay so let's do it okay R = 2 cosine 2 th what's the first thing that we look for in this type of graphing that we're doing what kind of Co yeah what time of equation it is is it polar is it rectangular what is it it's polar right now is it easy to tell for you yeah should be pretty easy there's no X's no y's it's just R and Theta so that's nice it's very concise too right I me it's kind of weird that that concise of a graph can give it give such a complex picture it's kind of cool so now that we've determined that this is a polar equation what's the next thing that we're going to do say what symmetry are we going to start plugging in points right now no it's a bad idea because we don't even know our symmetry don't even know what points to plug in so let's start plugging in some points I'm sorry um that was bad bad I said that the wrong way so we can't start plugging in some points if I said plug in some points uh we need to find symmetry so we know what points to plug in let's do our symmetry let's start with the same one let's start with we know that F of theta is 2 cosine 2 Theta let's think about F of theta F of theta what's the only thing that's going to change mhm so this would be 2 cosine 2 * well if you look at that 2 * is -2 now you guys tell me how much is cosine of -2 thet equal to according to the identity that we just used what is it it says here that cosine is same as cosine thet therefore cosine -2 th is the same thing as cosine 2 does that show you any symmetry in this problem right now look at how this when I plugged ineta gives us the same thing what we started with gives us our original function back right now what's that say how is that symmetrical very good we're not going to call the x axis we're going to call it the polar axis so this is symmetric about the polar axis honestly with f if you if you do understand why guys in the middle are we okay with that one yes no or are we if if we plug in negative Theta and it works out that when we plug in negative Theta it gives us positive the same function with positive Theta back again if it gives us a same thing back again we're symmetric about the polar axis so that's what we try we plug in negative Theta hey look at that it's the same thing but with negative Theta now the question becomes is cosine of -2 th the same thing as cosine of POS It Is by our identity we know that about cosine if I plug in one Theta or a negative of that same angle I'm going to get the same thing out so we say all right well when I plugged in the negative Theta ultimately it gave us back our original function what that says is that we're symmetric about the polar axis that's that's all we're saying right now now let's try another one I want show you this one let's start from the beginning so F of theta is 2 cosine 2 thet let's now plug in Pius the I want to see if this thing is symmetric about the y- AIS only we call it the th = pi/ 2 line we's see so if I plug in that uh what's this going to look like what's going to be there two's going to be there okay two and then what definitely going to be there two still going to be there now what's going to be here oh I like how you said parentheses you see why the parentheses are so important here because if I have 2 Theta and I plug in Pi Pi minus Theta that two is going to do what distribute so this is going to become 2 cosine 2 piun - 2 thet quick head on if you're okay with that so far just some trigonometry that we're going through right now so you okay with a little substitution this just goes in place of our Theta so if I go from here to here the only thing is changing is my Theta becomes Pius Theta all right let's distribute that not a problem let's use an identity here we going to have to split this up because right now I have no idea what that thing looks like at all I don't know what to do and I don't know if it's the same as that remember I'm ultimately trying to get back to see whether it's the same as this thing or not does that make sense are you sure okay so let's use an identity maybe like the subtraction identity for for cosine of of two angles getting subtracted so what that is is two I'm going to pull that two out because we're going to have subtraction identity here we have cine 2 pi time cos 2 thetus sin 2 piun * sin of 2et okay where am I coming from am I making this up no yes just making it up randomly it's complete magic what is that it's an identity that you would use right now have you found that identity yet have you looked for it hope I have it right you might want to double check me check it out do I do you have that identity down somewhere many chap yeah a long time ago in your Tri class it's in the back of your book too so we go right well this is the way the the subtraction Iden works for Co you say cosine of this time cosine of this minus s of this time s of that that's the way it works so let's keep on going uh can you tell me how much this is the fun part because we can actually use some other identities to make parts of this just disappear how much is cosine of 2 pi yeah same thing as cosine of zero this whole thing is one I want is s of 2 pi it's the same thing as s of 0 how much is it I hope that you said zero and we're just mumbling one mistakenly uh what's 0 time anything whole thing's gone what's 1 * cosine 2 so this is 2 * cosine 2 Theta minus wait a minute did it work for us did what type of symmetry do we have symmetry cross what it's like the Y AIS but we call it the yeah = 2 so this says CET about Theta = piun / 2 yeah it's like the Y AIS it's basically the horizontal axis from here and the vertical axis from here quick show hands if you're okay with that one that was a lot more advanced than the previous ones okay these are easy when you just plug in negative Theta it's pretty easy to see that right away either you have it or you don't this takes a little bit more work because when you do Pius Theta you're going to have to have some sort of subtraction identity if you did you know I I erased it but if you did theta plus pi you're going to have some sort of addition identity depending where they have sign or they have cosine about that does that make sense to you so you're going to have to have one of these identities here not such a big deal if you know it so we distribute our two okay then we separate this by their subtraction identity cosine and cosine minus S and S hey that goes to zero not a problem that goes to one 1 * anything gives you that anything back times two we have two 2 * cosine 2 Thea and that because this is exactly what we started with says that we're symmetric about th/ 2 so far so good now we know that this is symmetric about the x axis the Y polar axis in the Y AIS the equals what that means is that we only need to go from0 to where 2 we're going to do that we're going to go from 0 to pi2 because if we do that the rest of it going to be symmetric and then symmetric we go flippy floppy make sense flippy FL got my sunscreen I got my flippy floppies on a boat no yeah why aren't we checking to see if it's symmetric for the last um last one we don't need to because if we have this and we have this it's going to take care of both of them for us so we don't need to worry about that one I'll show you why just second I do want to make sure that you are okay on the Symmetry right now are you okay with the Symmetry okay then we're going to do the same thing that I just erased over here we're going to draw our kind of a graphic organizer saying here's our Theta here's our R and finding out what that those points are uh just it's almost like a t table for these polar coordinates so we're going to plug this in I want you to understand a couple things I know I've said it already but I want you to understand it do you understand why we're only going from 0 to pi/ 2 why on sure we got symmetry here and here so we only need to go from 0 to 2 cuz symmetry will take care of all the rest of it for us so far so good now here's the interesting part you see the 2 Theta because we're going from 0 to pi/ 2 it doesn't necessarily mean that our graph is only going to be between 0 and p/ 2 our graph could be in other quadrants but we get to use that symmetry from 0 to pi/ 2 to our advantage that's kind of nice I'll show you that right now also when you're plugging in points plug in nice points for your particular equation don't be plugging in always the same points I don't want to see always Pi 4 pi over two because sometimes they going to be nice all right plug in some nice ones here I'm going show you what I'm talking about so here's our Theta here's our R how far do we need to go two two we going to start now think about what we have what we're going to have to do here is we're going to have to plug in our Theta and multiply it by two and then do cosine of it so give me a good point to plug in Z zero is great yeah I already got zero and I got pi over two okay besides those two ones Pi 4 is a good one because if I do pi over 4 * 2 that gives me Pi / 2 you would do you know what cos 2 is then that's a good point so we're going to plug in 4 give me another one pi over 6 if I did pi over 6 it's going be pi over 3 I could do that one I could also do pi over 8 maybe if I wanted to I chose pi over 8 because if I do pi over 8 2 * pi over 8 gives me pi over 4 and cosine Pi 4 I can use that as well so you can do either one of those it's fine but pick some nice points to plug in are you with me on that one yes for instance I probably wouldn't be doing things like uh probably not pi over 3 because out of that quadrant I don't want to deal with that I want to deal with something that's in this within this range okie dokie so if I did pi over 3 that would be 2 pi over 3 that's not within that's it's going to be a little weird for our graphing so pick some nice ones I'm going to pick pi over 8 I'm going to put Pick 3 let's give a try let's plug in zero um everybody do this with me so remember that r r is equal to 2 cosine of 2 Theta what that means is we're plugging in our independent variable here of our Theta we're getting out our R and that's just going to be our distance you list them out right now plug in Z what's 2 * 0 cosine of 0 is 1 2 is start at two again let's plug in pi/ 8 remember that before you do the coine you get a multiply by two in this case what's 2 * pi 8 Pi 4 okay so if I have Pi 4 what's cosine of pi 4times 2 two which is 17 about I want to make sure that you guys are okay with that are you seeing where these numbers are coming from honestly are you seeing where they're coming from okay how about Pi 4 let's do that one Pi 4 goes here what's 2 * pi 4 pi over 2 very good what's cosine of pi/ 2 0 * 2 is oh wait a minute that's weird okay this is weird check this out let's do 3 pi over 8 two time this is why our it's unavoidable right now but our graph's going to get a little funky so check it out 2 * remember 3 piun 8 what's 2 * 3 piun 8 3 piun okay 3 piun 4 3 4 is what's cosine of 3 piun 4 2 over time 2 is negative root wa < tk2 yeah lastly let's plug in P two see how this one works out for us um p over two what's 2 * pi/ 2 please oh this is weak sauce what's 2 * pi / 2 very good all right cosine of pi is 1 1 * 22 sure enough it's negative is that okay to have a negative R yes did I teach you how to graph polar coordinates with negative R yes sure he did you know that so yeah that's here's what's happening first are you guys all okay with the point so fans if you are good all right so we're PL in some Tri angles no problem just PL in r r is going to start at a length of two it's going to work itself down to zero and then is going to bounce back up and have a length of -2 if we can graph this then we can use our Symmetry and get a really nice picture out of it you guys ready for it so let's go for it how I'm going to start this one I'm going to do all these angles first so all of our like our do dotted lines so that we get our our appropriate angle relationships here so I'll have Pi 4 if you have pi over 4 pi over 8 is not one that we typically uh graph with but where would pi over 8 be in relation to Z and Pi 4 yeah that's why we're going to use this one because it was nice to graph with that's why I picked it because okay you know what P's right between that's kind of nice to have that right there that way you're not worried about well where's pi/ 6 compared to that one a little little lower than that right I okay I'm sorry a little above that be hard gra so Pi 8 and then 3 Pi 8 is right between these two are you still so far so good yes let's graph so what happens when I have an angle of zero what's my R please angle of zero R is perfect angle of pi/ 8 what's my R so when I get to Pi 8 check it out here's 0 I'm at 2 pi 8 I'm at about 1.7 < TK two so we're going to imagine it to be right here and take it up probably right about there sare < TK of two guys seeing that we have the same exact values just organized in a different way this graphic organizer just let you see what the points are this is your actual points on Polar graph you with me next up how about oh wait a minute P four so P four I get that gives me something right on the pole now look what's happening this says that my R is decreasing and decreasing to here and then decreasing very rapidly so what's going to happen is this thing is going to go boom right there okay now this is what's kind of fun at 3 8 it says when I get to 3i 8 what's my R negative does negative go here no what do you do with those negatives 180 oh that's right it's like right down here does that make sense to you cool so you're going to go all right so down this way and it's going to be looks like the same distance as this guy but just down here so < tk2 and last one if I'm at pi over two that says go to your angle pi over two hey we're right here and then make it R of what please negative2 is not up two but down two I want to make sure that you are all okay with those points before we move on any further are you is this weird a little bit kind of cool though right a little bit cool so what happens is you deal with your symmetry first after you determine that it's a polar equation or you make it a polar equation here we have it we know it's symmetrical about about the polar axis this way we know it's symmetrical about the 2 AIS the Y AIS this way we know it's this way now well if we graph from 0 to Pi 2 yeah some funky things can happen we can have some negatives uh by the way one reason why we did this and why we didn't do the the revolving around the origin is because sometimes those take care of force we don't have to worry about it so in our case we have 02 hey no problem 02 we have pi/ 8 2 we have 4 and 0 that gives our origin back we have 3K 8 O but it's negative that's 180° different and then we have pi/ 2 but it's negative 180° different so here's what this looks like says our R is decreasing really rapidly then increasing really rapidly and then increasing a little bit so we have something that looks like this like that do you guys see the picture that I'm seeing out of that I know that you literally see it but you see why we get that picture do you understand why we do this and why we don't just list out our points this gives you a look at what the r is doing it's shrinking to zero and then increasing but negatively and that's why we get that that looking graph you with me now we get to use our symmetry if we do I know that this is going to be symmetrical I know this is going to be symmetrical I know this is going to be symmetrical I know that's going to be symmetrical what we end up getting is this it's going to be kind of sloppy but uh here's two cuz I'm not the best artist in the world I wish I was but we're going to get something that looks like a almost like a clover leaf so it's going to go okay out this way and then a crap down and then out this way and then back and out this way and back looks aad horrible ruined it killed it but that's the picture it should actually all go through the origin like a pretty FL um but that's the idea if you were to do this correctly it goes here make it symmetrical here make it symmetrical here make it symmetrical there I know I just brutalized this graph but I'm wondering if you get the picture pun intended do you get the picture here the idea depends if you do if feel okay with that one man I right side people I got nothing from you guys are you all right with it all right man I wish I was a better artist really do maybe I took more time but didn't let's see what if I did that what my picture is not good either that looks at least a little bad it should look more like that still bad still bad as long as you get the idea this is the the thing that we're trying to do have I made have I made it made sense to you explain it well enough for you okay we're going to go ahead we're going to do one more our last example it's better on my paper you know what I'm going to leave this I'm going to do it over here are there any questions on this at all you understand where our points are coming from and a wire graph looks the way it does because we have our symmetry yes sir okay then then I've explain it well enough this gives us this Symmetry and so from here go boom and you can go boom so this gives us here and this this gives us here and this this one you can get here or you can flip it so it flips basically every way possible because we have symmetry on all of our axes here which is kind of cool okay last one so I want us to sketch this X2 + y^2 2 = 4 x^2 - y holy crap what what in the world is that do you know what that looks like no yeah me neither have no idea uh are you supposed to know what it looks like no cuz that's not even polar right now it it's it's in XY and you'd have a hard time even plugging in points right here wouldn't you yeah because what should you plug in do you even know the points on the graph nope don't even know them so how would we even go about graphing this we could maybe do with some symmetry you could probably get some symmetry out of this uh but it's not going to be all that easy to do I'll tell you right now that squar that squared that squared that squared it's going to be symmetric about both the X and Y AIS just by looking at it do you guys see what I'm talking about so whether they're plug in posit X or negative X I'm going to get the same thing now we're going to use that to our advantage I'm not going to show you the Symmetry right now or sorry when we convert this I'm going to tell you this is symmetric about the x- axxis and about the y- AIS do you see why not I mean yeah why is right there but like literally do you see that whether I plug in positive or negative it's going to be the same thing same output okay and we're going to see that it's going to look that's why I left this on the board it's going to look really similar to that when I convert it and we're going to have the same exact results it's going to be um x axis means polar axis Y axis means p 2 axis so it's going to be symmetric about those two axes again I'll show you that right now so number one thing uh do we have polar do we have rectangular what do we have rectangular let's convert it here's how you convert it I'm going to go fast just give you a taste this is kind of like an extra example you don't really need to see this one but I want to make I wanted to give it to you so here's what we know here's our two conversions do you remember the next One X and Y R I know there's an r in there but is X associated with s or cosine okay I'm going to kind of do the lamb bam F pants math Go real fast on this thing so you might have to slow this down a little bit to do it on your own no big deal do you see an R up here no I do right there I see an R right there do you see the r that's an R use that to your advantage don't be changing that to R cosine Theta S and R sin Theta Square it'll still work uh but it'll take you a lot longer okay so if you have an R man this is now going to be R squ squar did you get that so this is r squ and then we still have a square equals four well there's not really a good way around this so we're going to have to have R cosine th 2- R sin Theta squ well that's X that's Y no problem so we got R 2^ 2 = 4 inside here we're going to have R 2 we're going to have cosine 2us R 2 and then sin^2 if we factor out the R 2 we get R 2 2 = 4 R 2 and then we get cosine 2- sin 2 now is a time where you start using some identities as soon as you have your cosiness and your signs without any other garbage around them this is R the 4 this is 4 R 2 this right here there's an identity that puts cosine Square Theta and S Square th together it's not one A Plus would be one don't do one please this cosine 2 the that's what that is if you don't believe me you can look it up it's there now tell me something I can do with my R squs div if I divide then this takes care of two of these I get r^ 2 = 4 cosine 2 now lastly I do want to solve this for R so what am I going to doot so r equal the square root of four cosine 2 thet there's one more thing I'm going to do it happens with this Four Square Four is yeah that's what I'm looking looking for right now that's converted to a polar equation now here's the point that I was trying to make earlier this is what I really wanted you to see from here on out you guys are going to be fine because you know how to plug in points right and we can find out symmetry right okay now here here's what I was trying to to to show you from the rectangular equation did you grasp the concept that this is symmetrical about the XA uh sorry the Y AIS and the x-axis did you get that it's all being square has to be now check this out see how we have the cosine 2 Theta see we the cosine 2 Theta that one worked out to be symmetric about the polar axis and symmetric about this Thal 2 axis I'm not going to show you but do you understand that that's going to work out to be exactly the same thing it's going to be symmetric about the PO axis and it's going to be symmetrical about the pial 2 you can show it if you want to only difference is that's got a square root around it it's going to work out to be the same takes a little bit more manipulation but it's going to work out to be exactly the same sh hands feel okay this is going to be symmetric about these same two axes you okay with that one I want to show you something interesting that happens here so we're going to have symmetric about polar Anda = / 2 AES this is what gets just a little bit weird uh you know what make it Thea and R we'll do this again and R if I plug in zero check it if I plug in zero What's 2 * 0 cosine of 0un of one one * 2 so I still have two now if I plug in let's do our pi/ 8 and Pi 4 if I plug in pi 8 uh we got to go quickly we're run out of time 2 * pi 8 is pi 4 yes cosine of pi 4 square root of < tk2 over2 it's like s < TK of two < TK of the < TK of two over the < TK of two * 2 it's a little awkward to do what I want you to get out of this is it that's positive do you understand it's positive it's up here somewhere all right yes let's do PI 4 2 * p 4 I don't want to go through the I don't want to approximate just once you get you this positive and it's up there a little bit uh 2 * 4 is what cosine 2 nice it's going to be zero so far it looks really similar to the last one that we did yeah but check this out this is what's important for you if I try to plug in the next one specifically if I try to plug in 3 pi/ 8 or I try to plug in pi/ 2 I want to show you just a pi two because you can probably follow a little bit better plug in pi/ 2 what's 2 * pi/ 2 now listen carefully what's cosine of pi what's 1 IM these are undefined so I don't have this it's outside of my domain does that make sense to you so you can show that with domain you can actually find the domain start and I used to do it that way U but if you plug in the appropriate points you're going to find your domain so our graph does this we don't have some some of the Symmetry that we had in the last example so what happens here is we're just going to graph from 0 to pi/ 4 at zero we were at two at pi over 8 we're about here at p over 4 we're at zero but that's all we have to go to can I go further no it's undefined so really what this this one doesn't have the extra little Loop here which means that all I can do instead of making this part symmetrical as well it's just this part that gets symmetrical what it ends up being is like an infinity sign now I want to stop and make sure that you really do grasp what I just said so Che you okay getting out of that far yeah are you okay that when I plug in points these two things are going to give me a negative inside of my square root that's a problem that means it's undefined it's outside of my domain so I can only go from 0 4 and then I'm going to use this idea of I'm symmetric about the polar and symmetric about the p/ 2 a so hey here's 0 to Pi 4 at 0 I was at two at Pi 8 I'm at H something positive but just a little bit less than two at P four at zero now we get to use our symmetry I'm symmetry this way and then this way but I don't have up here I don't have that so I'm going to have oh almost I was so close dang it come on Leonard that's the best I can do that's it so this part gave a symmetrical here and then these two parts g a symmetrical this way show hands if that one made sense to you okay this is the idea have I explained it well enough for you guys to to get it okay so find out your symmetry plot your points to where you need it if it's undefined well you don't have to plot those points and then just use your symmetry all right we're going to do the last little topic on Section on section we're working on on finding out how to deal with these polar equations in the next section we're going to figure out the calculus of polar equations so right now last thing we got to deal with is how to find tangent lines of these things so I want you to think of this it's not exactly like parametric but it acts a lot like parametric you see here's the reason why uh by the way this says for x = r cosine Theta and Y R sin Theta that basically just means this is for use with parametric sorry with uh polar equations that that's all that means but now look at this do you see how X is defined as a function of theta and Y is defined as a function of theta there it's not X is defined as a function of Y it's not Y is defined as a function of X so really there are lot like parametric equations do you see that so if I want to find a derivative if I want to find derivative of y with respect to X because these guys are not functions of each other the formula for our derivative is going to start out really similar to our formula for parametric equations really similar CU X is defined as a function of theta Y is Define as a function of theta you you Fen the the thought process here okay so let me show you what that's going to be so remember with with parametrics we had well if we wanted to find the derivative of Dy firstly you know what I don't want you forget what this is what is a derivative what are we doing here der a slope that's right so when we're finding the derivative we're finding the slope now what's interesting is that with these polar equations they make some weird weird curves right weird shapes we're still finding the slope as it as we remember the slope that's why it's dydx it's going to be a slope in terms of rectangular idea so a rise over run idea now have you understand that that concept so that's why we're not doing well let's just find the slope with respect to this or with respect to this it's dydx because this is going to give us the actual rise of a run quick head on if you're okay with with that so now when we had parametrics we did stuff like this we did uh do you remember it how it was Dy DT over DX DT do you remember that only now we don't have a t here we have a what so instead of dydt it's really just Dy D Theta instead of DX DT is just DX D Theta so what we're going to do right now is we're going to look at how to find the derivative of Dy D Theta and DX D Theta so we're going to take this off to the side for a little bit so remember this idea this is where we're going to come back to let's find out if we want to well if we want to do dyd theta what that is going to be so notice how Dy D Theta says okay uh well that says the derivative of y with respect to Theta that's the derivative of y with respect to Theta uh do you'all see where that's coming from let's really focus up here for a second so dyd th says take the derivative of Y that is y with respect TOA now here's the deal what do we need to do with this if I want to find the derivative of this this side we're good to go what's this do for us how how would we do that tell me something that you know about R con is it a constant does r stay the same for all those functions that we drew no no R changed and it was based on the angle do you remember that how R started at two a lot of the times for us on our examples by coincidence and and it going to zero so is r a constant definitely not a constant but R also was based on Theta wasn't it for a certain angle we had a certain R right and then we change for a different angle what that means is that and you should know this because we had this the whole time R is a function of theta R is a function of theta okay now listen oh put this together with your Calculus ideas we got R * sin thet sin thet is clearly a function of theta yeah what's going on between R and S and what's R function of so we have a function of theta times a function of theta what do I need here rule we need the product rule you with me go ahead let's do the product rule together all right so our product rule says we're going to do the derivative with respect to Theta of R so derivative of the first time the second plus the first times the derivative of the second well let's think about what this is now now listen carefully because we're using like three different ideas here okay we're using the idea that it's similar to parametric because they're not defined as a function of one another we can treat them as a function of theta and that's pretty easy we're using that well R is a function of theta therefore have a product rule going on do you understand why we have a product rule going on it's function OFA time a function OFA also R is a function OFA but it's not given explicitly it doesn't say R equals this it doesn't say that so if R is a function of Thea that's not given explicitly what type of differentiation do I need to use implicit implicit differentiation which means that every time we take a derivative of R look at this look at it says hey take the derivative of R what's the derivative of r d I don't know because it's with respect to Theta not with respect to R so you don't just go oh well it's one because it's implicit it's a function of theta therefore we say well the derivative of r with respect to Theta is Dr D Theta it's exactly what that is now sin Theta it says we don't touch the second one so times sin theta plus we don't touch the first one that's R and we multiply by the derivative of now this one's easy it's it's a function of theta it even has a Theta up there D Theta so what's the derivative of s of theta sure sh hands if you okay with with that so far do you understand the idea that we had to use implicit because R is a function of theta well we're taking a derivative with with respect to Theta we have to have drv Theta do you understand the idea of the product rule here okay the next one well it says well look at that all we needed to do to find our derivative Dy DX we needed Dy D Theta we've got it this is dy D Theta I'm going to kind of do a shortcut here I'm just going to State it do you understand that you could do exactly the same thing with DX D Theta do you guys get that with DX Theta you can even do it from here you'd say derivative of the first times the second plus the first times the derivative of the second which is negative sign hence we get a minus okay I want to cck show hands if feel okay with that so far you sure sure you're sure all right let's put it together so we have this we said all right no problem uh Dy D Theta that stands for a slope just like we always think of a slope so even though we have these weird shapes that we're getting on these polar equations the slope is still the slope it's still rise over run hey look at that change in y over change in X rise over run only we don't have y as a function of X we don't have X as a function of Y we have them both as functions of theta no problem so we say well let's just do that Dy D Theta DX D Theta Dy D Theta because of our product rule because of our implicitation we get this DX D Theta same thing we get this if we create that ratio that we want Dy D Theta that's our formula for a derivative in with respect to our our polar equations have I explained this well enough for you guys to get it are you sure so I'll just write the last thing out here so Dy DX therefore is this you do Dr r d Theta you multiply by sin Theta you add R cosine Theta over Dr D Theta you get the same thing time cosine th minus r sin thet that is what we work for now again we're working towards finding our tangent lines okay so uh one part of finding tangent lines is being able to be able to find the slope because we know that where we have horizontal tangent lines I'll write this down at the very end we're not actually going to do an example with this but where we have horizontal tangent lines is where the slope is zero or where the numerator would equal zero does that make sense to you where we have vertical tangent lines is where we're undefined where the denominator would equal zero you with me okay so we're going to talk about that in just a little bit but our first step is actually finding the slope so let's go ahead let's do one quick example I'm going to give you a polar equation here r equal that you know what just out of curiosity does anybody remember what that shape is it's cardio that's a cardioid that's right that's the cardioid remember that one the but know I shouldn't have said that it's not the buid yeah it's the cardioid and it's this way it's to the side um 1 plus sin Theta is a cardioid but upward so it's very similar just in a different direction okay so that's a cardioid I want to find the derivative and I want to find the slope of the tangent line at a certain point so here's how it might be worded find dydx and the slope of the tangent line at Theta = 6 okay let's do it if you look back at this check this out look I want to show this to you before we actually get right into our example what you need to know in order to do your derivative is pretty straightforward it says can you find Dr D Theta yes here's R could you take a derivative of this that's Dr D Theta so Dr D Theta is just a derivative of this with respect to Theta you get me so you find that first let's do that first so Dr D Theta equals what's the derivative of one what's the derivative of cosine Theta so the derivative of r with respect to Theta is negativea show feel okay with that so far so here's what's going to happen when we do our ratio we're going to have that thing sin Theta here and we're going to have it here are you with me sin Theta that's not going to change cosine Theta that's not going to change the plus doesn't change the minus doesn't change this cosine doesn't change that sign doesn't change but the r is an issue so the r how much is R do you know how much R is right there you're just going to plug that in so what we do is we plug in we do the this little derivative first it's usually pretty easy do this derivative we're going to put it here over here and here sin Theta cosine theta plus minus cosine Theta sin Theta and then we're going to in input whatever our R is into our formula why don't you guys go ahead and try to do that on your own just create our Dy D Theta right or Dy DX right now I would do on the board we'll see if we come with the same thing put we have over the same thing put our then we do r just testing you now I have a test for you guys for those of you who like to make me want to drink at night uh can I simplify these can I simplify these don't ever freaking do that okay ever ever ever unless your pluses and minuses are in parenthesis you can't simplify anything if they're in parentheses it means you you're multiplying by everything all your factors okay so we can't we can't touch a thing let's see if we got it right uh we have our Dr D Theta here and here we got our sign we got our cosine we got our plus we got our minus we got our R here and here then we got our cosine we got our sign did you get the same thing that I got yes now you could what what is this what do we have right here what does this mean what is it what did you just find the derivative derivative stands for slope that's it that's what it is this represents the slope of that cardio remember the cardioid was the cardioid well this represents a slope of that shape at any point that you give it but our points are now angles so you say at angle of zero what is it well it's probably going to be undefined it's probably going to be a vertical tangent at pi/ 6 what is it I don't know probably going to be negative probably just just a hunts because we go like that cardioid looks like that make sense go at this angle what we can find out what the slope is at any point any angle along that coding that's really actually interesting so don't forget what we're doing we're finding the slope of things that's what a derivative is so since we find dydx all you have to do just plug in five or six now it's probably going to be a little bit nicer if you make if you simplify this a little bit because I don't want to have to plug it in 1 2 3 4 5 six I don't have to plug it in eight times okay so maybe work with it just as a little bit of exercise right now we're going to work through this thing and and simplify this so if we were to do that could you plug it in yes would it be a little bit easier to find horizontal and vertical tangents if you simplified it oh yeah so we're going to have sin^2 th we're going to have plus cosine theta plus cosine 2 thet we're just going to distribute some things we're going to have sin Theta cosine Theta minus sin thetus sin sin Theta cosine Theta can y'all check my algebra too make sure I'm doing that right would you double check me please s squ you distribute Bam Bam we get this distribute get this or multiply distribute we get that with me so far let going start reorganizing some things here because we're going to see some identities pop out of this so first identity that we see what I'm looking for are things like cosine squ plus sin square or cosine squ minus sin squ don't use the wrong identity I'm looking for common terms or like terms you guys okay with that so far yes no yes okay we'll continue does anybody oh man I hope that you know anybody know what cosine squ th minus sin is and don't you dare tell me one cosine 2 that's right that's right this thing right here this piece is cosine 2 I know that's too small to see probably but it's cosine 2 plus cosine th another question can I add cosine 2 th plus cosine thet cosine 3 thet you passed very good you just passed trigonometry okay uh next one how about this how about ignore the negative for a second just look at 2 sin Theta cosine Theta there's another identity right there that's sin 2 right so we're going to have this piece right here sin 2 thetus s so far so good let's do one more thing just to make it a little bit nicer if you want to you can do this let's factor out this negative that way we don't have to worry about subtraction on our denominator here so the way I would probably write this I'd write this as negative cosine 2 thet plus cosine Theta over sin 2 thet plus sin Theta that is our derivative okay I want show show hands if you okay with with that one so far okay now we've answered part of our question so far we've answered this part find dydx we've just found it again I'm going to keep on saying this what is what is this that's the slope what's this what's it the slope of uh to what you're right slope of the tangent line to what to that yeah whatever shape that is that happens to be a cardioid so this says you know what what's also interesting it's the slope based on the angle so that's why I'm giving you I'm not giving you X I'm not giving you y these are polar so it says Hey U tell me what the slope is of your function or the slope of the tangent line to your your function at a certain angle so at Pi 6 so it says okay start at zero go to pi/ 6 tell me what the slope is uh well can you do it M what are you going to do to find out what my slope is plug it in go for it there's four places to plug it in so plug in pi 6 here here here here do not neglect that that is a negative plug in P six here here here here let's figure that out I'm going to expect that you can do it on your own so Dy DX X evaluated ateta = / 6 or in other words M the slope of our tangent line evaluated pi over 6 really did run out of room didn't I sure Ro smaller I'm going to do most of it in my head so if we plug in pi/ 6 here what's 2 * piun 6 what's cosine of pi 3 it's 12 did you did you remember your negative yes 12 plus what's cosine of < / 6 okay keep going U remember we're plugging in pi 6 that's why we're evaluating this plug in what's 2 * 6 what's s of 3 you're going to see why we factor out the negative in just a hot second uh what's s of pi over 6 what is that now you don't need to go further than this and here's why you have 12 plus ro32 you have 2 +2 what is that that's one that's actually it's negative 1 didn't we talk listen didn't we talk about the cardio would shaped like cardio would shaped like this you have this heart shape on its side and we said that at high six so it's kind of like this kind of like that here's zero at pi/ 6 you're about right there what we're finding is a slope at that Point what's the slope going to be should be negative because at Pi 6 our tangent Line's going like that it turns out our slope is negative it's just 1 so what we found and which is really kind of cool we found the slope of a polar equation a polar graph at a certain angle so F if you understand the the concept here it's a really cool idea now I'm just going to wrap this thing up here real quick I'm going to write right down here if you wanted to find horizontal tangents I mentioned it earlier but I'll state it for the record horizontal tangents are going to happen where the top of your derivative your numerator your main numerator where the main numerator of your derivative is equal to zero vertical tangents happen where your derivative is undefined or where the main denominator of your derivative is equal to zero so in other words look it the main numerator is just Dy thet the main denominator is just DX D Theta so if you want to find horizontal tangents what would we set equal to zero yeah we' set the top so for horizontal tangents we just do Dy D Theta equal Z for vertical tangents we do DX D Theta and that's going to give you the angle the angle the Theta at which you are going to have either vertical or horizontal tangents have I explained this well enough for you it it's very similar to parametric if you think back to parametric do you remember that we had dxdt for for vertical we had dydt for horizontal and now our our T is really just a a Theta so far so good okay we just finished section 10 point whatever WR the next thing that we're going to do we're going to talk about using these polar equations in calculus so finding out the are we we kind of did that here but we're going to find out the area under a curve or between of our curve contained within it and that's going to be kind of interesting so we're going to start that right 80 last minute questions on this St okay all that to find one all that to find negative one that's right well that's just like when did all that work to find was Divergent good point like man you show nothing 

Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 10.5:  Calculus of Polar Equations
so calculus of polar [Applause] equations I want to start by looking at how to find the area Bound by a polar curve area bound bipolar curve so let's start with one so here's our polar axis here's our origin and here's the deal we know that our polar curves are given by an angle and that angle dictates what the r is so basically a polar curve can be defined arbitrarily by saying we're going to start at some angle it's called Alpha we're going to end at some angle call it beta and we have some curve R is a function of theta what we're going to try to find here is we're going to try to find the area that's Bound by this polar curve the area would be do you see where the area is going to be it's not going to be this area from the polar axis to here what the area we're looking at is it says well we're starting here aren't we we're going to here the curve is here it's this that's the area that we're looking at that's the area Bound by polar F show P if you understand the the idea of it do do these symbols make sense to you it says that we're going to start at a certain angle Alpha we're going to end like a except it's it's not uh it's not so we're going to say that this is Alpha it's angle we're going to end it another Alpha Beta no problem we're going to go along this curve r r is a function of theta and the area that's Bound by that it's kind of like a cone but it depends on this curve you see you see the cone I'm talking about actually it's more like a sector we're going to talk about that in a second so here it is how we find the area I'm just going to give it to you and you're going to see why it's going to be very straightforward right now here it is now uh these functions are they based on X are they based on y they're based on so when we integrate remember the area is always an integral type of idea so we're going to integral says we're adding up a whole bunch of slices of stuff we're going to talk about what slices we're adding up in just a second I'm not going to prove it for you uh because I think I can just explain it well enough if you remember anything about calculus one when you do integrals uh the Ron sums that you added up they were little slices little rectangles remember that add up an infinite number of them we're going do the same idea that's what integral does it adds stuff so here's what we're going to add we're going to say well where do we want to start if it's not X and Y we got to start at some Alpha so we're going to start here we're going to end at beta and we're going to have here's what we're going to have if you think about this what we're really doing is we're finding the area of a little teeny sector the area of a sector is given by this if you seen that before that's the area of a sector it's 12 R 2 theet you can look it up it's formul I'm not going to go through the proof of that formula all right that's the area of a sector it says take half the radius squared and then multiply by whatever angle you have well here's what we're going to do okay are you listening now R is a function of theta isn't it so for us it says what we're going to do is we're going to take a whole we're going to take a real teeny little sector of this thing a teeny little one and then we're find the next one and the next one and the next one and the next one we're going to allow that distance that angle the distance of the angle between them to go to zero uh and if that's the case we're going to have an infinite number of teeny little sectors that we're going to add up so when we're saying we're starting Alpha you're going to have all these sectors starting at Alpha adding up to Beta and we're going to say all right cool well uh we're going to have the 1/2 we're going to have a function we're going to let R change based on Theta R is a function of theta but then we're going to integrate with respect to to Theta and the reason why we integrate with respect to that variable is because when you integrate that like a DX that's saying that DX the distance between the X values are like infinitesimally small giving you an infinite number of rectangles when you do a basic area for us it says we're going to do D Theta saying that our angle is infinitesimally small we're adding up an infinite number of little sectors we're letting the the angle change little by little by little by little by little so fany you understand the the idea there so where's this coming from chirp chirp little crickets where's that coming from area of a sector you guys see the area of a sector I'm trying to show you here this is the area of a sector you're just allowing the angle to change that's all you're doing here make sense it's cutting this into really little teeny sectors adding up the sectors from alpha to Beta so this is adding up remember the integral it's like an S uh comes from a summation notation so the integral is we're adding up all the Teeny sectors teeny sectors here see it teeny teeny sectors adding from alpha to Beta that's what it means so let's do an example real quick to to illustrate this it's better to know where the formulas came from than to not know so I want to find the area Bound by R2 = 4 cosine 2 th before you say what in the heck is that I need know where to go we've seen this before in fact in the last section we graphed that it didn't look exactly like this it looked like this it looked like Ral Square messed up already it look like this R = 2 cine 2 is that ringing a bell at all yeah that was the last example that we grabed all right so what this graph looks like and you could probably just see it if you thought about here if I plug in zero look at this if I plug in zero it's two * Z okay good and thenine z and then 1 * 4 take square root two our squar so if I if I do angle of zero I got two remember that at all yes and I plugged in uh 2 2 again 2 cos 2 0 * 4 R 2 Ral so we got to here and we we learned about the Symmetry we learned that anything past P or four was undefined you remember that so we said okay well that can happen so what we got really was this this shape that did this well that's pretty good for me make the points bigger appla I know right that's pretty good just don't don't look at that one well here's the deal if we know that's what that looks like and we know about the CM I'm not going to reinvent the wheel okay if you want to figure out how to actually graph that thing well you'd watch the last section okay cuz the we've we've already done this we knew it was symmetric about the polar axis we know it's symmetric about the Theta 2 AIS you with me so let's think about this when we plugged Ina = 0 it gave us 2 when we plugged in Theta = 4 it gave us zero does that make sense so our angle our angles go from Z to Pi 4 and it gives us this little Lo right here gives us that Lo now let's use that to our advantage if we use it to our advantage well let's set this thing up I want to find the area Bound by this curve what that means is all of this stuff do you understand it does it does not look like it from my picture but you get that this and this and this and this are all the same area yes how many pieces are there four so if we integrate from zero where do I want to go zero to where pi over four 4 Moves me from here to here that's where I want to go so if I did 0 power 4 how many pieces is this going to give me from 0 to Pi 4 four no from 0 to Pi 4 it's giving me just this piece what do I have to do to make all of it multiply it by four sure ADV if you understand that that concept are you sure yes no yes okay so we said I know from from probably the previous sections how you'd graph this you know you go back there you figure out how to graph it I did it very fast here uh because for the sake of time we know that at Theta equal 0 I get two so I'm starting here at Theta = pi over 4 I was at zero so from 0 to pi over 4 I get this little load If I multiply 1 2 3 4 just go from 0 to Pi 4 I'm going to have the whole entire area of that shape you get me now use the formula what's our formula to start2 very good and then R now be smart about this look it we already have r s so if this is r s I'm just going to have four cosine 2 th uh see if you're really just paying attention should I square that yes or no no because this is R 2 and then D Theta wrap that thing up with d Theta show guys feel okay with with that one okay let's make this thing what are we going to do probably take the 1/2 out also going to take the four * 12 * 4 is we going to get 8 8 integral 0 to Pi 4 cine 2 oh my gosh have you done stuff like this in this class yeah we covered chapter seven yay you know how to do integrals of trigonometric functions do it what would you use for that is it a hard one no it's an easy one what would you use what would you use substitution good yeah a u substitution is what you would use yeah you do it in fact I'd probably do it in my head because at this point you probably can do that so when I would do this one I'd say okay here's my eight the integral of cosine is s not negative sign verifi that sign of whatever's under my hand divided by the derivative of whatever's under my hand which is just two the two goes on the denom do you understand that a Uub says hey uh take the derivative of that and divide by it that's that's basically what we're doing here what now simp yeah let's simplify okay so we're going to have four S 2 th and now what yeah let's go for go for valuation 0 to 4 can you plug that in hello yes no that should be pretty easy so we're going to have 4 * s of 2 * 4us 4 * S 2 * of 2 * 0 well that should be pretty straightforward uh what's 2 * 4 good what's s of / 2 and 1 * 4 is what's s of zero so this whole thing goes to zero this thing goes to one we get four * 1 well it's really really interesting the area that's Bound by this polar equation this polar curve is equal to does that blow your mind that it's not some random weird decimal that doesn't end that area is four that's crazy what's the area of one of these things one yeah 1 two 3 four that's neat show P if you understand that one okay tell you what let's do one more we need just do as many as we can so area by r = 1 + cine th we've seen that several times now what is that the butt come on I should have said that to you what is that cardid it's cardioid that's right so you said it was facing up cuz it's pluses first I said a heart you said a butt like the butt on the top or on the bottom this is sideways this is the laying down this one is this one the spooning one whatever it was this one mine looks  but it's okay that one okay that's that one I think I threw it backwards a little while ago did I yeah yeah I did draw it backwards oh shame on me darn it oh well do really matter that you uh so that's a cardio that makes a lot more sense for our slope anyway whatever so let's find the area Bound by this cardioid now there's two ways that you can do this firstly do you understand the cardioid is symmetrical so if I make sure I get it right my dyslexia is kicking in if I have that if I have that that point is at Theta equal 0 and this point is at Theta equal Pi Pi that's right so I can do this one of two ways the first way I could set this up up we could set up the integral from we could do it from 0 to 2 pi that would actually work so if you want to go from 0 to 2 pi that's fine let's set up that way first so if I went from 0 to 2 pi that would be the entire region all at once are you listening all at once let's do the uh the formula what would be inside of there okay the 1/2 is there very good and then what 1 where are we getting the 1 plus cosine Theta from R R uhhuh square oh why do we have to square it R is not Square okay very good so this is 12 r squar d thet show F feel okay with with that one now if you work this out you're going to get exactly the same answer as if you were to do this one so let's let's change our our thought process a little bit let's say that I don't want to figure out the whole thing at once I just want to figure out this one do I still go from 0 to 2 pi no no where do I go from and then what do I do multip two ah so that is another option that you could do there there's a couple ways to do this because there's a lot of symmetry involved in these polar equations so fans you can understand that that idea so two different ways does it matter does not matter in this example I would use a symmetry because I like smaller bounds but it does not really matter so let's go ahead and let's go through this um you want to do it this way so maybe you don't have to deal with a fraction 2 * 1 12 no problem so our area is 0 to Pi 2 and 1/2 are gone you're going to have to distribute that so we're going to have 1 + 2 cosine thet plus cosine 2 Theta D Theta can you double check me on that one hey uh could you do the integral of and you understand why we don't have a two or 1/2 anymore right we're just Distributing this don't just square that and square that actually distribute it can you do this integral of one can you do the integral of cosine 2 cosine Theta that's pretty easy can you do the integral of cosine squ Theta oh really what is it they were just on a roll with saying yep yep yep that's it's in the book that's book I guess it's in the book don't just say yep yep I forgot you forgot about your even functions when s and cosine are both even when s and cosine are both even break it up you do this you don't just throw out random guesses you use an identity to say this is 1 12 1 plus cine 2 Theta that should ring a bell to you s Bells be ringing do you remember that at all I hope that you do if you don't you might want to refresh your memory on some of this stuff because hey you're going to be us this before you start integrating do yourself a favor and just combine some like terms okay so I will integrate my one and my 1/2 just make that three Hales and then integrate it so we're going to go 0 to Pi we're going to have 3es plus 2 cosine Theta + 12 cosine 2 thet d does that look better let's see if we can do all the integrals now okay and don't just say yep uh can you do the integral of three Hales yep uh how about the integral of 2 cosine Theta and this one yeah we actually just did that it's a little substitution we'll do it in our head so go for it let's see if you guys can do okay [Applause] I got a three half Theta did you get a three half Theta those constants don't just go away uh I got a two sin Theta did you get a two sin Theta no negatives I got a one okay I got a 1 half but then this right here that's sin 2 Theta over two because of our U substitution we divide by the derivative of this little piece that's going to give my4 show fans feel okay with that so far okay we're good what do we do now down y let's evaluate where we going to go from Z okay so if we go from zero to Pi that says we're going to do which one do we do first again so 3 piun + 2 * s of piun + 1/4 * s of 2 piun minus well you know what I'm going to cheat a little bit not cheat but let's look at it if we plug in zero that's going to be what Z that's going to be this whole thing is going to be this is all zero are you with me on that one now if this was cosine would I want to do that no no because you're going to get ones out of those okay so this is big Z now let's do it uh how much is s of Pi come on quickly s of Pi zero how about s of 2 pi zero wow that was a lot of zeros what do we get that's it our area is 3i / 2 so when someone asks you do you have a large heart you say no really uh my heart is only an area of 3i / 2 it's a finite number that was really dumb anyway so uh the area of our card by the way do I have to multiply that by two since I yeah okay we already did that so we took care of it whatever way you work it I did it the other way too if you don't if you go from zero to 2 pi works out the same you're going to get 3 pi over two show pant if that one made sense to you cool all right we got a couple more examples uh we'll probably take care of them just next time okay so so the back end of our section here almost done what we've done with on last time was we found out how to find the area that's Bound by a polar curve do you guys remember that from from yesterday well the way we did it was we said all right what we're going to do is we're going to take the area of a little sector and we're going to integrate that we're going to allow that sector to uh have an infinite number of teeny little pieces which we're going to add together and that that came up with the area of our of our are well the area of our our polar curve area Bound by our polar curve now what we're going to do is just extend that concept a little bit we're going to find the area Bound by two polar curves so let's suppose that we got two polar curves we got R1 = F of theta and we have R2 = G of Thea so just two simple polar curves and we're going to integrate these on a certain interval if you remember anything about calculus one this is very similar to finding the area between two curves you remember finding the area between two curves do you at all it was an integral right it goes from A to B and it just said top curve minus bottom curve that's that's all it was area under the big curve minus area under the little curve well that's what this is going to look like except think about this for a second the area Bound by a polar curve looks a whole lot like the area of a sector because the area of a sector is what we're integrating and so this is going to be big curve minus little curve but it's also going to fit our idea of area of a of a uh bound bipolar curve like like a sector so let me show you what this is so suppose we have two curves F of theta and G of theta those our two polar curves and suppose that we know the intersection of them or we just going from two angles uh Alpha to Beta then the area between these two curves is going to look like this uh Let me refresh your memory here real quick area under or area Bound by one curve would do this it would do alpha to Beta it would have 12 R 2 and then we have D Theta does that look from the don't write that down you already have it okay does that look familiar to you do you remember this this was look at this this is area of a sector as we're letting the angle change we're adding up all little sectors so adding up all the sectors as our as our angles change and or with little teeny teeny angles show F if you feel okay with with that one now if we have two of these then here's what we're going to do basically we would say all right well you know what we do we'd have don't I'm going to kind of work with this for a little I'll kind of semi proove this all right what we would do is say hey here here's um here would be the the big area so if we want to find the area of this just the area Bound by this one we'd go from alpha to Beta 12 of R1 2 D Theta we we'd find that integral does that make sense if we want to find it between a big polar equation and a small polar curve then we would do what remember this find the area between these two curves what do you do so if that's x-axis find the area between those two curves what do you do little one from big one little one from subtract little from a big one so we' find all of this and we' subtract that remember that well we're going to do the same thing here we'll find all the area of the big one and we would subtract the area of the small one I'm going to work with this for just a little bit so you can see where this is coming from we'd subtract on the same bounds of integration the area of the small one does that make sense hello yes no okay so if we put them together because they have the same bounds we end up getting Alpha the beta 12 I can even Factor the 1/2 R1 2us R2 2 D Theta can you make make it there algebraically just factoring the one2 we're grouping these two things together well let's go one step further the one step further says is that R1 is actually equal to some function in terms of theta so instead of R1 we could write okay let's try this again that was weird let's try this again instead of R1 R1 is actually equal a function of theta so instead of writing R1 we could write F that's right instead of writing R2 we could write that's exactly what we're going to do and this is the formula that you guys are going to find so we'd say Alpha the beta we'd have the one half we would just have F of theta sarus G OFA squ D Theta that's the whole idea this is what we're working with right now should P be located with with that so far do you guys see what it's doing do you see how it's taking the area of the big sector minus the area of the little sector do you see what it's doing just saying hey big one minus little one that that's it that's going to give us the area between these two polar curves you guys want to try an example real quick to see what this is all about yeah okay so let's do that so I want the area between R 3 and R = 2 + 2 cosine thet find the area between R = 3 and R = 2 + 2 cosine you know what I'll show you how to do every bit of this um but we might want to think about what this even looks like before we get started on this so firstly do I have two polar curves what do you think yeah is that a polar curve for sure can you think about what that looks like if you can't do a little manipulation with this so might want to think of this as R = 2 * 1 + cosine thet hey look at that what's R equals y'all should know what's r = 1 + cine Theta cardid the cardioid what's two times that just a bigger cardioid a bigger a larger heart now is this the one that's like this or the one that's like this on it side yeah that's on its side that's right that's the spooning cardioid is what we like to say well what I like to say it's just funny um anyway so this is a bigger butt this we like big butts and Cann I've been working on that that one for a while these other brothers they can't deny when a cardioid walks in matter okay so that's a cardioid it's on a side just a little bigger now what's Ral 3 is there a Theta there no now think about this this says Ral 3 no matter what the Theta is R is a constant R does not change what do a curve look like when it has an r that doesn't change no matter what the Theta is cirle not a line a circle it's a circle can you imagine something that just has a radius of three uh what is it it's a circle so what this says is that our curve looks something like this we have 1 2 3 and four our Circle would have a radius of three so notice this this is what it's saying it says that if you allow the angle to change and the r doesn't change it says Hey R is always three R is always three r r is always it's going to be a circle one two three two three two three so our Circle would look like oh man I hope I get this right oh it's okay like that so F feel okay that rals 3 equals that circle now how about the next one check this out R equals this cardioid this bigger cardioid now here's what cardioids normally do look up here at the board please typically this cardioid would have a point at zero and would have a point at two do you remember that it would look like this well if you take all those values those R values and you multiply them by two it just doubles that so instead of having Z oh well we still have zero don't we because 0 * 2 is still zero so we're going to be Crossing at the the uh the pole at the origin but if we normally went to two now we're going to be going to very good so our cardioid is going to be outside and inside of our Circle so here's how it's going to look cardio cardioid looks something I'm going draw a purple so you can see the difference looks something like this says normal cardioid hey goes like this so bad at this normal cardioid that an enlarged heart would do this would say now we're taking all those RS and we're multiplying it by two so every distance is going to get a little bit further from the radius it's going to all those RS are going to double does that make sense to you all the RS double looks something like this okay I'm a you know what I'm a little off my heart's got a bad heart about like that off okay let's kind of just assume all right it wish I wasn't a perfectionist just leave it's [Music] called okay obviously I'm not a good artist okay my bad do you get the do you get the picture no pun intended but do you get the picture of the idea here so Ral 3 Circle radius of three uh Ral 2 plus 2 cosine Theta it's a cardioid it's just a bigger cardioid do you see that these curvs are going to intersect so what we're looking for is the area Bound by these curves the area Bound by these Curves in this instance that I want to look for is this I'll look for that now these things intersect the intersect here and here at those two points we need to find out what these are here's why we need to find them think carefully on this stuff look at this look it look it look it notice that our equation here deals in angles do you get it doesn't deal in X and Y it says I need your starting angle I need your ending angle we need to find out the angle where these things intersect and angle where they stop intersecting where the intersection stops show hands if you understand that that concept here so in order to do that how how would we do it how do you ever find the intersection of two curves what do you do subract NOP how do you fine NOP usually in Calculus if you don't know the answer say take a derivative and you're right and this class says take an integral but no not this time uh this goes back to algebra actually how do you find the intersection of two curves people you need to know how to find where two lines cross them make them equal to each other there look it hey if Ral 3 and Ral 2 plus 2 cosine could you make them equal to each other hey that's going to give you where they intersect they always it always happens where if you set two curves equal to each other you're going to find out where they're equal where they cross where the intersection is quick head now if you understand that concept it goes back to algebra if you ever want to find out where two curves intersect set them equal so we're going to set them equal to each other to find out what these intersections are so setting them equal 3 = 2 + 2 cosine so far so good solve it how we going to solve that probably good idea so we have subtracting 2 oneals 2 cosine Theta divide by two so I'm going to flip the sides cosine Theta equal 12 now stop and look at your picture this is why we usually like to have pictures here think about where cosine thet = 1/2 if you know anything about trigonometry you know that cosine equal 1 positive 1/2 in quadrants 1 all students take calculus quadrants one but not two and three and then quadrant four does that make sense that's where cosine equal positive2 what is cosine Thal pos2 for Quadrant 1 what's for Quadrant 1 very good I had to think for a second but yes how about cosine Theta equal 12 for Quadrant 4 5 3 that's right now I need to clear something up for you right now please listen please listen we need this area right here are you with me so what I need to do is I need to go from here to here we're going to be going in the positive direction for angle change well the problem is is if this is 5i 3 and this is pi 3 can I possibly go from 5 3 and go positive and end up at Pi pi over 3 no that's a bigger angle that's a problem now if I switch around and I go pi over 3 to 5 pi over 3 remember that this is going to go positively in the positive direction so if I set up my integral from 5 piun 3 to Pi three I have a problem because I can't go from Big angles to small angles and still be positive does that make sense sense if I go backwards and do 5K 3 over sorry 3 to 5 3 it's not doing this it would actually be doing this you'd find this area does that make sense to you that's also another problem unless we're looking for it okay what we want to do is we want to start here and go here but still gain angle so still go in the positive direction so instead of 5 Pi 3 what could I call that call it negative 3 that way start here that's still negative 3 right it's co- terminal with this so 3 I'm going to go positive to Pi 3 that makes sense and I'm also going for only this range only that angular range show hands if you understand that concept so you have to think about this you have think about what your quadrants are and what your picture really looks like that's what we talked about graphing all these these pictures so we're not going to use 5 3 we're going to use negative pi 3 because that will give me this did I explain that one if you understand it why we're not going from 5 Pi 3 to Pi 3 firstly because we can't because that doesn't make sense uh do you understand why we're not going from pi over 3 to 5 Pi three CU that's this way that's this that's that's not this area this is the area we're looking for so let's go ahead let's set this thing up and then we'll work on the integral together okay so uh our area we're ready to go where's our integral going to start please very good where's the integral going to stop what am I going to have here okay that's our formula 12 one I just like threes you know 12 what's going to go first what's going to go first now what's going to go first is think about this when I gave you the curves over here you took big curve minus little curve big here means the one furthest away from the origin so big curve minus little what's the outside one is it the three or is the 2 plus 2 cosine Theta 2 + 2 that's the outside one so we're going to have 2 + 2 cosine Theta keep going come on help me out square oh the whole thing gets squared that's going to be yummy and then what minus what perfect because that's the inside one in this case okay let's double check uh do you understand why we're going from PI 3 to pi over 3 yes no see where the 1/2 comes from it's our formula it's area of a sector we're just taking big sector the most outside minus little sector the one most inside and then we're integrating D Theta show feel okay now let's work on this one what's the first thing we're going to do in fact if there's no questions I'd like to move over here do you guys have any questions on this okay so I want lots of space okay tell me what what are we going to do go from 0 to 3 and just get the2 oh that's a good idea why is that a good idea so we could do this couldn't we is this symmetrical we know circles are symmetrical we also know cardioids are symmetrical about the polar axis so that means that our area is also symmetrical so if I wanted to man that one half' be kind of nice instead of going from negative pi 3 to Pi 3 let's go from 0 to pi over 3 do you guys want to do that let's do that if if we go from 0 to pi over 3 then we still have 12 and we still have all this stuff I'm actually going to distribute this right now so we have four plus how much cosine S no well that's going to be up there yeah but what's the next thing let's try Distributing this correctly okay we have four then we have how much no 8 cos uh do youall see where the 8 cosine Theta is coming from if you distribute it's this times itself so we get four then we got two and four and four that's 8 cosine Theta then we have our 4 cosine Theta if you don't know how to distribute these quickly you just Square this multiply this multiply by two and then square that so you're going to have 4 cosine squ and then we're going to have Min - 9 and then we're going to have a d Theta now we talked about something here real quick you guys okay um since since we changed bounds wouldn't the one half disappear we're talking about that right now actually so I I want to make sure you guys are clear on exactly what's happened before we go any further do you understand where all this stuff came from right here we're Distributing this we're just squaring our N9 now what we did we changed our balance we're not going from piun 3 to Pi 3 anymore we're going from 0 to pi over 3 if we're going from 0 to pi over 3 that's only giving us half of the eror we want how do I make this thing fit that M that's right so what this is representing right now the way it is it's representing this area if I want all the area I just times it by two because it's symmetrical does that make sense okay now let's start working on this thing couple things we can do what's going to happen two that's kind of one one of the reasons why we did this because firstly zero is nice to plug in rather than negative power 3 so when we get to the very end I don't want have to do that so zero is nice also it's getting rid of all of our constants uh that we have outside of our integral so we got 2 * 1/2 gone also maybe we combine some like terms here so we got area equals 0 to pi over 3 in our integral we're going to have four actually we're not what are we going to have not five plus 8 cosine Theta + 4 cosine 2 thet and then D Theta of all that stuff easy medium hard what do you think doable yes have you seen this before oh yeah can you integrate that piece of K can you integrate this piece of K can you integrate this yes right now the way it is no can you change it yes yes oh you guys are the yes crowd I forgot about that no or yep yep uh yep yep yep no 12 1 + cosine 2 Theta D Theta yeah we're going to use that identity so this says well keep the four this is 1 12 * 1 + cosine 2 theet what's nice for us we got even numbers so 4 * 1/2 is 2 we go all right cool we got 0 to piun 3 we got -5 + 8 cine Theta + 2 if this whole thing is two then I have two plus 2 cosine 2 thet I know I'm doing a couple steps at once I'm simplifying and I'm Distributing are you guys okay with it okay why don't you go ahead and see if you can do the the integ actually you know what we might want to do one more thing what's the last thing we might want to do com probably combine these guys so let's do that and then I want you to integrate it did you integrate it yes how many people did it integrate you got it how many people did I'll give you some more time I want you all to integrate this it shouldn't take you long I don't care if you evaluate it I want you to just integrate it just get the integral done uh we'll evaluate this together in just a minute so as long as you get the integral done that's what I care about have you got the integral Done Yet guys over here yes no okay so if we integrate here we're going to have remember it's D Theta so we're going to have -3 Theta we're going to have Plus 8 s Theta we're gonna have plus cosine sorry plus uh S 2 th actually what you get is 2 sin 2 th over 2 you get 2 sin 2 th divide by the derivative here but your twos are going to be gone so depends if you made it that far on your own that's great that's fantastic so I'm going to raise my twos now what say what way where does it start it's kind of nice to have a zero isn't it so we don't have to plug in all those NE pi over 3 to all the stuff because that would be kind of that'd be nasty and we could do it it'd be the same answer but we don't have to now which one do we plug in first so we're going to plug that in we're going to get netive 3 * 3 + 8 sin 3 plus S 2 pi 3 minus now let's check this okay don't make the mistake of just leaving this hanging out okay a lot of people especially students who are just coming through this the first time or something uh when they see Zero they go oh it's always going to be zero that's not true if you had coine here it's definitely not going to be zero now 3 * 0 okay s of0 okay s of0 okay so all the rest of is going to be zero but you do need to check this does that make sense so this is all zero yes so minus 0 gives us well let's think about that uh what's -3 * 3 Pi okay how about s of pi over 3 do you know what s of pi over 3 is32 so we have Plus 8 < TK 3/ 2 we'll simplify that in a minute and then s of 2 piun 3 what's s of 2 piun 3 that's right quick your hands feel okay with that so far now you can choose to do a couple things but I probably wouldn't do this I wouldn't simplify this right now because right now we have a common denominator and we also have a common root so if I have 8 < tk3 2 + < tk3 over2 that's 9 < tk3 /2 does that make sense so our area = 9 < tk3 / [Applause] 2- not a nice looking area but we found it that's kind of cool so the area between a large heart a large cardioid and a circle this particular circle is 932 minus Pi could you find an approxim for that if I asked you to that's the whole idea show be with this one all right tell you what the last thing that we're going to do in here I'm going to give you some formulas on how to find Arc Length on how to find area of a surface revolutions going be really similative stuff you've done before not going to give you examples on that there's formulas that you will know how to plug stuff in for okay you know how to do integrals right you know how to plug stuff in right so it's it's going to be just formulaic at this point after that I'll show you how to find the intersection between two polar curves which is very useful like this sort of stuff uh and we'll talk about some interesting things that can happen so uh just a couple formulas at first but do you have any questions on this before I continue have I explained this well enough for you guys to to get it okay so few other calculus Concepts dealing with polar equations and the first one is Ark length to find the length of a polar curve you can use this formula AR length is the integral Alpha Beta those are our angles square root so far does that look familiar the square root do you remember anytime we ever found length of a curve we've always had a square root in calculus one it looks like this it's 1 + frime of X2 under that square root you remember that how it looks for uh for parametric it was DX dt^ 2 + Dy dt^ s remember that for us it's going to be similar to this one what we do is we take a square root and we do Dr D Theta squared so far it looks ex very very similar to uh a parametric and then we do just R 2 that's where it changes just a little bit because our R is a function of theta we have a little bit different of an idea than than parametric but that's the idea of Arc Length feel okay with could you if I asked you to find the length of a curve between two two angles sure what are you going to do well the first thing you're going to do is take like for not that one okay that's that's pretty easy uh but like that one first thing you do is do what take a derivative with respect to Theta then Square it not a problem that'd be pretty easy to do wouldn't it so take a derivative Square it then do you know how much R is yeah sure you do take the r plug it in square it combine your like terms figure out how to do the integral it's under square root so you might have to use some manipulation there but that's the idea feel okay with the idea not a problem all right so how about area of a surface of revolution we'll talk about the polar axis and then about th = Pi / 2 a or what pi 2 y uh which one do we usually call the polar axis what is that X or the Y yeah it's like the x axis and the pi/ two that's like our y now of course we don't really have those in polar equations but we can think of them like that for this instance because I I want you to want you to really consider where we get these um where we got all of our surface of of Revolution surface area Revolution we got this we said okay if I'm going about if I'm going about the x-axis of some curve well whatever my curve is I'm going to need to know the height of it because What's Happening Here is if you remember how this was and if you if you don't you can watch calculus one i' explain how to do all of this at length and prove all of it what happens is we take we take little circles right and we find the circumference of each circle if we find the circumference of each circle and integrated about the length of the curve so you say hey here what's the circumference here then add it up then add it up then add it up then add it up then add it up add and we do that while we integrate across the length of this whole curve then what we end up getting is a whole bunch of circumferences added together gives us our surface area now of course the circumference is multiplied by a little infinitesimal width which is how we actually get to add them up okay we that's our integration idea invols a limit but this is the plan the plan is do circumference times length and then integrate that's the whole idea circumference what's the circumference of a circle oh good what is it no it involves a pi and an R it's not squared that would be if you square a unit do you understand you're going to get an area out of that I'm looking for circumference 2 pi r 2 pi r it's 2 pi r so what I'm trying to do here is take the circumference times the length listen do we already have an expression for the length yes yes that's the length so all we're going to have to do about the xaxis to say okay well here's Alpha here's beta I'm going to going to do circumference time length the length is going to be taken care of for us already the length is this it's Dr D Theta 2+ R 2 and then of course we're going to do D Theta you guys all understand that's length right so all I want is circumference times length because I'm just adding up all the little circumferences times a little bit of little bit of width giving us a surface area of each little little kind of it's it's almost like a miniature cylinder and we allow that cylinder to change shapes so it's 2 pi r okay 2 well wait a minute 2 pi r 2 pi well we don't really want R we let's not let our RS get confused here R for Polar R for polar equations stands for this this distance here what we want is the r the radius of our little circles what is this if I have it X Y AIS what's the radius of our Circle it's y it's y only in terms of us remember back at the very beginning of polar equations uh we had two definitions we said X was equal to R cosine thet and Y wasal to R sin thet remember that so instead of Y what am I going to put here R yeah also I'm going to move this 2 pi out front I'll write better now I'm not going to give you an example about how to do this I'm hoping that you can figure out that it's a formula so let's let's look at this for a second you already told me that you guys could find length right yes so if I ask you find the surface area Revolution about the polar axis the xais think about what this means all I want to do is find the circumference times the length do you guys see that this is circumference times length here look at this Here's 2 pi r well the r in that the r is the y height because if I'm going around the x- axis the height of my circle the radius of my circle is just my y my y component Y is R sin Theta so we have 2 2 pi radius the radius is R sin thet because that is the height of my y quick head now if you understand that's the most tricky part here do you guys get that part so circumference 2 pi radius y r times length hey length and then we integrate that now can you tell me what the only difference between this and this is going to be what do you think R say what now R that's right why I mean because why that's confusing yeah that's right so if I was going around the Y AIS this way so around the Y AIS then my radius is going to be the X component since X is R cosine Theta we have 2 pi radius or x cosine Theta and then we have because it's polar and X and Y don't exist in polar right would it still you take your X component and your y component and say well you know what if I'm trying to figure out how what my radius is so a polar curve would look H you know what do here polar curve even if I have just like this just an arc if I want to revolve that I need an X component and a y component depend on where they're going around the x axis or Y AIS so if I said all right I want to revolve that just something simple like that one if I want to revolve that this way I need to find out the radius of the circle it's going to make so this is going to make some sort of a circle right right where I want to find out my radius the radius is just the Y component so what we need to do is basically convert a polar equation into well kind of think it through think instead of polar let's think XY because I'm going around kind of the x axis the polar axis I just want my component my y component because my y component is my height so if my y = r sin Theta then I have 2 pi radius it's 2 pi y y is my radius but I need it also in the form of a polar equation that's where I get our R sin Theta from and in the X in the uh around the Y AIS it's X instead of Y and so we get our our cosine Theta the length length is easy length is what we had before so it's circumference times length that's basically the idea in a nutshell I mean I would like to prove it but I obviously don't have time and I've proved it before this idea before in calculus one so you can always go back and watch that show you understand the concept of this one so if I had you do this could you plug in the appropriate things yeah we we could find R not a problem take your R multiply by sin Theta take Dr D Theta no problem it's just your length so Dr D Theta squar R squ and then might be a nasty but you you do know how to do those things now I want to cover one unless there's any other questions anymore at all with this you sure okay one more I want to show you this example because interesting things happen when you try to find the intersection between two polar curves I'll show you that right now so what we're going to do is we're going to find out without having to graph this where these things intersect so Ral cosine Theta R = cosine 2 Theta where are these going to intersect I don't know what these things look like or at least let's pretend I don't know what these things look like let's try to find out the intersection Now ladies and gentlemen I ask you this already today how do you find out where any two curves intersect provided their solve for your variable your dependent variable R provided it's not like an r s or something yes just set them equal so Ral cosine thet and Ral cosine 2 Theta if I want to find out where they intersect I just set them equal and I try to solve for Theta are you listening still okay so let's do that let's set them equal to try to find intersection now where in the world is cosine Theta going to equal cosine 2 Theta without having to think a whole whole bunch of stuff here well um and we're going to come back to this in in about 3 4 minutes too but hav do that let's use some identities and maybe come up with an equation that we can use the one thing I don't like I don't like how that's Theta and that's 2 Theta because that's causing my brain some trouble right now so let's change this one so I'm going to do cosine Theta and I'm going to use that formula that we often use in but we're going to use in Reverse remember how cosine squar = 1 cos 2 well what that means is that we can do that in Reverse so let's see = 1 + cosine 2 if we solve that for cosine 2 th then we get uh 2 cosine 2 - 1 = cosine 2 th does that make sense to you we just solve that we use that in Reverse so this therefore equals cosine 2 * cos 1 now if you don't see it I don't blame you but do you see do you see this is kind of cool um this is actually a quadratic equation do you see it we get something squared we get the same something not being squared why we didn't we wanted to stay away from signs and stuff we want to make them all cosin because right now if I solve this for zero on one side I can get that now what's interesting is this is still factorable just like anything else it'd be like doing 0 = 2x 2 - x -1 in fact you could do that just call that X for now Factor it put your cosine back in So if you factor not cuz I just got in the habit of it um uh 2x what is it 2x do you know it pretty sure it's that but you double that would give us 2x^2 - 2x + x that's - x and then - one can you verify that that's the correct one okay well now that we have cosin instead of x's we get 0 = 2 cosine th + 1 * cosine th - 1 just from our basic Factory now what's interesting is that the zero product property that always works for us so if we have a product and we have that product equal to zero what that says is that each of those factors has to equal zero let's deal with this one first cuz it's going to be a little bit easier for us all right let's solve that how would I solve it cosine Theta equal one now this one's easy okay cosine theta equals one you tell me right now if cosine theta equals 1 how much is Theta Z very good zero you with me okay now now think about this for two look back up our original equation do you remember we want points right we want intersection points intersection points look like this they look like R thetas you get me we now have a Theta we need an R this is going to be easy one but do you understand that we're not done right here we just have this is like saying hey find out where the uh the lines intersect and you say they intersect at xal 3 does that give me a point no it tells me somewhere in Infinity at xal 3 they're going to intersect I don't want that I want to know the angle and how far out to go I don't want hey the intersect at the equal zero cool where that that doesn't help me at all I want to know where I want a point you get the point okay so zero now look at this if r equal cosine thet look down here how much does cosine thet equal how much does r equal then equal 1 therefore r equal 1 so from here here r = 1 we now have a point we have a point which one comes first the r or the Theta R so 1 Z these are going to intersect at the polar coordinate of one and one and zero an R of one and angle of zero so it says hey uh angle zero go out one these things are going to intersect right there so you understand that one okay now let's let's work on this one real quick uh do you understand that here we're going to have cosine Theta = 1/2 yes no okay cosine equal 12 cosine is negative in quadrants two and three very good so cosin's 12 where Pi 3 so if it's a pi over 3 for 1/2 it's going to be 2 piun over 3 for2 and 4K 3 for2 so these thetas are 2i 3 you can check your unit circle if you want and 4 3 so Pence you okay with that one are you sure now is my R going to be one for these points as well what's my R look up here what's my R you got it cosine thet equal R yeah so if cosine Thal -12 that means R = 12 and so we we get two points here but they're both going to have the same R we get - 12 2i 3 and we get - 12 4 Pi be a weird what I want to know is does that make sense to you show hands if it does you're like okay that that makes sense these are weird yeah because you have to go 2 pi over 3 but then go negative one2 all right so it's in quadrant four uh and this this one says you go 4 piun 3 can't even do that and that's negative so it's in quadrant one actually but that's what those intersections are that's this is right on the Polar axis do you guys feel okay with that one so find use an identity find an equation solve it then just don't forget that you need to find your R you don't just give me Theta is here Theta is zero sure but R is one so 1 zero uh f is 2 pi 3 and 4 Pi 3 but that also both work with the r cos is R of2 so we have2 2K 32 4K 3 now the last bit this is this was not that interesting this is what makes it interesting you ready plug in cosine of Pi / 2 what's cosine of Pi / 2 zero what's cosine of 3 pi/ 2 good I almost go to sleep for a little bit okay good all right um do do PI four so that was for this one do you understand that you are going to have an R of zero do do you get that point yes so if I plug in so this is kind of a the this is the interesting part so if I do theta = / 2 or 3 Pi 2 I get zero with me that means I'm going through the pole I'm going through the origin you follow do this plug in pi 4 here it's 2 * pi 4 what's our R weird okay plug in 3 Pi 4 3K 4 * 2 is 3K 2 what's cosine 3K 2 I get zero here did we have an intersection of Ral 0 anywhere up here no no they said Ral 1 they said ral2 yet we know for sure that both of these curves are going to go through the origin at some point do you get that why it doesn't show up is because they go through the origin at different times so what's weird about these polar curves is that even if you solve it all the way down we don't make any mistakes here you can still go through the same point but at different times so the angles aren't the same when they hit that point cuz here we're multiply those * 2 that's what's weird so we do have another intersection so one more intersection intersection happens at2 2K 3 intersection happens at-2 4K 3 intersection happens at 1 0 intersection also happens at R = 0 because they're both going through the origin right there isn't that interesting that's kind of cool right weird just different times so F if everything made sense up until this last little part did this last little part make sense did it blow your mind it should blow your mind a little bit like w that's weird because almost like parametric it's it's just happening at a different time it's reaching that point at a different angle anyway that is it for this section 

Transcript for: Numerical Integration With Trapezoidal and Simpson's Rule
okay for us our very last section talking about numerical integration kind of going back in time to our calculus 1 days or first semester calculus here's what numerical integration is all about what it allows you to do is approximate integrals definite integrals that you couldn't otherwise do that we don't have a formula for that man we I don't know how to do this one or something we haven't covered because there are going to be some integrals that we have not covered even though we've done all our techniques integration there's somebody looking up I don't know as a possible action no it's a trick I don't know well we can approximate those definite integrals with these two processes one's called the trapezoidal rule and one code is called Simpsons rule so we're going to talk about trapezoidal rule first then Simpsons rule they're very similar and what you do what this is doing again it's giving you an approximation of a definite integral without having to even do the integral you with me okay so like I said I think I just mentioned this to you guys but put yourself back into your first semester calculus days when we haven't done a lot of integrals okay so the ones we're going to do on the board they would be something you learn in calculus two what we've all we've already learned them but back then these integrals would have not been really possible for us because we would not have learned them yet you with me okay so with that in mind let me introduce you the trapezoidal rule so the trapezoidal rule says this if you want to approximate a definite integral remember the definite integrals have bounds of integration they go from like an e to e they go somewhere of any function that you want we can approximate it hits our squiggly equals here we could we can approximate it by doing this and really interesting here's how it works it says I don't define these in just a minute but they should look familiar if you took calculus 1 this looks familiar Delta X you guys have seen Delta X before Epogen will talk without the finance second if you don't remember what it is you take Delta X u divided by 2 and you multiply it by this sum by f of X sub 0 plus 2 times f of X sub 1 plus 2 times f of X sub 2 plus and you keep all those twos and tell you get down to 2 times f of X sub n minus 1 plus f of X sub n no - that's the trapezoidal rule now I'm going to define a couple of these things for you personally what Delta X is if you don't remember it's okay Delta X is B minus a where do I get my B minus a from do you know that's a certain iman say it's just your your integral so B minus a divided by N and it's going to be given to you so n is going to be some finite number because we're approximate right now now listen we can't let n go to infinity because if we did well we wouldn't have an approximation anymore and this is going to we would have a finite number of terms add up and one via approximation we can't actually do that we couldn't do this forever the idea of doing this forever is the actual integrals add so because do the integral well then we're left with a finite number of terms to approximate our value and then X sub I which means that X sub 0 X sub 1 X sub 2 X sub 3 X + 4 X sub n minus 1 X sub n it's given by this you start with Eddie again a is just right here and you add to it your index times Delta X that might look a little confusing you get a treasure on this this is not that hard to do I'm going to prove that to you right now with an example so write down the formula I'm going to show you how to do it just make sure you write down correctly okay there's no two in front of this there's a 2 in front of every other term that you have until you get to the very very last one and then there's not a 2 there quick hit up you're ok with that so far okay so let's do our example so what we're going to do is we're going to approximate 1/2 - 1 over X DX and what we want to do is approximate this with N equals 10 if N equals 10 what that's going to mean for us is that we're going to get 11 terms here we have an X sub 0 through X sub 10 we're going to end on the X sub 10 term does that make sense to you so we need eleven terms stop it N equals 10 now if you look at that many of you're going to think well I'll just do the integral what's the integral of 1 over X would you know that in a late transcendentals class like we have for calculus 1 as I kept this one we don't cover that so that's why I said put yourself back into calculus want first semester calculus class at our College we have what's called late transcendental some people have early where they do this in calculus 1 we don't so we do it later so for us this would have been impossible back in calculus 1 so all we would have done is try to approximated here's how we're approximated the first thing we do we'll figure out Delta X of course that's going to be important for us so to figure out Delta X Delta X is B minus a over N all those things are going to be given to you if you have a definite in a roll what's our beat - over and perfect that's going to be 110 okay what we're close to place and putting this in our formula now we got to figure out our X sub 0 or X sub 1 X sub 2 - X sub 3 and X sub 4 blah blah blah in fact you can think of this is because I'm going to be some calculators you can think about this is 0.1 if you want to you might make things a little bit easier for you if you want so it looks kind of weird like how am I going to figure it's not that hard here's what it says if I want X sub 0 X sub 0 says start at a would say add 0 D X's so we're just going to have one does that make sense exit sorry X 1 1 missed one exit 1 says this started a what's what's a 1 and add 1 Delta at one time is Delta X so it'd be one plus point 1 or just 1 point 1 X sub 2 says start a it's 1 plus 2 times Delta X well that would be 1 plus 0.2 1.2 can you tell me what the next one's going to be going through what's the next one and then 1.5 and 1.6 then 1.7 1.8 and 1.9 at the very end we're going to get to X sub 9 that's going to be one point and then X sub 10 gives you I wish so hands feel okay with where those are coming from can you follow that should be a little easier because it's back to factor this one stuff it just plug in numbers in it just says hey start here start whatever that is and just add Delta X so for X sub 0 yet none of them so just one and then add this one point one add it again one point two add it again 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 and then to one point n - yeah so we get to now what the trapezoidal rule says is after you've all if you've done all that the integral can be approximated by doing this you take Delta X what's our Delta X so we have Delta x over 2 and then you're going to do this you're going to have f of X sub 0 F of what plus what's the next thing I'm going to right now our to store two times F of what yeah plus 2 times 1 point 2 plus 2 times F of 1 point 3 plus the reviews all the way down till we get to 2 times F of 1 point 9 and then we're going to have do we have a two on the very last term no oh just F of 2 okay I want to do like a 20-second recap just to make sure that you give this so the idea behind these numerical integrations is sometimes we can't integrate or sometimes we don't know how to integrate it and this would be one of those cases where at the time we would not have known how to do this now I'm giving you a very simple example okay just so it makes our math easy so you get the idea you could do this with some pretty hardcore integration I know that you don't know how to integrate if it's a definite integral to understand that if it's not a definite integral this this doesn't work because I'm plugging numbers in alright so we say is all right now where's your integral starting whatever where it is stopping whatever you can find Delta X with that provided you're given the number of iterations and your your your rule so in this case we have N equals 10 that's 11 terms that we're going to be going through so it says okay cool well if that's my Delta X then I start with my a I just add my Delta X for every new term so I added them add it than that until I get up in my last one plug in the formula we have Delta x over 2 no problem f of X of 0 f of X sub 1 so 1 1 will point you all the way to the very end notice though into two terms that don't have two s on the first one and the last one you follow now what's nice about this do you have a function that you can plug these things into yeah that's right there it's just 1 over X so we're going to do this we're going to start by taking our Delta X it's 0.1 divided by 2 and then we're going to have F of 1 so that's 1 over 1 plus 2 times F of 2 so check it out it's going to be 2 times 1 over 1 point 1 plus two times one over one point two plus two times one over one point three plus we do this for a while for a finite number of terms and we're going to end off with two times one over one point nine plus one over two I want you to see if you can you can go through that you mine data that actually makes sense to you so fans if that does make sense to you okay so here's what you're going to do on your calculators what you're going to do is you're going to figure out what all these things are I'm not writing all because it takes too long so but I'm hoping that I've made this clear on what this this is you guys see what what it is we're starting with just a function evaluated at whatever RNA is just one and then we add to 2 times F at one point 1/2 times F at 1 point 2 2 times F of whatever our exit 3 exit for X upon all the way up till we do our X sub n minus 1 look at that X is 1 is 9 some of you guys on your tested X sub n plus 1 for this one you were counting further than you should have been counting before not after so X sub n minus 1 gives us our 9 and then our last one whatever it is in 10 in this case no to here we plug them into our function that's what we have our one over this one over this one over X of 3 1 over X sub 10 and we just figured decimal equivalent so in our case on your calculator you get 1 plus 2 over this it's 2 into this through that and then multiply that by 120 now as you're doing that I'm going to go ahead on actually I did this on purpose I did the integral because we can actually do it I want to see how close this actually is so if we were to really do the integral so people work on this some of you guys really go through this okay I want I want an actual answer so but if we were to do an integral with what we know now we know the integral of 1 or X is Ln X and we would evaluate that from 1 to 2 that's Ln of 2 minus Ln of 1 well ml element 1 is 0 so we get Ln of 2 + Ln 2 is about equal to someone who's not working on this can you tell me what Ln of 2 is about equal 2.6 died and 3 14.6 not saving in 6 9 31 or okay it keeps on going because it's it it consider a rational number it goes on forever without ever meeting have you got this one what you get yeah is it exactly the same is it close tenths hundredths step it's the same to the thousands it's off by a little over six ten thousandths so with if you but here's the point this was clicker because we know how to do it right if this was an integral that we did know how to do this would be the best way because you don't know how to do it so you okay we'll call let's evaluate this approximately let's use our trapezoidal rule and then we get something that's relatively close now question how do you make this better more terms na plus C cos is definite integral how do you make it better we're in Morgan's do that to like a hundred it's really close I don't mean very much but really close because what's happening is you're taking our interval and make it really really living bill it's the same idea with doing Vermont sounds with more and with N equals larger numbers you're making smaller rectangles smaller rectangles well hey if you have smaller rectangles that means you're missing less and less area when you add up those rectangles if you remember back to your your month sums that you did in calculus or that making sense to you so the major that is the more close this is going to be I just want to do this one to show you hey you know what you can actually proximately get it pretty darn close dividends if I explain that long for you okay this is it for trapezoid rule that's how it works I'm going to give you a super sense rule show you how Simpsons rule differs here's how Simpsons world works Simpsons rule is going to look really really similar here's only difference instead of taking Delta X divided by two you take Delta X you're going to divide by three then what you do yeah it's cool it's awesome electors - then what you do is you take and you start with the same f of X of zero but this becomes a four that stays in tune and you're going to go for two four two four two four two four two and end of the pole right there and then that last one doesn't get anything now this will only work if n is even and it's got to be even so you can't do this if n is five you could do it if n is six sort of ends eight or two or like what even numbers are you do it evens but other than that this small report make sure I wrote down right to it in from memory but yeah I think I got it years when do an example your real quick yes because this makes sense to you that we're going to alternate fours and twos just you don't end the to you that that's going to happen if you have an eating okay so it's going to be nothing then four two four two four two four two four nothing thank you for your very less terms will happen as me so let me change this just a little bit how about 1 over square root X plus 1 from 0 to 2 with N equals 7 is that ok why not it has to be even find sticklers is 6 and 6 go through the same way that you would normally do the trapezoidal rule only now we're just going to plug into a different formula the Delta X is calculated the same way the X sub i's are calculated the same way and it just has to be satisfying the tens even ok so Delta egg what's nothing X is going to be going to be 1/3 that's right I'd probably leave that as a fraction 1/3 because I don't want I do not do not want you to approximate in just 2.3 or 0.33 because you're going to be losing something there ok and you're essentially going to be losing it every time you multiply every time you have a term because of that distribution property the approximation be way off so leave this as a fraction unless you can have a finite decimal you listening right now okay so leave it as a fraction okay well cool now let's do our X's so we want X sub 0 we want X sub 1 like sub 2 and so on what's X sub 0 going to be what's X sub 0 say it louder what you say 0 yeah you start with a 0 0 no problem ok well now if I have X sub 0 0 what's X sub 1 you know that one it's give me 1/3 because you guys see that the point in doing this well maybe you don't see the point in actually doing this we're trying to approximate intervals integrals without actually doing them we start with that number you just keep on adding this your Delta X per term that's what this says is that start with your a Judas NRA is 0 right now you get it you start with a just add Delta X that's it just add it every single time so what 0 plus 1/3 if we do know how to do fractions so what's 1/3 plus 1/3 2/3 now 100 X sub 3 what's up 2/3 plus 1/3 3/3 1 what's X sub 4 4/3 what's X sub 5 5 thirds and what's X sub 6 6 thirds yay so it makes me locate with that one so what I don't have all the all the terms in this particular one just so we feel through it again sometime so our integral can be approximated by doing this we start with Delta X how much is done X 1/3 1/3 we divided by what people carry very good and then we have this wholesome we have how's it start we see the apps f of zero very good f of zero then we add oh what's the next thing for board starts before four times f of 117 plus what 2 2 goes you know it works starts with nothing then it goes for then it goes to F of 2/3 then it goes to what for fo and then it goes back to 2 with a head for 4/3 then it goes back to for F of 5/3 and then it is what please F of yeah but notice there's nothing here so see how it's going to work it's going to always start with a full clips are done they there with nothing start with 4 and with a 4 and we're going to have one extra force it's going to pair up Bam Bam with an extra 4 it's not going to go back to the deciding to get there we use our even ends you're going to be located with this one are you sure ok and you can see if I went to N equals 8 what's going to happen is I'm going to have another tuna to the four go into tentative another children before it's always going to end with that 4 and then then that last term without anything in front of it so what do we do with all these numbers what are we to do with them look you pull you into what function yep right there so this is going to be approximately 1 9 3 okay 1 over square root 0 plus 1 plus 4 over square root of 1 3 plus 1 plus 2 over square root of 2/3 plus 1 plus 4 over square root of 1 plus 1 plus 2 over square root of 4 thirds plus 1 plus 4 over square root 5 30 plus 5 plus nothing 1 well not nothing 1 over square root of 2 plus 4 and if you do that and add them all up and then multiply by 1/9 then we get an approximation what I'd like to know is a show fans if you understand where all these things are coming from 2 events if you do guys on the right are you guys ok with this ok so this is what I had to bring your calculate in your calculator because there's a what I can be able to do this in our heads very easily so we're approximate here where it's okay to get our decimals so we got one that you add that X square divide 4 by it and so on and so forth and so on and so forth and so on and so forth now I've already done it you guys can go ahead and see if you can check my work but just for the sake of time it's going to take a little while right so here's what it is what it ends up giving you is approximately one point four six four to one is what that is Japan's relocated with the idea now what I want to do I want you guys to do the interval because we do know how to do this one we were kind of pretended we did don't want you to do that integral over here and just see what how good that approximation is all right so go forward like you to check my work to make sure that we all got the same thing did you get about that I should just get exactly that shouldn't know you got the two square root of x plus one if you plug back in the X before you start evaluating perfect that's fantastic so we got two or three minus two how much is two times the square root of three minus two one point eight four six four 101 is that one more time one point four six four one zero one six okay that's good enough that's our our decimal place is it exactly the same is it close it's really stinking close look at that this is a one point four six four one this is one point four six four two it's off by a little over one ten-thousandth after only six n equals six so six iterations that's that's not too bad so that's pretty darn close for approximately something if we didn't know how to do it so that's a lot of the trapezoidal rule works that's how Simpsons rule works have I explained it well enough for you guys to understand yeah oh wait no I'm just kidding
